D: OK, and if you were to a palpate or press on areas of your foot or joints of your toes, are you feeling any any pains along the top of your foot or or in any of your other toes?

P: None of my other toes.

D: OK, and how about any pains at the ankle?

P: Um no pain at the ankle.

D: OK, so the metatarsals are not having any pain and then the joints of the 2nd 5th digits are pain free along with the ankle as well. Um and when it comes to range of motion, are you able to flex your toes downwards and extend them upwards towards your nose?

P: Yes, I can do that.

D: OK, and how about your ankle, are you able to um move your ankle on a full range of motion.

P: I can.

D: OK, and are you having a limping with, walking or otherwise called an antalgic gait?

P: Somewhat because I'm trying not to put too much weight on my right big toe.

D: OK. Alright, and so I think that was everything that I wanted to ask and check today. So did you have any other questions or anything that I maybe forgot to ask about you wanted to mention today?

P: Um no just what can I do for my foot how do I make the swelling go down?

D: Yeah, for sure it's so right now with having a like a red, warm and swollen joint that that's extremely tender and has limited range of motion. It's important to rule out a septic arthritis, however. Based on several of the risk factors such as diabetes, and obesity, as well as your family history of arthritis and gout. Taking the most likely thing is that this is a gout flare, and in particular in the toe like that it could be called podagra and so we will need to get a aspiration of the joint fluid just to send it off and make sure that it's not not an infection and that we're treating the right thing. If this is, gout and it comes back that this way it's treated with that high dose, high doses of anti inflammatories. I will start with medication called colchicine to help with this flare, and in the meantime, important things for preventing this in the future are diet and kind of lifestyle related with reducing things like red meats, alcohol, weight loss and um just trying to improve the diabetes management as well.

P: OK, that sounds great. Thank you.

D: Alright, thank you, we will get that started.",921.688,us_medical,,,,,,,,

D: Okay, alright, so those are all the questions I had for you. We'll do like a full physical examination, take a look at your knee, um, and most likely, what this sounds like, is something called septic arthritis. It's uh, it's when there's like an infection that um, can go into your joints and uh, it is a pretty serious issue that we need to um, assess and treat as soon as possible. So the first thing that we will um, need to do, we'll need to do some blood work just to get some inflammation markers and just your uh, CBC, and see if you have um, an infection. However, we'll also need to do a joint aspiration of your of your um, go your knee, and we'll be taking some fluid within your joint called the synovial fluid and assess for um, we'll send in for um, culture, and look for like these crystals, and count. And then based on that, we'll understand um, the infection you have and what kind of infection you have. We will start you on antibiotics right away um, today, and so you will be um, here for a while until we get all those results back. And you may also require um, an admission today as well.

D: OK, alright so. You'll get some pain at the at the shoulder with the movement.

P: There there is discomfort in the affected side, but I can I can move it much more than I can move my elbows or anything like that. 

D: OK, I see. So I think that was everything that I wanted to ask about and and I look for on on the physical today. Was there anything I may be missed or anything like that? 

P: Uhm no I think, uh, I don't have any other questions.

D: OK, alright, so based on the history and what you're telling me for the physical as well of having a history of exercising and also shoulder pain with overhead head movements which are risk factors for developing a biceps, tendon tear or biceps tendon injury. And having the swelling and bruising as well as reduced function of biceps or elbow flexion, they all suggests that there is a biceps, tendon tear, or injury there, and so will want to get an ultrasound or MRI to look at will start with the ultrasound, but then possibly get an MRI as well to look at the extent of the tissue damage, but if there is just a long head of biceps tear, it will usually be treated conservatively. And so we'll just need to look to see what the extent of the injury is.

RES0073,data/us_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/RES0073.mp3,"D: Would you mind by starting with what brought you in?

P: Yeah, so over the last week I've just been feeling some symptoms. It kind of first started with, like a runny nose. That was around like 5 days ago and then it turned into just a lot of congestion, like around my nose and like my throat. And now over the last two days I've been just feeling so much pressure around my nose and around my jaw so I've been getting a lot of pain there as well.

D: OK, is your nose still running?

P: Yeah, I'm still getting some discharge and I also feel like I'm getting some dripping at the back of my throat too, especially when I wake up.

D: OK, and could you describe the discharge? Is it clear, yellow, greenish?

P: Uh, it's fairly clear and sometimes, like a bit white, but like, it's not like green or yellow.

D: OK, uh, and have you felt that it's difficult to breathe in through either of your nostrils, like it's obstructed?

P: Yeah, so at night sometimes I have to like turn because one side of my nose gets difficult to breathe from and then it kind of balances out on the other side. So yeah, I do have some obstruction.

D: OK, and have you had any changes to your sense of smell?

P: Yeah, so just in the last three days when the congestion got really bad I started losing the ability to smell.

D: OK, have you had any changes to your sense of taste?

P: Uh, no. No cough or sore throat.

P: I did kind of have a runny nose last week as well, so probably like 8 days ago but then the runny nose discontinued a little bit but really got worse 5 days ago, but all these other symptoms just happened in the last few days.

D: OK, and you have pain. Do you feel it in your jaw or do you feel it in the in the front of your nose?

P: Yes, I would say mainly over the cheeks. It can kind of go near the front of my teeth as well, so like I would say like mostly around the cheeks, jaws and up to the front of my teeth. 

D: OK, And do you grind your teeth at all at night? or have you had, TMJ issues before?

P: No nothing like that. I think it's not so much on and around my teeth, it's more so just to right below my nose, above my teeth and just around my cheeks.

D: OK, so no pain in your mouth or anything like that?

P: No, not inside my mouth.

D: OK, have you had any fevers or chills?

P: No.

D: OK, and you said you didn't have a cough or a sore throat, but have you had any wheezing?

P: Uhm, it's been mainly OK, just maybe sometimes difficult to get to sleep with all the all the congestion, but I don't think my energy has been affected too much, no.

D: OK, and, uh, sorry to go back to this, I don't think I asked. Did you notice any discharge from your eyes or any eye redness?

P: Not discharge, but yeah, maybe a little bit of redness.

D: OK, have your eyes been itchy?

P: Uhm Yeah, a little bit. I would say they have been a bit itchy.

D: OK, and do you have any allergies to medications or like environmental allergies that might be getting worse?

P: Uh, no, not that I know.

D: OK, so you don't experience any symptoms like this when the seasons change?

P: I don't think so. I have had this happen to me, Uh, I would say like once before. It happened like two years ago. It was pretty similar. 

D: OK, uhm, and what was done at that time?

P: At that time it kind of just went away on it's own. It got better. I feel it's definitely worse this time. But at that time I didn't even go to the doctor, it kind of just went away.

D: OK, I see. Any recent hospitalizations?

P: No hospitalizations.

D: Any surgeries?

P: Nope. 

D: Alright, and could you tell me where abouts you're living currently and who you're living with?

P: Yeah, so I'm currently living in an apartment by myself, just outside of London.

D: OK, and anybody that you've been around who's had any symptoms?

P: Uh, no, not that I know of.

D: OK, so no sick Contacts. And have you traveled anywhere out of the city or province?

P: No, I've tried to stay home, besides going to work. I just work at the grocery store. Besides that, no, nowhere else.

D: OK, and any of your coworkers have any symptoms? Or any coworkers being off sick?

P: No, we're pretty careful right now with the pandemic.

D: I see, yeah, that's great. OK, and do you smoke cigarettes?

P: No, I quit just a couple of years ago.

D: Oh, that's great. It's not easy to quit, so that's awesome. And do you drink alcohol?

P: Just maybe like red wine a couple of times a week.

D: I see, OK, and do you use any recreational drugs?

D: OK, uh, and anybody in the family have any lung or heart conditions?

P: No, not that I know of.

D: Alright, and how about any cancer in the family?

P: Uh, no, no cancers.

D: OK, I think I that was everything I wanted to ask about today. Was there any other symptoms or anything else that you wanted to make sure I knew about today?

P: No,  I think that's all. I just didn't know if I needed any, like, medications or if I needed to get tested. I just wanted to make sure.

D: Yeah, so well, certainly check your temperature to see if you have a fever. And if you do and it's high enough, that will increase the chance that you have a bacterial sinusitis,  and if so, with some of your symptoms, including the discharge, obstruction, loss of smell, and facial pain, that all fits the picture for it and also you had a period where you felt a little bit better and then worse again. So that might require antibiotics, but we will check your temperature and go from there. 

P: Alright, sounds good, thank you so much.

D: OK, good. Does he have a sore throat at all?

P: No, not that he's told me. He's still eating things and I don't think he's having any trouble with eating anything, so I don't think so.

D: OK, that's good. Has he had a cough?

P: Uhm, actually he did. He did start coughing like yesterday, but just a few times a day. I don't know if it's because of this or like, what else might be going on.

D: OK. has he ever had ear pain before?

P: He did have a similar pain, I think when he was like around three years old, but it happened with his left left ear, not the right one.

D: OK, was he prescribed any medications?

P: Uh yeah, he was given a, like a course of antibiotics at that time. I forgot what it was called, but I think at that time it was much worse, like he, I don't know if he was just younger and couldn't tolerate it but I think he also had a fever at that time.

D: OK, OK, and then any other ear infections outside of that one time.

P: No, I think that, only that one I can recall.

D: OK, alright, is he otherwise healthy?

P: Yeah, otherwise he's healthy. No, other conditions or anything like that.

D: And any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions.

P: No lung or heart conditions. Just, his father does have like celiac disease, so I don't know if that's related at all.

D: OK, how old was he when was diagnosed with celiac?

P: Fairly young I would say, in his 20s.

D: OK, OK, uhm, alright, we'll keep an eye on it in him, like if he has any changes in his bowel movements or if he's getting severe abdominal pain after eating certain foods with gluten you can get him checked up for that as well.

P: OK. 

D: Yeah and then, in terms of where he lives, does he live with you and your partner?

P: Yeah, so it's just, he's an only child, lives with me and my husband, and also we have like a pet dog.

D: OK, do you live in an apartment or in a house?

P: We live in a, it's like a condominium.

D: OK, OK, any old carpet, mold or asbestos in the building?

P: No, no, nothing like that. It's fairly well kept. 

D: OK, And is he other-wise like developmental-wise, he's OK? There's no past history of like developmental disorders, anything like that?

P: No, no issues from like when he was younger like no complaints at all. I Think he was doing the same as every other child.

D: OK, no complications during your pregnancy with him, no complications during the actual delivery and then when he was a newborn?

P: Uh no, no complications, it was just a vaginal birth at 39 weeks and we didn't need to stay in the hospital at all afterwards.

D: OK, good. So those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?

P: Yeah, I don't know if, uh, like last time we did get some antibiotics. I don't know if he needs them right now or what would you recommend?

D: Yeah, uhm so I'm gonna have to take a look into his ears first before I can come up with like a management plan for him. So once I do, if I see, uhm, if his tympanic membrane has been perforated or I see pus in there, we'll prescribe him like 10 days of antibiotics. We can give him either Amoxicillin, or if he has bad reactions to penicillins,  we can give him Cefuroxime and then if, uh, it doesn't seem to have any systemic symptoms, so if he has systemic symptoms like fever, which we'll check for today, and if he's like been really ill and he has like a middle ear effusion or bulging tympanic membrane, again we'll give him antibiotics for 10 days. But if his tympanic membrane is just bulging a little bit, or if he has some middle ear effusion but no systemic symptoms, like, no fevers, and he seems to be fine otherwise, we'll reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see if he's better and if he's not, again, will prescribe him antibiotics. How does that sound?

P: Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you.

RES0177,data/us_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/RES0177.mp3,"D: What brings you in?

P: I brought my son in today because he had a fever that started two days ago and, and then since then he he's had a cough that started as well and it it he's been short of breath. It looks like he's like breathing faster and just having a harder time to breathe.

D: OK, uhm, before the fever, did you notice any other symptoms, like a runny nose or a stuffy nose?

P: No, nothing like that. Yeah, the fever kind of came on pretty, pretty suddenly it seemed like.

D: OK. Uhm, how much shortness of breath is he having? Is it just when he's exerting himself or is it at rest as well?

P: I'd say ah, even at rest now he's like breathing faster.

D: OK, umm, and it does anything help with that? So does sitting up help? Or, uh, you know, getting fresh air or anything like that?

P: No. But you'd say, like taking a smaller breaths helps because like if he if he takes a deep breath and he gets, he gets like chest pain. 

D: OK, OK, and how about when he's laying down?

P: No, he hasn't said anything like, like that for laying down just I think when he's just taking a deep breath, he said.

P: Yeah, maybe, he has a younger sister that goes to daycare and she was sick last week with like she had a cough and stuff as well.

D: OK. OK, and does she have a fever as well?

P: She did, yeah, she got better. Right uh, last week we we had to take her to to see the doctor and she got antibiotics for that. Actually for, for a few days. 

D: OK, OK. And have you traveled anywhere recently?

P: No, we've been at home.

D: OK. Does anyone at home smoke?

P: No. 

D: No, OK. And who lives at home with him?

P: So it's me, his mom, and then his younger sister.

D: OK. Any old carpets, mold, dust, asbestos, anything that could exacerbate his condition?

P: No, I don't think so. It's a newer home. 

D: OK, good. Umm, so those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own?

P: Uhm, no, I, no that was everything I think. The only I I guess other thing that that I forgot to mention is that just he doesn't really like his appetite's been a little bit lower couple of days as well. But uh, he hasn't had any, like nausea or vomiting though.

D: OK, OK, yeah, that's good to know. Uhm, so because some of his symptoms overlap with those of Covid, we will do a swab on him and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results and he should isolate for 14 days because of those symptoms. And it doesn't, it sounds more in keeping with the picture of community acquired pneumonia, so for that we will get a chest x-ray, we'll check his oxygen and his temperature and if the chest x-ray shows consolidation umm, or some sort of infiltrate, it is likely that he has pneumonia. So, we will start by giving him some amoxicillin populate or cefuroxime for five days, and just keep monitoring his symptoms. They should resolve in about 5 days when the course of antibiotics is complete. If his condition gets worse like he's getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, just take him to the ER. And if symptoms don't resolve in five to seven days, we can do further work up or things like fungal infections or TB, or things like that. How does that sound?

P: That sounds great. Thank you.

D: OK, yeah, no problem.",642.1676875,us_medical,,,,,,,,

P: I feel like it's uh pretty normal, mostly home cooked meals with some variety, vegetable, vegetables, other meats, and fish. I would say it's pretty balanced.

D: OK, alright, I just have a few more questions for you. Um are you currently sexually active? 

P: Yes, I am.

D: OK and who are you sexually active with, any new partners at all?

P: Uh no new partners, um just my girlfriend, uh. 

D: And, uh, how many, I'm sorry, go ahead.

P: Um just my my girlfriend recently. 

D: OK, and have you been sexually active with more than one partner in the past, past year? 

P: Uh yes, I have, um um two women over the past year. 

D: OK, and um do you use any kind of protection?

P: Yes, always use uh condoms.

RES0217,data/us_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/RES0217.mp3,"D: So I understand you removed insects from your leg earlier today?

P: Yes I did, it was uh it was behind my left uh knee kind of in like the joint behind where it bends. Um it was stuck pretty good, it's still kind of red and tender there. I noticed it because the back of my knee was starting to just feel a bit sore, um not the joint itself, but just kind of the skin, the whole area back there. Um and I found this tick, I brought I brought it in with me if you wanted to have a look at it, um it's in like this little plastic container, uh and I don't really know when I got it. I was hiking on Friday um and then Saturday I was out in my garden, I hope they're not around my house, I hope that it was from hiking um and not gardening, but uh I did spend a lot of time outside on Saturday as well.

D: OK, so sounds like it's been a little bit of time since you were last outdoors to when you first noticed it?

P: Yeah.

D: OK, so when you picked it off the tick, obviously you have it for me, is it quite swollen or engorged?

P: It's not too bad, um I I have actually had a tick in the past and this is a long time ago and um maybe like 10 years and I actually had that kind of target rash thing that they talk about. And, uh at that time I remember I had to take antibiotics for a bit. Um this um didn't look like that, it was more, it was just kind of sore in one spot, I don't think it um it was as bad as that time and the tick that time, sorry I've kind of gotten off track, that time it was quite swollen, this one was maybe a little bit, but not as much.

D: OK, so just in terms of the tick's size, it doesn't look like it's been feeding for too long, so when ticks uh are feeding they tend to engorge, they tend to swell up, so this looks more like a tiny little bug or does it kind of look like a little grape, almost like it's been swollen up with blood?

P: No, this one, this one's pretty small.

D: This one's pretty small, OK. And I should mention that, well obviously you've had a tick bite in the past, the big concern for us is a disease called Lyme disease, which is spread by bacteria, but in fact only one type of tick predominantly is a transmission transmitory agent for it. It's called a deer tick, and its coloration, it's got a little bit of a brown butt and there's some black legs. Does it look like that at all?

P: I don't think so, uhm, I uh I was looking at the pictures online, I think it looks like the other kind of tick, um but I heard that, yeah, but I heard that lately now they've been considering all ticks in this area as possibly carriers of Lyme um because I think it's kind of become more more of a problem sm so that was making me a bit nervous.

D: OK, absolutely, what we can do is we can send this tick off to the lab and they'll be able to identify the species for it, but for tick bites in general, one of the key considerations is for how long it's been on your body for. So unfortunately, if you're out on Friday and Saturday, that'd mean that this tick has been on you for longer than at least 72 hours. So I think one way or another, we're likely going to have to put you on antibiotics just as kind of a prophylactic at the very least, just want to make sure that um you're not at risk of developing Lyme disease. I'm sure you've heard from the news that Lyme disease can present in a variety of ways, but it's a disease that we try our best to avoid. And just in terms of your symptoms, so you say you've had a bite in the past and you you've got that rash before, that kind of bullseye rash, do you have that rash now?

P: No, I don't uh as far as I know, I mean, you can have a look too. It's behind my knee, so it's not the easiest place to see, but it's uh it looks a little red, it's like tender where the tick was, but I don't see that like larger circle rash.

D: OK, that's reassuring. Now any, it'd be pretty unlikely for you to have other symptoms, but just in case, do you have any other joint pain? 

P: No.

D: Have you been feeling ill or have been feverish in the last little while?

P: No, no, I've been fine.

D: OK, and you removed that twit tick once you found it, you presented to me, have you checked your body for any other possible bites?

P: Oh yeah, I looked around and I looked at my husband too 'cause we we were just a little bit, you know, gave us a little bit of a scare, but no, there's been nothing else.

D: That's good. And did you bring a pet with you at all when you were hiking and gardening?

P: Uh no, I didn't, no.

D: OK, good. Any other family members you think might have been exposed?

P: Uh no it was just uh me and my husband.

D: OK, and what geographic area were you in um when you were hiking?

P: We were uh in Strathroy along the creek.

D: OK. I can do, if I remember there's a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario and we can see exactly how that lines up to see if we should be a little bit concerned or not. Looks like Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point, so I think that we will be moving forward with antibiotics, but of course we'll be talking to the physician who'll be having a look at you as well. So it sounds like you haven't been having too much symptoms aside from you've noticed this tick, the skin around it is fairly sore and you've had this in the past, but you were treated with antibiotics in the past and since then you haven't had too many health problems after that?

P: No, no. I've been pretty healthy.

D: OK, and just about your health right now, is there anything that you see the family physician or doctor for in general and regarding your health?

P: Uh just for my cholesterol.

D: OK, are you taking and medications for that?

P: Uh Yeah, I take a uh statin, can't remember which one. 

D: OK, got it. And do you have any allergies?

P: Uh no.

D: So no drug allergies?

P: No.

D: OK, now we've already talked about other exposures, so it doesn't sound like anyone else in your family or any pets are around, so it's unlikely that you have ticks coming in and you said you might have gotten this from gardening, but um you're hoping that your area doesn't have ticks. Maybe just take a look, ticks like to live in long grass, kind of on the intersection between woods and fields to see if there's any hovering around that kind of make a waving motion with their legs and they're sometimes easy to spot, you might wanna get some insecticide out there. But it sounds like this is fairly recent, unfortunately just for the length of time this tick might be on you for, it's probably safer than not to start you on some medications, but I'm going to go talk to the doctor after we do a quick physical exam, and we might also send the tick off to a local laboratory so they can identify the species for it definitively, as well as might just send some blood work just to see if there's any titres or any serology that would make us a little bit more concerned for Lyme disease. But aside from that you've been feeling well otherwise?

P: Yeah, totally fine. It was just a little tender there and that's the only reason I looked.

D: OK. So no headaches?

P: No.

D: Nothing like that?

P: Nothing like that. 

D: OK, excellent, alright. I'm fairly happy with what we talked about today. Do you have any questions for me Jean? 

P: No, this is pretty well what I expected today, so thanks for helping me out.

D: No problem. OK, I'll go talk to the doctor, we'll come back and talk to you, OK? 

P: Great, thanks.

MSK0046,data/us_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/MSK0046.mp3,"D: What brings you here today?

P: Um I'm here because my left hand, kind of just like at the base of my thumb, has been hurting for the past two days and it seems to be getting worse, um and I'm left handed so it's really hard for me to write or do anything um where I have to like, clench or grip things.

D: OK, and how long has this been going on for?

P: Uhm, so for the past two days, but it's got, it got bad yesterday.

D: OK, and have you had any, uh if you were to describe the pain, where is it located exactly?

P: It's just at the base of my thumb. Uh you know where the fleshy part of your hand is?

D: OK yeah yeah.

P: Yeah, so just just over there.

D: OK, and what kind of pain is it? Is it sharp or is it aching?

P: Uhm, it's it's like a um, at baseline it's an achy pain, but if I try to move it or um try to write or you know, use a computer or anything like that, it becomes sharp. 

D: OK, Um and on a scale of uh zero to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've felt in your life, how much would you rate it?

P: I'd say like a 6.

D: OK, and does this pain move anywhere else in your hand, or does it just stay where you described?

P: Um it just stays there. 

D: OK, and what kind of motions uh cause the most pain?

P: I'd say like um you know, trying to touch my pinky with my thumb, that that hurts. Um just like trying to rotate it hurts.

D: OK, um have you tried anything for the pain that has helped? 

P: Uhm, no, I haven't really tried too much. I've just I just tried not to use it as much.

D: I see. OK. And um, has this ever like, have you ever had any injuries to this hand? Any trauma either recently or in the past?

P: No, no, nothing like that.

D: OK. Alright, and is there any, do you do any kind of repetitive work that requires gripping or lifting um with that hand, anything repetitive?

P: So I do a lot of work at the computer. And um I guess I tend to type a lot with my left hand, so maybe that.

D: OK.

P: And sorry I also take lots of notes, like handwritten notes with my left hand.

D: OK, so are you left handed? 

P: Yes.

D: OK. Alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?

P: No. 

D: No, so you're healthy?

P: Yes.

D: Um do you take any medications on a regular basis? 

P: Uh no, no.

D: No, OK. Any allergies to any medications?

P: Um no allergies.

D: OK, um any previous surgeries or hospitalizations?

P: No.

D: No, any family history of any medical conditions, whether it's musculoskeletal, rheumatological, any conditions?

P: Uh no, nothing like that.

D: OK, um any cancers in the family?

P: Um I know there's, yeah there's a lot of cancer in the family. There's colon cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer. 

D: OK. And are they first degree relatives who had those cancers?

P: Uh no first degree relatives, just like aunts and uncles. 

D: OK. Uh alright, and currently are you working right now or have you had any time off work or any modified duties?

P: Um so I'm still working online, I've just um haven't been taking notes by hand anymore.

D: I see, and does that help though? 

P: Uh yeah it it has helped a little bit because I'm not moving my hand as much so it helps with the pain. 

D: OK. Have you taken any uh Tylenol, Advil, anything for the pain? 

P: No, I haven't.

D: OK. Alright. And currently right now, what is your living situation like?

P: Uh I live in an apartment by myself.

D: OK, and um, do you currently uh smoke cigarettes? 

P: Um I smoke, I used to smoke like five years ago, and I only did that for like a year or two, um and it wasn't very much. But I don't smoke anymore.

D: OK, that's good. Um any alcohol?

P: Um I'll have like a beer on the weekend.

D: OK. Any recreational drugs like marijuana?

P: Um I will take an edible like once a month.

D: OK. Um and yeah, those were just some of the questions I had um and we're just going to do a few things for examining, examining uh that area. So are you able to make a fist?

P: Um I can, but it hurts.

D: OK, it hurts in that location that you mentioned?

P: Yes. 

D: How about um if you make a fist without your thumb, does it still hurt or is it just when you are moving the thumb?

P: It's just when I'm moving the thumb.

D: OK. And if you were able to, are you able to uh rotate your wrist?

P: Uh yes, I can rotate my wrist.

D: Does that hurt at all? 

P: No.

D: OK, um now I just want you to do this one test. It's called a Finkelstein test. OK so I want you to flex your thumb, press it up down against your palm.

P: OK. 

D: And then hold your hand, sorry.

P: No, go ahead.

D: Yeah, and then after you do that, um, bring your fingers above your thumb, so just cover your thumb.

P: OK.

D: Kind of like a fist, but your thumb is on the inside of your fingers.

P: OK.

D: And then bring your uh arm out.

P: OK. 

D: And with your other hand, can you, from above push your wrist downwards? So your uh pinky finger is uh pointing to the pointing to the ground.

P: OK, yep.

D: Yeah, and did that hurt at all? Like when you, so this is just called ulnar deviation or your um of your wrist. Does that hurt at all?

P: Yes, that is very painful.

D: That's very painful, OK. Alright, um and then you're also having pain with gripping and, OK, so those are kind of all the things I wanted to ask. Uh it seems that you may be having something called De Quervain's tenosynovitis. Um it's caused by some repetitive motions, uh it can be due to gripping. Sometimes it happens to new mothers who are lifting their children as well as daycare workers. It can also happen in other work environments, and so what we will first just need to do um is mainly to rule out something like osteoarthritis. You are fairly young um but if there was ever an injury in the past, it you can have early osteoarthritis in the area. So we just want to get an X-Ray. And other than that, the way we kind of deal with this issue is usually conservatively and with a splint. 

P: OK. 

D: And a sling for your thumb that uh helps relieve some of these symptoms, uh restricts some of your movements, reduces some of the swelling, and if it does get really bad and it's affecting your work and conservative management with pain and the splint don't work, and with physiotherapy, we do uh offer injecting corticosteroids into just right like in the area that you mentioned, right below the thumb.

P: OK. 

D: Um and that often has some effect as well. Um but at first, yeah, let's just do some conservative management and see if that helps. It's only been a few days, so hopefully um what we try first helps. And then we can go on from there.

P: OK yeah, that sounds great. Thank you. 

D: Welcome, take care.

P: You too.",620.6140625,us_medical,,,,,,,,
RES0104,data/us_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/RES0104.mp3,"D: Can you tell me what brings you in here today?

D: OK. Uhm, any anything that makes your symptoms better or worse that you've tried?

P: I did try some over the counter cold medicine. It, I think it might have helped me sleep last night, but didn't really do a whole lot.

P: Uh, not really. It's kind of always there,

P: No, my weight's been about the same.

P: Like I've considered it, but I I just don't think it, it'll be possible at this time.

D: OK, well if you at all are wanting any information or want to talk about quitting at all, um, we can provide more resources. Do you besides smoking, do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana?

P: No.

D: No. Any alcohol at all?

P: No.

D: OK. Yeah, so those are some of the questions I had a, I will be doing a physical examination with your shortness of breath. I just want to get a good listen to your lungs and take all your vitals as well. However, yeah so after that since you're having some symptoms of what might be a pneumonia, it can be a bacterial infection, a viral infection, we will have to get some blood work done as well as a chest x-ray. And right now, with the pandemic going on, we will also do Covid swab test for you as well, just in case. Does that sound good?

P: Yeah, that makes sense, thank you.

D: Alright and, if if you're while you're here, if your shortness of breath gets any worse at all, just let us know and we'll help you out.

D: OK. And so do you drink? do you drink alcohol?

P: I have had a sip of wine, but that's that's about it.

D: OK, great. And has anybody in your family had had similar symptoms?

P: No, I don't think so. 

D: OK, um and anybody in the family have asthma or lung conditions?

P: I think my aunt has asthma but I was I was checked for asthma when I was younger and it turns out I don't have it.

D: OK, and any diseases that run in the family like genetic or congenital?

P: I think Crohn's disease.

D: OK, and umm, who in the family has that?

P: My father. 

D: OK, so that was everything that I wanted to ask today, was there anything else you wanted to tell me?

P: No, that's it. What do you think I have?

D: Well, it is sounding like it could be most likely an infectious type of process going on with the possibility of having a fever with a cough and sore throat. So we'll do a physical exam and also some investigations which will include a covid test today. Because some of these symptoms do overlap, but it could be something like the common cold. I don't know the virus that's bringing this on but it's not necessarily covid. But because we're doing the test, it will require 14 days of self isolation. We'll get back to you with the results as quickly as we can.

RES0171,data/us_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/RES0171.mp3,"D: What brings you in today?

P: Yeah, I've had a shortness of breath, and even at at rest. Really, feeling like it's difficult to breathe, and when I take a deep breath I get a chest pain.

D: When did this start?

P: This started yesterday.

D: How bad is your shortness of breath?

P: Like, I don't know. I feel like I'm OK, like n terms of being able to breathe, but I mean if I exert myself at all, there's no way I would be able to. It's, I just feel like even at rest it's hard to breathe.

D: OK, has it gotten worse since yesterday or better, or kind of been the same?

P: It's mostly been that been the same or actually sorry it's got, got a little bit worse at first. It was more more with exertion, and now it's, at rest as well. So yeah, it's got worse. 

D: I see, OK. Are you able to talk in full sentences or do you need to take a deep like stop to take a breath?

P: I could talk in full sentences. 

D: And the chest pain, does it only occur when you take a deep breath, or are there other times as well?

P: I pretty much yeah only when I'm taking a deep breath and say, I mean, maybe that's why part of the I can't take a deep breath so it's making me feel it's making the breathing more difficult making me feel more short of breath. 

D: OK. Any other symptoms that you've had? A fever or headache?

P: No, nothing like that. 

D: Any cough? 

P: Yeah, I, I've had a cough as well over that the same same time period.

P: No, I don't.

D: And, who do you.. do you currently live alone?

P: Uh no, I live with my husband and and our two sons. 

D: OK and, do you, have anyone sort of come in to help you out over these past two weeks? Are you getting any outside help from nurses etc. Or are your are your family members being supportive and helpful? 

P: Yeah, it's been mostly the the family members. My husband's been working from home and the kids have been helpful as well. They are 10 and 12 so they are able to do some things on their own so yeah they've been supportive.

D: That's great. That's great. OK, and you smoke at all?

P: I do yes I I smoke about a half a pack per day. 

D: For how long?

P: Um, yeah, but I I started in my, yeah, after the kids were born actually, uh so like 10 years ago.

D: OK, have you tried cutting it down at all? 

P: Yeah, I have. I've kind of gone through spurts of quitting and restarting, quitting and restarting. So yeah, I've tried before.

D: OK, and what about marijuana or recreational drugs?

P: No, don't use anything like that.

D: And alcohol? 

P: Yeah I'll have some wine on the on the weekends, but maybe that's like a glass or two.

D: OK, OK uhm, and do you have any medical conditions that long run in the family?

P: Just, uh, yeah, my father actually had a stroke when he was 68, and that's it.

D: OK OK uhm. You haven't ever had one, have you?

P: No, I I haven't had anything like that. 

D: OK, alright. So. I guess come to in terms of smoking, you said that you've tried to quit a couple of times in the past. Do you intend on trying again? I know it can be very hard to, to quit smoking.

P: Yeah, it's only something that is always kind of in the back of my mind.

D: OK, if there's I'm happy to assist you and share resources and problems like medications and things like that that could help you if you're interested so we can talk more about that. talking about your I guess you mentioned that your weight is a little higher than or, its outside the normal range, is that something that you would like to cut down?

P: Yeah, I really try to eat more vegetables and have been trying to do that sort of thing. I've lost a few pounds, but not enough, definitely want to keep going.

D: OK, good good, as long as you feel that you what you're currently doing is helping you and is helping you reduce weight. That's great. But also I'm here for you if you need more education or guidance on that. So, given what you've told me so far, it sounds like you might have developed a clot in your leg somewhere, simply because you had a surgery and you were not moving around very much. Sometimes that causes the blood to kind of, not move around your body is as as much as it usually does, and kind of stays in one place and get turned into a clot and that clot can sometimes get dislodged and settle into your lungs, and that can make it difficult for you to breathe. So, we'll do some tests that that's what my understanding is. Given what you've told me so far, but we do have to confirm it using a test. Also, the fact that you smoke and your weight, and your BMI is high, increases your risk of developing a clot, so I would definitely strongly recommend that you continue to try to reduce both and try to quit smoking. And so we'll do an ultrasound of your leg and we'll do a scan of your chest and see what's going on and then decide if we need to give you any medications, like any blood thinning medications.

P: OK, yeah, that sounds really good. Thank you.

The coughing also makes it difficult for me to breathe, you know, I feel very short of breath after that.

D: Yeah, certainly, uhm, how much blood have you coughed up?

D: Past week, OK. Um and did you injure your shoulder at all recently? Any trauma to the area or anything like that?

P: Um so about like, a couple of months ago, I um was do, I I work in construction so um I was moving around some heavy objects and um I guess like the repetitive motions caused some sort of rotator cuff injury. But I had that um, like I got that treated and everything was fine for a couple of months. But this pain just started a week ago.

D: OK, and where is this pain located exactly?

P: Um it's it's just like in my shoulder, like at the joint between my upper arm and um shoulder.

D: OK, and uh is it an aching pain or is it a sharp stabbing pain?

P: So at rest it seems to be like achy and stiff, but um but when I move my shoulder, when I try to move it, it it causes more of a sharp pain.

D: Sharp pain, OK and what kind of movements cause the sharp pain? Or is it just any movement?

P: Uh any movement.

D:  OK. Are there any uh movements that are worse in particular?

P: Um I've tried some ibuprofen, some ice. It seems to help temporarily.

D: OK, and earlier when you had the rotator cuff injury, did you get physiotherapy? 

P: Um I did. But not, but I didn't finish the full course. I just went for a week or so and then um I had to go back to work, um so I stopped doing that.

D: I see, um yeah, so that's something definitely uh it's very important and we'll need to consider going forward as well. Other than that, are you having any symptoms of any fevers or chills?

D: OK, that's good. Yeah, I mean, um we might also need to, if you're doing any kind of overhead like work where you're raising your arms above your shoulders, that might uh, cause further problems as well, so we'll look into some of those modified duties as well.

P: No.

D: OK, and again, no swelling, redness, or anything like that, just it's mainly just on the inside?

P: Yeah.

D: OK, and um and any kind of movement hurts, right? There's no particular movement that, like if you were instead of um trying to raise that shoulder by itself, if you were to just move it with the other arm. Does it hurt?

P: The other arm? The other arm doesn't hurt at all.

D: Or like if you were to use your left arm to to passively move your right arm and shoulder. Does that hurt or is it when you just try to move the right arm by itself?

P: It's, oh, it still hurts, any any moving of the shoulder hurts.

D:  OK, alright, so yeah, so based on what um you've told me so far in your recent shoulder cuff injury, what can sometimes happen is uh with those injuries, you might get some um inflammation and what might happen is something called uh adhesive capsulitis, or just commonly knows as known as a frozen shoulder. And there's different stages, so that might happen, so in the initial stages like freezing um and then there's stiffening in stage two, and then usually after 6 to 12 months it starts uh getting better.

P: OK.

D: Um and it might also affect your other shoulder as well. So what we'll um end up doing today is see if um we can get some um imaging done so we can do an X-Ray of your shoulder. I'm sure you've had X Rays before, so we'll kind of compare them to your shoulder X Rays from before. We, if we need to, we can also get an ultrasound if um we don't, uh we can't really tell from the X Rays. And then from there, um we can get some blood work as well. Um just your normal blood work as well as inflammation markers, and then um from there we'll need to uh, really um discuss some management strategies. So you've already tried some physiotherapy, but now we need to make sure that's uh, it's it's consistent because this is something that has a high recurrence rate and we will definitely need to finish the full course of physiotherapy, whatever it may be, um because if physiotherapy doesn't work, we may have to consider like other options like um corticosteroid injections right into your shoulder.

P: OK. 

D: For some relief.  But yeah, so first we'll just try some conservative methods like physiotherapy, pain management, uh and then go from there. How does that sound?

P: That sounds pretty good. Thank you.

D: Welcome, alright, so we'll call you for the X-Rays and then we'll go from there.

P: OK, sounds good.",682.612625,us_medical,,,,,,,,

We'll do a physical exam, see, just listen to your chest, have a look inside your mouth and check your temperature and go from there.

P: Uhm, no, I was just like, well, really worried that I I could have lung cancer. 

D: Yeah, for sure. So that is quite high on my differential right now just because of your age, your smoking history and just the way you're presenting. So we're gonna do a couple of things. We're going to do a Covid swab just to rule that out. You should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours, but we will do investigations for lung cancer, so we'll start by doing a chest x-ray just to look for a mass or effusions and then from there if we think there are signs of cancer, we can do a CT. Umm, as well we can like stage with the Pet CT after we take a biopsy and send it off for pathology and that should give us more answers as to if you have cancer and if you do have cancer, what type of cancer so that we can talk about treatment plans and kind of what the prognosis is with those particular types of cancers? How does that sound?

P: Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you so much.

D: When did this start? 

P: Um, I would say started, uh probably 3 months back, but it's gotten worse, so like before I used to like just have some irritation in my throat and cough a little, but now, I would say probably every other day I'm having these episodes where I can't stop coughing when I'm exercising.

D: Hmm, um and is this cough a dry cough, or do you bring up some mucus?

P: It's usually, it's usually a dry cough and sometimes I do bring up like this light material, but usually it's mostly a dry cough.

D: You never notice any blood, right?

P: No, no blood.

D: OK and uhm, it started about three months ago, I guess before that did you ever have a problem when you would exercise or when you were vacuuming or cleaning, has this been a problem that has occurred for years and that's just something that you that got worse and now it's come to your attention? Or was it just very new and sudden, three months ago? 

P: Um, it's fairly new. I've never really had this issue before although I have been like so like after the new year in the winter I, I, I wasn't much of the person who ran or exercised a lot. But I, I kind of needed a new goal to become more fit and active. So I notice that, I don't know, maybe that's why like, it is something new that I've been trying, but yeah, it's not been an issue before.

D: OK, and other than the the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms like a sore throat or itchy eyes? Itchy nose? Stuffy nose or runny nose? Anything like that?

P: No, none of those, but I did it, initially I used to get just an irritation in my throat. But now it's just more of a cough.

D: OK. Do you have, do you get any pain in your chest at all?

P: Uh, when I'm usually it goes away in 10-15 minutes but when I'm coughing a lot I do get some tightness.

D: OK. Do you ever feel like you're short of breath when you're coughing or otherwise?

P: I do find that it's harder to take a breath at those times.

D: Ok. Uhm and how long do these last for? Episodes last for?

P: Probably, uh 15 to 20 minutes and yeah, it's it's mainly just after I like often times over the last few weeks I've had to just stop doing what I'm doing, like exercising and just come home and rest.

D: Do you feel like your hearts beating really fast when that happens or you're sweating?

P: Yeah, yeah, I I feel like it's usually, I don't know if it's because of the exercise, but I have like a Fitbit and it's my my heart rate is much faster. 

D: Uhm, OK. Alright. Have you had any other symptoms so anything, any pain in your belly or any nausea or vomiting?

D: Ok.

D: Do you feel like they may have put new curtains or or like there's old carpets or new a new pet, or something that could have caused some irritation for you?

P: No, but I have noticed that when I when we vacuum. I, I do get some of those symptoms as well. Just more of an irritation mores than the cough.

D: OK. OK, and do you feel that you're particularly anxious when these episodes are occurring? Do you have any new stressors in life?

P: Uh, no, not really.

D: Any medical conditions that run in the family?

P: Uhm, I don't think so. Not that I know of.

P: Uh well, I think it first started a few months ago, but in the past couple of weeks it has started to um kinda like last longer and and happen at rest as well.

D: Yeah, and so does anything make it worse or better? I assume doing any sort of physical activity makes it worse and rest makes it better, but how about anything other than that?

P: Uhm not really, yeah, it's mostly just the the activity, if I'm going upstairs or um downstairs or uh during running is really where it hurts the most and that's what's bugged me the um yeah, the most, running.

D: OK, OK, and if you were to describe the quality of this pain, would you say sharp, dull, achy, crampy?

P: Uh it's a sharp pain, uh almost like every time my foot hits the ground I get like a sharp stabbing pain and while I'm at at rest it feels a bit more dull, while, yeah, yeah while I'm at rest. 

D: OK, OK, and 1 to 10, 10 being the worst pain ever, how bad is this pain?

P: A six.

D: OK, alright, and have you ever experienced this type of pain before?

P: Uh I did have something similar like many years ago. I used to be a rower uh in undergrad and I got some similar pains before, and I mean with some stretching and um other I don't know kind of strengthening stuff, it it kind of helped but I didn't go see anybody for it at that time because it it kind of went away after a little while,

D: OK, OK, um and you said you were, are you still rowing?

P: No, no, the only activity that I'm doing now is is running.

D: Running, OK and from when it started to now, in the past couple of weeks has it changed like dramatically, um is it affecting your day to day life?

P: Uh a little bit, yeah, like even now, just walking I can I can feel it. Um the pain's not as severe but like as when I'm running but I can, I'm starting to notice it uh daily.

D: OK, alright, and um are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any um symptoms like fevers or chills? 

P: No, nothing like that.

D: No, any weight loss?

P: Uh no weight loss.

D: No, any rashes?

P: Uh no rashes.

D: No, OK. Um any um, do you do you do any smoking?

P: Uh no, I've tried uh like smoking marijuana in the past, but didn't really like it, so I've stayed away from that.

D: OK, how about um other recreational drugs?

P: Uh no, no, I I I haven't used anything like that before. 

D: OK, um and then where do you live right now? And who do you live with?

P: So um right now I just live on my own, actually I'm um just finishing up my my my Masters um and just live in a small apartment. 

D: OK alright. And have you been in contact with anyone sick recently?

P: No, I don't believe so.

D: OK. Um how about um travel?

P: Uh no, I've just been yeah finishing up the the thesis and running. 

D: OK, alright, um those were all the questions I had for you, um we'll move on to the physical exam component of this. Um so if you can take a look at both your knees, um do you see any visible redness or swelling in the area?

P: Uh no no swelling or yeah, nothing visible that I can see.

D: OK, so no bruises?

P: Uh no, no no bruises 

D: OK. Do you notice any like muscle atrophy, any deformities or skin changes otherwise?

P: No, everything looks looks normal.

D: OK, and if you can just um place your hand just kinda at the top of your, on top of your kneecap on both sides, do you notice any temperature changes from your, uh between your right knee to your left knee?

P: No, no temperature changes, they they feel the same.

D: OK. Um and then when you palpate your knee cap as well as um yeah, just if you could palpate just at the center of your kneecap, do you feel any pain there?

P: No pain over the kneecap, that feels fine.

D: OK. How about when you palpate kind of like the medial ligaments of your kneecap, do you feel any pain there?

P: No, everything on the medial side feels feels normal and fine.

D: How about when you palpate the lateral ligaments of your kneecap?

P: Yeah, the ligaments feel feel OK, on the lateral side though I I do get some pain along the um like above the joint line.

D: Above the joint line?

P: Yeah.

D: OK, OK, and how about when you palpate uh that big muscle group on your thighs like the quadriceps?

P: That feels OK, no pain in the muscles.

D: OK, how about like the patellar tendon?

P: Uh no pain there.

D: OK. And then when you go lower below your kneecap, um when you palpate like the top part where the proximal parts of your tibia and fibula are, do you feel any pain there?

P: Uh, yeah, no pain there.

D: OK, and now let's do some um movements with your leg. Um are you sitting down?

P: Uh, yeah, I am.

D: OK, I'm gonna get you to stand up from a sitting position, does that, is that painful?

P: It is, yeah it's, I get a sharp pain if, when doing that. 

D: OK yeah, uhm how about when you um sit back down, does that hurt? 

P: Um yeah, that hurts too.

D: That hurts too, OK. Um and then how about when you flex your knee inwards, um so that your heel is touching your bum like does that hurt? 

P: Uh like I, I'll get up, uh no that doesn't hurt, that feels OK.

D: OK, how about when you extend your knee back out, straighten it all the way?

P: Yeah, that feels OK too if I'm just sitting and doing that, I can um, I can do that OK.

D: OK. Um how about when you, so you're standing and then you uh you abduct your hip so you basically, um you flex your hip but laterally and you kind of bring it upwards so that it's almost, so that your your, the action is like you're uh trying to touch the ceiling.

P: OK yeah I um, it, if, it does feel, it feels like it's kind of pulling um like it feels tight when I do that uh like on that side, it's, I don't get the same sharp pain, but it's uncomfortable.

D: OK, uhm, so I'm gonna try a special test, it's called the Ober test. So can I get you to lie on the side um with the injured knee?

P: Yep.

D: OK, and then I'm gonna get you to flex your knee at 90 degrees and um abduct and extend the hip uh while your thighs maintain in line with your trunk. Um so I'm gonna get you to adduct your thigh, so bring it back towards you, the the median, um as far as possible.

P: Oh yeah, I can't really, it's kind of like stuck out there. It feels really tight if I'm trying to like bring it, bring it back down, my leg almost like floats up if I just leave it there.

D: OK, so that is a positive Ober test. Um OK, so what it sounds like is you, it sounds like you have something called um iliotibial um band syndrome, so ITB syndrome, and basically that happens in um athletes, so depending on your like position, like how much you're using those joints um and like repetitive actions um of like knee flexion extension um kind of triggers that. And to treat it, uh we can try some conservative um things first, so the first thing would be um for you um to have some sort of activity modification to prevent aggravating that joint even more, so you're doing a lot of running, so maybe uh switching to things like swimming um for the time being can help with that. And then other things include ice or heating pads, uh taping and stretching, um and then if the pain is, if the pain uh persists, you can try some like ibuprofen for temporary relief. Um we can talk about other treatments as well, like physiotherapy because um it'll be important to kind of strengthen those muscles around that joint as well as um increase your range of motion, so we can do, we can put in a referral for that. Um and if none of those work, we can also discuss um some other things like ultrasound therapy or like muscle stimulation, um shockwave therapy, and then eventually if none of those other things work, we can discuss surgical management but uh it's rare that it ever gets to that point. Does that sound OK?

P: It does, yeah, thank you so much.

D: OK yeah, no worries.",1031.072625,us_medical,,,,,,,,
RES0147,data/us_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/RES0147.mp3,"D: What can I do for you today?

D: OK, and have you ever had any exposures to any chemicals or any anything that you, any irritants that you think any smoke that might affect your lungs? Or your, yeah. 

P: Uhm, no, I don't think so. I mean, working in the factory environment, I, I'm sure things years ago weren't as clean as they are now, but yeah, I'm not sure.

D: OK, alright. And are you, you said you live alone, are you able to take your things like getting groceries or cooking or cleaning the house or do you need help with that?

P: I I do uh, get some help from my son who lives, who lives nearby, and umm, I able to to get them to to help make some meals and and bring some food over and then I'll go visit them as well. You can take care of the house so and all that not OK on my own, but it certainly gets gets lonely there.

D: I'm sure. What about what about things like walking? Do you use a cane or a walker?

P: Uhm, no, I don't.

D: OK and do you are able to bathe on your own, dress on your own? Do you need help?

P: Oh yeah, those things are OK.

D: OK, have you ever have you been on oxygen at all?

P: No, I haven't, but I feel like I could be right now. It's like, really, I'm short of breath.

D: Yeah, yeah, we can definitely do that here. Uhm, alright. So, given your symptoms, it sounds like maybe you're having a COPD exacerbation, potentially. Do you feel like you might have had contact with anyone who was sick? 

P: Not that I can think of.

D: OK, have you traveled at all, outside the country or outside the province?

P: No, I I've just been helping out at the golf course, but that's all. Kind of outside.

D: Are you wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing?

P: Yeah, we are like, I'm like helping out with cleaning the carts and kind of helping out with the grounds.

D: Mhmm, OK, alright. So we'll do a Covid swab here just in case. And seeing that you're not feeling very well, you might require oxygen, we're going to keep you here in the ER, and we might have to, you might have to be hospitalized. We'll measure your vitals, do a physical exam, do a chest x-ray and you might be having, as I mentioned earlier, in exacerbation, upper COPD or a worsening of your COPD, potentially because you might have an infection, either a viral infection or bacterial infection that can sometimes worsen your COPD symptoms. You might be started on an antibiotic we'll be putting you in oxygen and giving you some steroid some, are you actually about that, are you, are you using any puffers at home?

P: Ah, yeah, so yeah I have been using uh, sorry I I have been using ventolin and there was a daily inhaler, Spiriva, I believe. I've been using that each day.

D: OK great great yeah so we'll be, we'll be giving you some puffers here as well, and yeah, we'll see how things go. Do you have any questions?

RES0048,data/us_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/RES0048.mp3,"D: What brings you in?

P: Yeah, so I just came in because I've been having this cough that's getting worse over the last uh one and a half week and uh, I've also just recently in the last few days been getting some shortness of breath. Um and I also noticed uh my bowel movements have changed a little bit as well over the last week.

D: OK, so yeah, let's break this down. The cough, when did that start?

P: The cough, I think it started uh probably like around 10 days ago.

D: 10 days ago, OK, and how about the shortness of breath?

P: That just started in the last uh I think 3 days.

D: OK, and then the the bowel bowel changes, when did that start? 

P: Yes, I think it also started in like, I would say, for the last three days I've been getting uh diarrhea. 

D: OK OK, so let's go back to the cough, is it constant or um is it triggered by certain things like the cold air, dust, um you know, um, certain times of the day, like morning, evening?

P: Um, I would say it's pretty pretty constant since the last like 10 days, uh it's, there's no real pattern to it, and I've mostly just been inside my house. I don't think there are any triggers or I don't own any pets or anything like that, no new rugs, like uh, no no new changes really in my house.

D: OK, OK and um have you tried anything to make it better?

P: Um, no, not really. I I've done some uh home remedies like trying to do one of those steam steam masks and see if that helps, but it didn't really do anything.

D: OK. Um and how about um the quality of that cough? Is it, does it sound harsh?

P: Um, yeah I would say it's getting a little bit harsh. It's more just like, I'm not bringing anything up, it's more like a dry cough um, but yeah, I would say it's getting worse, definitely.

D: OK. Um, is it a dry cough then, or are you producing a little bit of sputum or blood or anything like that?

P: No, no, I haven't seen any blood at all and rarely do I bring like up some sputum, but like most of the time it's just a dry cough.

D: OK, it's a dry cough. Um and would you say the cough's getting worse?

P: Yeah, I'd definitely say in the last um three to four days I've been just coughing nonstop, it's very irritating. 

D: Yeah, have you experienced anything like this before?

P: Um, probably a few years ago, I think I caught the flu or something and got really sick with a fever and just a lot of coughing. But since then, nothing else. 

D: OK. Um the shortness of breath, 1 to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is it?

P: Uh probably like a five. It kind of just started out with uh, three days ago, was kind of like I just
couldn't take deep breaths like I noticed that my breathing was getting a little bit more more shallow and now it's, especially when I'm coughing, it's like I really have to sit down and catch my breath.

D: Yeah, um does anything make the shortness of breath worse? Like I guess um you know exertion, uh laying down, anything like that?

P: Um, not really. Maybe like sitting down helps sometimes, but even when I'm sitting down I'm still coughing. 

D: OK. OK and um do you have any wheeziness?

P: No, I don't think so. 

D: OK, any chest pain?

P: Um, maybe from all the coughing, sometimes I feel like there's some pain there, but it's not not anything that's too painful.

D: OK, um do you feel like your heart's racing at all?

P: Uh no, not really. 

D: OK. Um have you noticed any swelling in your limbs?

P: No, I didn't notice anything like that.

D: OK, how about um pain in your calves when you walk a few blocks?

P: No, I've been fine that way. 

D: OK. Dizziness or fainting spells?

P: Uh no, not really, I I thought maybe with the shortness of breath that would happen, but like so far that hasn't happened to me.

P: OK, any fevers or chills?

D: Uh no I, maybe like a few chills, like I'm not sure actually, it was hard to tell, but I haven't had any fevers.

P: OK, we'll take your temperature today just to make sure. Um any weight loss over the past few weeks?

D: Uh no, probably weight gain.

P: OK, any changes in your hair, nails, or skin, like rashes? 

P: Uh, no, I haven't noticed anything like that.

D: OK, any changes in your vision or hearing?

P: Uh no, no, that that's all been fine.

D: How about um loss of smell or taste?

P: No, I haven't had uh, I think my taste and smell are still pretty good. No, no issues there.

D: OK, um have you had a runny nose or stuffy nose?

P: No, no, no no congestion really.

D: OK, and um have you had a sore throat at all?

P: No, no sore throat. 

D: OK. Um any issues swallowing food?

P: No.

D: No, changes in your appetite?

P: Maybe just a little bit, like I don't really feel like eating when I'm coughing all the time, but other than that, no, not really.

D: OK. How about nausea or vomiting?

P: No, nothing like that.

D: OK um constipation?

P: No, diarrhea.

D: Diarrhea, right. Um how often are you having a bowel movement right now?

P: I would say uh like I've been going, probably more than eight times a day, probably in the last few days like 10 times a day.

D: Oh wow, OK, and each time are you producing a lot of stool, or is it just a little bit each time?

P: Like a little bit, but it's mostly liquidy.

D: OK. Any solids at all? Like is it semi solid at all?

P: Um maybe a little bit, but mostly it's just liquid.

D: OK, um any blood in the stool?

P: No, I've been checking uh no, I didn't notice any blood or change in colour. It's mainly just um liquid diarrhea.

D: OK, any changes in your urine? 

P: No.

D: No, OK, um any confusion or memory loss?

P: No, not that I know of.

D: OK, um how about muscle aches or joint pains?

P: No, nothing like that.

D: OK, and are you otherwise healthy or do you have any long uh standing medical conditions?

P: Uh, so I do have diabetes and high blood pressure.

D: OK, do you take any medications for those conditions?

P: Yeah, so for diabetes I'm taking this medication called uh like I think metformin and then for the blood pressure, uh I think it's, I forgot the name, I think it's something like um ramipril or something like that.

D: Yep, OK, and you're taking that um as directed, right?

P: Yeah, I've been taking that regularly and my blood pressure, I've been measuring, it's been pretty steady, no changes. 

D: OK, that's good. Have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?

P: I did have my appendix removed, probably in my 20s, but uh that was the only thing. 

D: OK, um and do you have any allergies?

P: No, not not really.

D: OK. Are you up to date with all your immunizations?

P: Yep.

D: OK. Are you on any other medications besides the ramipril and metformin?

P: Just uh like multi vitamins for men over 50.

D: OK, OK. Um any family history of heart conditions or lung conditions that you know of?

P: Um yeah, so my family, like diabetes is pretty big, it runs in the family and uh my father in his 60s uh like died from a heart attack. Um other than that, not anything else I can think of, no.

D: OK, any cancers in their family?

P: Uh no, I don't think so.

D: OK, do you smoke?

P: I used to, I I quit probably five years ago, but before that I used to smoke probably a pack a day for more than 20 years.

D: Oh OK, well good job for cutting down and quitting, um.

P: Yeah.

D: Yeah, um do you do marijuana at all?

P: No, no no no drugs.

D: Any other recreational drugs? You said no, right?

P: Yeah no, no, I don't do any drugs.

D: OK, um do you drink alcohol?

P: Yeah, I probably have maybe um some whiskey maybe a couple times a week.

D: OK. Um and where do you live right now?

P: Uh, so yeah, I just live in the city in London uh in an apartment with my, just wife, my wife.

D: OK, um is she also sick or is she OK?

P: No, she's been completely fine, and I've been kind of isolating myself from her over the last week.

D: OK, well that's good and that's smart, um just because you don't know what you have, right?

P: Mhmm.

D: Yeah OK, do, can you think of any other sick contacts that you may have had over the past one or two weeks or even three weeks?

P: Um I go to the grocery store, then I go to work, I haven't noticed anyone being sick at work, but you know, you never know like who comes in asymptomatic and like they might be carrying it, with this
virus like mainly I'm worried about covid and you know just how fast that's spreading everywhere.

D: Yeah, for sure. Um yeah, for sure, have you traveled to anywhere recently?

P: No, uh we've been in Canada, Ontario, haven't left to go anywhere.

D: OK. OK, well those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or did you have any concerns, anything that you wanted to discuss today?

P: Yeah no, I just uh was wondering if I can get the covid test, that would just, I wanted to make sure I don't give anyone covid if I do have it. 

D: Yeah, for sure, I think that's a good idea. Um so, and it's definitely something that we need to rule out, so we'll do a covid swab today um and you'll hear back within 24 to 48 hours, um but in the mean time, regardless of whether you actually have covid or not, because your symptoms overlap with covid, um it's good to isolate for 14 days and that includes trying to isolate from your wife as well if possible, and public health should be in touch if it's positive uh to do contact tracing. Um and if it's not covid, it's probably another viral illness that's going around at this time of year. Uh if your symptoms get worse, um you know you're having neurological symptoms or or if your fever gets really high, or you're having a lot of trouble breathing, then you should go see the ER. How does that sound?

P: My, if my breathing gets worse uh I'll just go to the emergency Department?

D: Yes, please do. 

P: OK, sounds good.

D: Alright, take care. 

P: You too, thank you.",905.3701875,us_medical,,,,,,,,

P: No about what day is it today? Today is Wednesday. It started on Sunday, Sunday. I noticed it getting really bad.

D: OK, so it got really bad. Then it was it was it still present but not as bad before that?

P: Yeah I think I had like a bit of like a raspy cough on like Friday but Sunday it was when I started getting nervous about it.

D: OK so almost a week, it sounds like. And what exactly changed on Sunday that you made it worse in your opinion?

P: So Sunday I started bringing I noticed like little spots of red kind of the the gunk I was bringing up.

D: OK. 

P: And I kind of ignored it, but the next day they were still there. I started getting fever just in I felt off, you know.

D: OK. OK, so that you first notice that on Sunday, were you bringing up sputum before that and it just didn't have these spots or did it, did that part just start on Sunday?

P: Sputum is kind of like the gunk up and bring it up? Yeah, it was. It's like this yellow custard, it’s got like well spots are red on it on Sunday.

D: OK, and before that did you have like the yellow custard without red? Or it all started at once all kind of started?

P: It all started at once to be honest.

D: Sorry, I know these are tricky questions, and you said that you've had some fevers. Can you tell me a little bit about that? When did that start?

P: So that started, the Monday really is when I first started. I never took my temperature. I just felt hot. You know that's been going on pretty much until today.

D: OK, did you ever feel like you were really shaky?

P: Yeah, I've been getting the chills, especially last two days. 

D: OK. So over this time you've had this cough, have you felt like you've had difficulty breathing?

P: Not really, I feel a little bit winded doing things. I used to do like I take the stairs up to my apartment, but I have just happened really trying to exert myself that's been taking it easy so I haven't really noticed being out of breath.

D: OK, so probably if you were to get up and do a lot of physical activity you would feel worse.

P: Yeah, I could, probably I can still take the two stairs up to my apartment, but after that I started to feel pretty crummy.

D: OK. Is there anything else that you can think of that makes it feel worse?

P: No. 

D: Has anything helped it to feel better at all? 

P: Bringing up gunk makes it feel better for a little while.

D: So you kind of just clear it up and that feels a little bit better?

P: Yeah, I haven't taken some Tylenol at home and that helps a little bit. 

D: OK, have you felt a sore throat at the same time?

P: After an awful lot of coughing, yeah, it starts to feel a little raw.

D: Have you had a runny nose?

P: Yeah, bit of 1 back in the day, maybe a week ago, but that kind of gone away by now.

D: Have you felt any chest pain? 

P: Yeah. Yeah I got pain kinda on the right.

D: OK. Have you ever have you ever had anything like this before?

P: No never. Actually Doc, you're saying something that makes it feel worse? Taking a deep breath makes it feel pretty bad.

D: OK, and. I'm just going to circle back to this chest pain. You said you feel it on the right side. Is it always there or is it just when you take a deep breath or is it kind of on and off?

P: It's kind of always there. It gets a little bit worse with coughing and when I take a pretty big deep breath.

D: Yeah, OK, but if you were just laying down, not coughing, is that pain there?

P: Yeah yeah, specially notice over the last day, 

D: OK.

P: Kind of dull.

D: OK. And have you had any weight loss recently? 

P: No, not really.

D: K. Have you traveled anywhere recently?

P: Went to Sarnia. About a week back for work but.

D: OK, were you in contact with anyone that that was sick?

P: Nope, just been keeping to myself mostly.

D: OK, so in terms of your own medical history, do you have any chronic conditions that you see your family doctor for regularly?

P: Yeah, he’s given me a pill for a cholesterol.

D: OK. And do you know the names of any medications that you take?

P: Lipitor. 

D: OK is that the only one?

P: Yeah 

D: OK. Have you ever had any surgeries?

P: Uh, my wisdom teeth out as a as a kid. 15 or so I think. 

D: OK. Do you have any allergies? 

P: No.

D: I’m just going to ask you a few questions about your lifestyle and like do you live here in town?

P: Yeah, I live here in town, got a girlfriend living in apartment.

D: OK, you live with your girlfriend, 

P: Yeah.

D: Do you have any pets?

P: Cat, yeah. 

D: Do you do anything for work or are you retired?

P: Yeah, I still work a consultant for the chemical plant, so West. Mainly in Sarnia.

D: So have you had a lot of exposure to chemicals throughout your career?

P: Now they've always been pretty good for keeping us safe. I'm on the engineering side of things, so I don't really work too much in the plant directly. You know, 

D: OK. Here, well, do you drink alcohol?

P: Once in a blue moon. 

D: Do you smoke?

P: Yeah.

D: How much would you say that you smoke?

P: Got a pack a day. 

D: Long is that been going on for? 

P: Geez, must have picked it up when I was 15. 

D: OK. Do you use any other substances?

P:  Like drugs?

D: Yeah, cannabis or any other recreational drugs. 

P: Smoke the odd joint from time to time, but haven't in years now.

D: Do you have any family history of any respiratory illnesses?

P: Respiratory illness, like lungs?

P: Yeah, I've been having all my immunizations. Uh, I also feel like, so with a sore throat, I also have some um, pain on the sides, like on my, on my neck. Like I almost feel like some lumps on both sides.

D: Oh, I see, I see. Okay, okay. Um, so I guess I, at this point I would like to maybe have it, examine you, just have a look inside your throat, maybe feel your neck for those lumps, and uh, then decide what to do from there. Um, given your symptoms, um, this could be a viral infection, or um, it could be a bacterial infection caused by um, bacteria called, or I guess, strep, strep throat. It could also be uh, mono. Um, but I'll uh, I'll have a look, we'll do the rapid strep test and uh, based on those results, we'll decide what to do. If it is strep, you might require antibiotics. If not, if it's mono and if we can do maybe a blood test for that, you might have to um, not engage in, in physical activity um, or exercise, vigorous activity, or like sports for the next couple of weeks or months as, as that can be, uh, as that can cause problems if you get hit in the, in your belly. It could cause your spleen to rupture and sometimes your spleen become very big if you do have mono, but we'll discuss all of that a little bit more after we do uh, the strep test. We'll also check your temperature, um, and see um, how you're doing. Have you been taking anything to help yourself, to help soothe your sore throat?

P: Um, just some lozenges.

D: Yeah, so just continue uh, just drinking water and taking lozenges just to um, provide some comfort for yourself, and we'll do the test, then we can chat a bit more after.

P: Uh no, I don't think so. Is it, when you asked me if my neck was swollen, my necks not swollen but I feel like inside the back of my throat, my tonsils feel a little bit swollen.

D: OK. And have you looked? Does it look like you have like redness in the back of your, back of your mouth?

P: Yeah, it looks pretty red and angry.

D: OK, and it's sore?

P: Yeah.

D: OK, so it's just to kind of summarize, this happens like this sometimes you been having so the sore throat, like the redness and swelling of the tonsils in the back of your mouth, as well as a fever and being pretty tired over these last few days.

P: Yes.

D: OK, yeah. Um alright, so it's sounding like most likely this would be strep throat or, or Group A strep pharyngitis with, because you have no cough, and with a high fever and swelling that you've been redness that you notice in the back of your mouth. And so we'll do a rapid strep antigen test and it will require just a throat swab. To see, to to detect for that, however with a, uh, umm, yeah, I guess that's it. That's what I yeah, well, we'll start with with that now and it could potentially be something like uhm, a viral illness, but that's lower on the on the differential then the bacterial infection is right now. And because of COVID it will be, we'll do a swab as well because people can get fever and sore throat with with COVID as well. 

P: Ok.

D: So just to make sure that we're being comprehensive.

P: OK. That sounds good. Thank you so much.

D: OK, OK. Um has he tried anything for it? Have you given him any over the counter medications?

P: Yeah, we we did use some Tylenol and it brought the fever down so that was part of the reason why we we didn't come in 'cause he's had sore throats before but the fever bounced back and and the pain seems to have continued so we came in. 

D: Ok, OK. And is he otherwise healthy? Does he have any medical conditions?

P: Uh, yeah, he's otherwise healthy no medical conditions, um hasn't been, had a reason to see a doctor before.

D: OK, OK Um alright, so it sounds like, um grom what you're telling me, he ohh sorry, I should have asked you this earlier. Has he had any issues breathing?

P: Um no problems breathing, but his voice does sound a bit, a little bit off. A bit Husky. 

D: A bit Husky, OK. Um alright and nothing like a seizure like a febrile seizure, right?

P: No, I haven't seen any like limb jerking or anything like that.

D: OK, so um, just roughly doing from the sounds of it, it sounds like he has a sore throat that's been persistent and we do this thing called the Centor score. So it sounds like he's had a fever, no cough, a sore throat. So the first thing that we want to check to see or to rule out would be a strep throat and then well if that comes back negative we will go from there and think about other viral causes versus strep throat as well. 

D: Did you have any questions or anything that I missed that you wanted to discuss today?

P: Um, no. We were thinking that it could be, uh, maybe strep throat. So um, yeah, thank you.

P: Uh, I did have a couple of ear infections when I was, when I was younger, but I haven't had any since.

D: OK. And no pneumonia or anything like that, right? 

P: No, nothing like that.

D: OK. Uhm, any history of asthma or eczema or allergic rhinitis?

P: No, I haven't heard of those before.

D: Alright. Are you taking any medications?

P: No, I'm not.

D: Were you given any antibiotics six months ago when you had your tonsillitis?

P: I was yeah, I think I, I think a like amoxicillin.

D: Right and uh, do you have allergies to food or environmental allergies or allergies to any medications?

P: Yeah I, I have allergies to peanuts.

D: What happens? 

P: Yeah, I do get anaphylaxis from it. I've uhm, or I'll get yeah like hives and throat swelling. And so I do carry an EpiPen, I haven't had to use it though. 

D: Yeah, that's good, that's good. And so couple questions about, uhm, I guess more general questions, do you, who do you live with and where do you live, in a house or an apartment?

P: Live in a house with uhm, with my parents and older sister. 

D: OK, and uhm, are you, uhm, are you currently smoking or have you ever smoked in the past?

P: No.

D: OK. Also I just want to remind you that these questions will remain confidential between you and me. In case you're worried, no one's going to find out about what we're talking about unless you, unless there's concern about harm to you or harm to anyone else. Do you feel safe at home? 

P: I do, yes.

D: OK, are things going well at school? Any bullying? Are you happy with your grades?

P: Yeah there everything I, I mean school is school, but it's been good.

D: OK, and you said you don't smoke. Have you tried any other any recreational drugs? Any marijuana?

P: No, I haven't.

D: OK, any alcohol?

P: No.

D: OK. And are you so sexually active?

P: No, I'm not.

D: OK. Uhm, alright, have you had contact with anyone who might be sick?

P: I don't think so. I mean, going to, we both I mean, we've been going back to school recently, but nobody's been off.

D: OK. So you've been doing schooling in person, then, OK.

P: Yeah. 

D: Alright. Any medical conditions that run in your family, anything related to the lungs, or otherwise?

P: Uh, no.

D: OK, uhm, alright, well those are all the questions I had for you. So it sounds like last week you had itchy eyes runny nose, you were sneezing and you had a dry cough. And then over time some of those symptoms resolved and you continued to have a cough that was also getting better, but you then developed a sore throat. And you have been feeling feverish over the past two days. Did you measure, did you check your temperature last week?

P: I didn't check it last week, but I checked it yesterday and it was 38.2, I think. 

D: OK.

P: But yeah, but but those are the symptoms that that I've been having.

D: Uhm, so it sounds like you your symptoms have evolved quite a bit over the past two weeks. It could have, it could be potentially that you had a viral infection initially and might you might have like a superimposed bacterial infection, but we don't know that for sure. Uhm, we, we'll do a physical exam. Have a listen to your chest, have a look inside your mouth, look at your throat. Uhm, we, uhm, I guess the original symptoms you had last week., uhm, were seem a little bit different. It could be pharyngitis, maybe what you have right now could potentially be pharyngitis with a sore throat and the fever that you've developed over the past three or four days. So, I'll definitely have a look inside your throat as well, and if necessary we could do a rapid strep test. Uhm, and we would also have to do a Covid test just in case, and I would recommend that you quarantine at home. The results should come out in the next 12 to 20 for 24 to 48 hours. Just self isolate, stay away from other family members and then you'll find out the results. If it's positive, someone will call you from public health and then let you know what to do.

P: OK, yeah, that sounds good.

D: Alright.

P: Thank you.

D: Yeah, you're welcome.",711.3874375,us_medical,,,,,,,,
RES0055,data/us_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/RES0055.mp3,"D: What brings you in?

P: Hi, yes I just came in today because I've been a bit concerned about some breathing difficulties over the last few days. It all started out with like a cough over the last week, but now I'm having trouble breathing as well.

D: Oh OK, well I'm sorry to hear that. So you said a cough as well, so the cough at least a week back and the shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, when did that start? 

P: So yeah, the cough, I usually have a cough. I've had COPD for a long time, but this past week the coughing has been much worse with a lot of more sputum and. Other than that, it started I would say two to three days ago. The cough got worse and then every time I'm moving around I like have to sit down and catch my breath, which is pretty abnormal for me.

D: OK yeah, so alright. So let's focus on the cough first. You said it's a wet cough?

P: Yes, I am producing a lot of sputum. 

D: OK, what color is your sputum?

P: It's mainly like clear white.

D: OK yeah so you don't see yellow pus or anything green or bloody in there?

P: No, I don't think so. But there's definitely like a lot more than what I usually produce.

D: OK, umm this cough, does it sound harsh, barky or does it sound muffled?

P: I would say it's a bit harsh at times. I wouldn't say it's barky or muffled. I do find myself wheezing a little over the last few days as well. 

D: OK. Do you find you have any chest pain associated with the shortness of breath?

P: Oh no, I don't really have any pains.

D: OK, and have you ever experienced anything like this before?

P: I did a couple of years ago, I had to be admitted because I had some shortness of breath. 

D: OK.

P: But that was, I think, two years ago. 

D: OK. And when you were admitted two years ago, did they tell you what you had?

P: Yeah, they said I had some kind of lung infection at that time, so they gave me some antibiotics while I was in the hospital.

D: OK, did they ever say to you that you had anything else like asthma, COPD, any longstanding conditions?

P: Yeah so I've had COPD for more than... I guess more than 10 years now so I think it just got a lot worse with the infection.

D: OK yeah alright. So this time around, have you had any fevers?

P: I've been having a couple of chills but like they would come and go. I didn't really think it was a fever.

D: OK, any weight loss?

P: No.

D: OK, how about changes in your hair or nails like or or skin like rashes? 

P: Umm, no. 

D: Any changes in your vision or hearing?

P: Nope. 

D: And how about smell or taste?

P: Umm, no. I think they're the same. 

D: OK. Have a stuffy nose or runny nose?

P: I do feel a bit stuffy, but it's not too bad. 

D: OK. And any swelling in your in your legs or upper limbs?

P: No, not that I know.

D: How about calf pain? 

P: Nope.

D: Dizziness or fainting spells?

P: No. 

D: Headaches?

P: No headaches. 

D: Memory loss or confusion?

P: Nope.

D: Changes in your bowel movement or abdominal pain?

P: Nope. 

D: Changes to urinating?

P: No, that's all fine 

D: OK, so besides the COPD, do you have any other longstanding conditions?

P: I do have some high blood pressure which I take, I think I take one of these medications called metoprolol. 

D: OK, and when was the last time you had your blood pressure checked?

P: Umm, probably like a month ago and it was pretty good. I've been checking by myself at home too and it hasn't been changing too much. I think the last one I took was probably like 135 / 80.

D: Oh, I see. OK, any hospitalizations besides the one that you had for COPD a year back?

P: Umm, back when I was a kid I had my tonsils removed.

D: OK, are you on any medications besides the metoprolol? 

P: I do take multivitamins.I think that's yeah, that's about it.

D: Do you take any puffers for your COPD?

P: Yeah, so I do have three like different puffers I take. I can't remember the name. I do have some puffers I don't take. I've been using them right now. It has been helping with some of my shortness of breath, but I've definitely been having to use them way more than I used to.

D: OK. Do you know which puffer you're on?

P: Yeah, so I think one of them is called ventolin. OK, and then I think the second one is called the Spiriva.

D: OK, sure, Yep.

P: So one of them should be a short acting beta agonist.

D: Just wanna make sure that you have one with a long acting and then the other one is a long acting beta agonist. OK, good. Alright, are you up to date with all your immunizations?

P: Yeah, I think so.

D: And are you allergic to anything?

P: No, not that I know.

D: Any family history of lung conditions?

P: Umm, no I don't think so. Yeah, no, I don't think so.

D: OK. How about heart conditions?

P: Yeah, my father died of a heart attack in his 60s. 

D: OK. Alright, any cancers?

P: My uncle had skin cancer. 

D: OK. Do you know what type of skin cancer like melanoma, basal cell, squamous cell?

P: No, I think it wasn't the bad one. It was like the one they can remove right away.

D: Oh I see. OK, OK, that's good.Do you smoke?

P: Yeah, I've been smoking for around, I would say the last 20 years.

D: OK, how much do you smoke?

P: Probably I would say pack a day for the last 20 years.

D: Umm, have you ever thought about quitting?

P: Yeah I did. I did once and then went back onto it. I definitely do smoke less than before though. OK, but yeah, I don't think I'm ready to quit yet.

D: OK, yeah no problem. Do you drink alcohol? 

P: Umm, yeah, maybe once a week I would have a small Cup of whiskey.

D: OK, sure, that's fine. And any other drugs?

P: No, no marijuana, no other drugs.

D: OK, and where do you live right now?

P: Right now I live in a small bungalow in London. 

D: OK, any reasons to believe there are carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, anything that could be triggering your COPD?

P: Umm, I don't think so. Everything is pretty up to date.

D: OK, have you had any contact with anyone that's been sick recently?

P: No, I've been mostly trying to isolate and like just be in my own home. 

D: OK, how about travel to anywhere?

P: Nope, I've been in Ontario since the beginning of the pandemic.

D: Yeah OK, that makes sense. Well, those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?

P: Yeah, I was just worried if it can be COVID or if it's just like another infection that I had like before.

D: Yeah, so we're definitely going to do a COVID swab on you and those results should take about 24 to 48 hours to come back to you. And in the meantime, because your symptoms do overlap with COVID, you should isolate for 14 days. Public health will be in touch with you if it's positive to do some contact tracing. If it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection that's been going around during this time of year which is likely because you have COPD, since you're already coughing more than you usually are and seeing more sputum. We will reassess to see whether your puffers are working. If we need to add any additional things like inhaled corticosteroids as well as antibiotics and so just keep an eye on your symptoms for now and will also want to do probably a chest X Ray and possibly a pulmonary function test. How does that sound?

P: Thank you.

RES0170,data/us_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/RES0170.mp3,"D: How may I help you today?

P: I'm just bringing my son today because he's been how many episodes where I'm eat hell gets all this coughing fit and become wheezy and become shorter breath and I mean after a period of time it goes away, but it's been happening every so often.

D: Does he still have these symptoms?

P: Like right now he's OK. When the symptoms come on, they last for I don't know, maybe 30 minutes, 60 minutes or or even less. But yeah it happens maybe once or twice a week where and it's been going on for a, a couple of months now. Yeah, he actually had a viral infection like a few months ago and I thought it was just that. It leared up and then he's just had a few more of these episodes, but without those kind of symptoms so.

D: Hm? So all this started a couple months ago.

P: Yeah. 

D: Do you find that there and you mentioned that it happens about one to two times a week? Is there anything specific happening at that time? Any triggers that result in these symptoms?

P: Well I will say I think I like exercise. I find yeah like soccer practice. Yeah, after maybe, or even during a game, like when things are really intense. Yeah, I think during soccer I've I've kind of noticed it. And then at night time as well. It kind of randomly, he'll have this cough.

D: OK. So I guess it's do you feel like it's affected by cold weather as well or no?

P: Um, maybe yeah, like if he yeah completely in the winter time. Like I know when he goes outside if he yeah he takes like a deep breath or something like that. He'll talk about having shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in the cold weather. 

D: OK, other than the and I guess the cough. Is he coughing up anything, or is it kind of a dry cough?

P: It's dry.

D: OK. Does he have any like chest pain during these episodes.

P: No, he hasn't said anything like that.

D: Alright, any fevers?

P: No, he had a little bit of a fever at the that one time a few months ago, but he hasn't. So that's right. I think he had a some sort of illness then, but he hasn't had any fevers.

D: I see. OK, any headaches?

P: No, he hasn't said anything like that. 

D: OK. And how has he had any other symptoms so anything like racing heart or belly pain or muscle aches or any changes in his bowel movements or urinary symptoms? 

P: Uh no, I haven't heard him, uh, I complain about anything like that. I think I'll everything like that's been normal. 

D: OK. So when he has these episodes, how like how severe are they? So how difficult is it for him to breathe?

P: Ah, well, you certainly when it first starts, I mean for the first minute or two. Yeah, he that when I think particularly at soccer practice school have a really hard time catching his breath, but like he would, he stops playing and rests and really tries to make sure that he is I don't know, just trying to to breathe and it kind of goes away. He's been able to manage it OK.

D: OK, alright and I have these symptoms that have interfered with his daily activities? Does he for instance, try to avoid soccer practice. Or does he have difficulties falling asleep at night?

P: Yeah, definitely wakes him up a few and every once in awhile at night and he does have to take it a little easier at soccer for sure. So yeah, I am thinking it is affecting him.

D: OK. And otherwise has he been, has he had any medical conditions that he's been diagnosed with?

P: Uh, no, well he had some rashes when he was younger that he would get some some creams for, but that's mostly resolved now.

D: OK, any hospitalizations or surgeries?

P: No, he hasn't had anything like that.

D: OK, uhm. And just going back to his birth and your pregnancy, were there any complications at the time of pregnancy? 

P: Um, there was a prolonged labor, I think, but he was delivered vaginally and at term 

D: OK. OK, that's great.

P: And he, oh sorry, I was just going to say normal weight as well. 

D: OK good has, was he kept in the in ICU for a couple of days after, was he sent home?

P: I think they, like he was kept for not an ICU he was kept for one day I think so just monitor for infection because it was like prolonged labor but he was OK. OK, so yeah we were able to go home.

D: OK, and I, what was I going to say. Forgot what I was going to say. How yeah, how has this growth and development been? Has he been seeing his doctor regularly? Any concerns there? 

P: Yeah he's been good with with growth. No concerns for that and his developments been normal as well. He's reached all of his milestones.

D: OK, and is he going to school?

P: Yeah, yeah, he's been going to school. He hasn't really been, he hasn't missed well he's missed one or two days actually, because of the cough, like on nights that he just didn't sleep well, so in the morning he's just well, not not feeling good for school so he has missed a couple of days over the last few months.

D: Okay. And does he, is there any other any conditions that run in the family? Including things like asthma or eczema, or allergic rhinitis or allergies.

P: Yeah, sister does have some bad allergies. Her nose runs all the time and she also has that asthma. His sister uses and a daily inhaler and then also W1. 

D: I see. OK, and uh. How are things at home is he, is he doing well otherwise? Like at school and things like that, any stressors in his life?

P: No, he's been doing, uh, he's been doing well at school. He likes math and that that's been going, well. 

D: OK, great. Has he ever tried any puffers?

P: No, he hasn't actually. 

D: Has he been on any medications?

P: Um, he he has not. 

D: Any allergies that he has?

P: Not that I'm aware of, but I I think he might. I mean so like environmental or I don't know, something. He does get symptoms like a runny nose and itchy eyes sometimes, but usually go away pretty pretty quickly and he doesn't fuss about it too much so, yeah so. 

D: From the symptoms that you've described so far, it sounds like he might also have asthma, but we will obviously have to do some testing and confirm that. Uhm, and also, it's given sort of the results, or even just like giving his symptoms, prescribe some buffers to help with those symptoms. Clearly it's affecting his life. He can't go to school or can't participate in soccer, or sometimes wakes up in the middle of the night, and that's not good. So, we'll we can be prescribed some puffers and see if those help and also get some testing done. Do you have any other questions for me? 

P: Uhm, No, yeah I was just wondering about, so like the wheezing and all of that could be with from asthma too?

D: Uhm, yeah, I would think so, but again, we'll get the testing done and see if there are any other, any other causes.

P: Ok.

D: You said the wheezing sort of lasts only 30 to 30 minutes to an hour and then gets better?

P: Yeah, I don't notice that any other times.

D: Yes, it's possibly, I mean, I would think it's asthma, but then we'll get the testing done and see.

RES0216,data/us_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/RES0216.mp3,"D: So I understand you're having some chest tightness?

P: Yeah, it's uh, for the last maybe three days, um it's not really pain, not in any specific spot, it just feels a bit tight in my chest area when I breathe in especially, and it just gets a bit harder to breathe and it feels more tight like especially when I go for my walks, which I do everyday, uh I try to walk my dog. So I was just, you know, worried that it could be something serious and I wanted to come and get checked out.

D: OK, for sure. So you said it started about 3 days ago. Have you noticed it's been getting better, worse or about staying the same?

P: I think it's staying the same.

D: OK, was there anything that happened 3 days ago that you can recall where you first noticed it?

P: No, nothing in particular um yeah, it just kind of came on and now it's been pretty steady.

D: OK and when it came on three days ago, what were you doing?

P: Uh I think I first noticed it when I was gone for my walk.

D: OK, now when you're walking, you say you have some chest tightness, do you have any chest pain? 

P: No, there's not there's not pain, it just feels like, when I breathe in it feels tight.

D: OK, did you feel anxious or sweaty or the feeling of impending doom at all? 

P: Uh, no I can't say that I did.

D: Nothing like that, OK, and did you feel yourself becoming out of breath at all?

P: Uh I I feel like it was kind of harder to get a whole breath, um so yeah, yeah, I guess.

D: OK, and was this tightness all across your chest or was it in one particular area?

P: Kind of just all over. 

D: OK. And since then, that happened when you were out for a walk, how many times does it happen a day would you say? 

P: Well, I feel like it's kind of always there, but it gets worse when I go for my walk. Um and well sometimes I go for more than one walk, right, 'cause I walk my dog. It's always kind of there, and especially when I'm like getting up out of the chair, I can feel it more, or when I take a big like a big breath in, as I said.

D: OK, so it's been there pretty constantly for the past three days, but it's more noticeable, if not worse, when you're going for a walk?

P: Exactly.

D: OK. Have you had any cough at all in the last little while?

P: Uh no like I feel a little more hoarse and like there's maybe some more phlegm, like I'm clearing my throat more, but I haven't actually been coughing.

D: OK, any fevers? 

P: No, can't say that, no.

D: OK, any night sweats, so waking up and the sheets are soaked?

P: No.

D: Any chills?

P: No.

D: Any unexplained weight loss at all?

P: Nope.

D: OK, and have you ever had anything like this happen to you before?

P: Uhm, I mean I have asthma um so I've had some trouble breathing before, it, this feels feels uh different than other times. I I guess it could be related, but uh I don't know, this this feels a bit different, that's why I wanted to come in and get it checked out.

D: OK, so you have asthma, do you use any puffers at the moment?

P: Yeah, I just use the one that um I take every day. I don't really use the uhm, the one thats as needed because I just haven't had to in a really long time so I didn't refill my last one.

D: OK, so you don't have any anymore of the as needed, but you have used it in the past?

P: Yeah, exactly like it's been a couple of years since I needed that, but I still I still take the daily one.

D: OK. And you haven't stopped taking the daily one in last three days either?

P: No, I always take it um so I'm supposed to actually take it morning and night, um for a while though sometimes I was skipping the night one because I didn't feel that I was needing it. Um so so lately I've been taking it everyday, but I've just been taking it in the morning.

D: OK, uh, what makes you say you haven't really needed the one at night? Have you just been doing well without it?

P: Exactly, like I haven't needed the rescue one in a few years and even when I was just taking it in the morning, I I haven't had any problems.

D: OK, understood. And then have you had, I should have asked, do you work currently?

P: Uh I I, I'm a financial advisor, I'm like semi retired so I do some stuff from home.

D: OK, got it. I suppose just, has this kind of chest tightness stopped you from doing activities that you normally would do, any missed time from work?

P: I haven't missed any work, but I'm not I'm not doing a ton of work right now. I don't think it would stop me, it just would make me uncomfortable um during work and it keeps me, maybe this, the last few days, it's kept me from, I usually go on a couple of walks a day, the last couple days I've just gone on one usually so yeah, it's a little bit, yeah.

D: So it's really not stopping too much of your day to day functioning, but it's noticeable?

P: Exactly, yeah.

D: OK. Now, is there any other issue that you see your doctor regularly for aside from the asthma?

P: Uhm, I have uh high blood pressure, I don't really see my doctor very much, I just am on um medication.

D: OK, how about we just talk about your medications a little bit? What are you taking currently?

P: Uh I take the, uh, salbutamol.

D: Yeah.

P: That we talked about, and I take um Ramipril.

D: Yep.

P: And, uh, sometimes a Tylenol if you know, if I have a headache or something, but not very often.

D: OK understood, so aside from the high blood pressure you're really not taking medications for much else?

P: No, no.

D: OK. Do you have any other lung issues or any trouble with your lungs in the past?

P: No, nothing major, just the asthma. But you know, like I said, it's been a few years since it has bothered me.

D: OK, got it, and just in terms of your life itself, so do you smoke at all?

P: No, never.

D: OK, so no smoking, any other recreational substances, drugs?

P: Oh no, no. I mean I I have um you know a few beers on the weekend, but I don't do very, I don't do any drugs and I don't drink much other than that.

D: OK, got it. Any allergies that you have?

P: Uhm no, no, like I, uh, when I was younger I got some seasonal allergies sometimes in the springtime, but other than that, I I like I, it's really been uh many years since I've noticed that.

D: OK, and so nothing new in the environment? You haven't changed where you've been living or you haven't introduced a new pet or a new dog?

P: Exactly.

D: OK, so sounds like you're pretty much staying the course last little while, just kind of a new onset of this new chest tightness, and aside from that, seems that it comes on mainly on walks outdoors, but you've kind of been limiting the, some of the medication you're taking for asthma the last couple of years because you haven't really felt that you needed it as much. 

P: Yeah, like just the morning was, it was enough.

D: OK. Alright John, I think I've got most of the information I need just to go talk to the doc and talk about your story. Next of course we're going to do a quick physical exam, going to take a listen to your lungs and see what else we might want to do in terms of investigations. I have a feeling that this actually might be your asthma reoccurring in some capacity or that would be on the top of the differential for now, barring any other new findings. So I think maybe what we would like to do is, we'd like to try having those rescue puffers available to see if that helps at all when you are on walks, and if they don't help, then we'll come back to the table and see what other possible directions we could head in in order to help you next. Does that sound good John?

P: Sounds great, I'm just, you know, glad to know that it's probably not my heart.

D: No, it sounds well, I suppose you said that you didn't really get out of breath with exercise, more sounds like a chest tightness, and you haven't had any pain associated with it, so that puts more cardiac ischemic pictures kind of lower on the differential. But of course we're going to try one thing at a time, and then we'll come back to the table um depending on how you're feeling after that, OK?

P: Sounds great, thank you.

D: No problem. OK, I'll go talk to the doctor, I'll be back with you in a moment.

P: Thank you.",627.647125,us_medical,,,,,,,,

P: No.

D: OK, and how about any cancers that run in the family?

P: No cancers that I know of.

D: OK, and how about heart conditions or or lung conditions?

P: No, nothing like that. 

D: OK, so next. Just wanted to move on to their physical exam piece of the appointment today, so just looking at your um, the, at your feet and at the joints of the ankle and toes are you seeing any swelling, redness, or yeah, any swelling or redness?

P: Um no no swelling or redness.

D: All right, are there is there a temperature change to your feet or any of the joints? Are they feeling hot or cold? 

P: No. 

D: OK. And is there any deformities or misalignment of any of the joints? 

P: No.

D: OK, and any scarring from any of the trauma?

P: Uhm, there are like. Yeah, there's some scarring from like ulcers.

D: From previous ones that have that have healed? 

P: Healed. Yeah, that's right.

D: OK, and. And is there any pain to palpation over the um ankle joint, over the ankle joint?

P: No.

D: OK, then how about over any of the joints of your toes?

P: Um no not nothing like that. No pain, just um I can't feel it.

D: OK. And how is the range of motion of your feet and toes?

P: Um pretty good. I can move them all.

D: OK, and then how about your knees?

P: My knees are also the same.

D: OK, uh, an any ankle like instability with any special tests?

P: No

D: OK, and and on walking is there any limp or does it appear, how does the walk appear?

P: I'm pretty normal. I'm not limping.

D: OK. And. OK, so that was everything that I wanted to ask and and check today. Did you have any questions?

P: Just what do you think is going on with my feet and how do I get some sensation back?

D: So it does sound like it could be related to diabetes where what happens is you get like a peripheral neuropathy overtime and you can lose sensation to your feet in a glove and stocking distribution, which sounds like the history history you're saying today with having sensation reduced on your feet and also your fingertips as well. 

P: Mmmm

D: Where you lose sensation and you can't feel pain. And so But other things to consider could be. Possibly like vitamin deficiencies or things like that, but I would be much much lower down on the differential. And. So to regain sensation I think. Really, the only thing that can be done now is to help prevent further damage to the nerves, and that would be to make sure that the diabetes is under good control and. Trying to monitor your feet as regularly as you can, making sure that the. There aren't any kind of open wounds or sores that are are not healing. If things are not healing, it will be important to check to see if there is an underlying infection such as osteomyelitis, which will prevent wound healing. And so if there are any, is anything like that it would be important to have that checked out. So feet hygiene is extremely important. As we're working on improving the diabetes control as well as things like cutting down alcohol could could also help as well.

P: OK OK, thank you.",905.4440625,us_medical,,,,,,,,
RES0005,data/us_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/RES0005.mp3,"D: I was wondering if you could tell us what brought you in to see us.

P: Yeah, so I just came in. I was a bit worried because I've been having this cough for around two years, which has been getting worse. But recently I've noticed that I see streaks of blood in the sputum that I'm producing. Before it just used to be like white but now I'm seeing over the last, I would say two months occasionally some streaks of blood.

D: OK, and the cough started two years ago.

P: Yeah.

D: OK. And, it's been gradually getting worse over that time?

P: Yeah, I would say so. It's getting more frequent and worse in nature.

D: OK. And how much sputum are you bringing up an in a day?

P: Probably like a, a couple teaspoons. 

D: OK, and uh, is are you seeing like bright red blood when you're when you're coughing it up?

P: Uh. In this it's kind of mixed into the sputum. I would say like, but it definitely is red.

D: OK. And how much blood would you say that you're you're bringing up would be teaspoons? Or a Cup? Or?

P: No. It's just like a little streaks. It's not really significant, it doesn't feel like the whole production of the sputum, but just like little streaks that I've noticed.

D: OK and um is the cough worse, at any particular time of day?

P: Um, it definitely gets worse when I'm doing more activities and then also when I get like some viral infections. But other than that, it's pretty much always there. 

D: OK, anything that that makes it worse? You said some viral infections. Have you had a viral infection recently?

P: Yeah, like in the last two years, I've probably had two or three viral infections, just just just cold cold symptoms.

D: Has there been anything that you've tried to make the cough better?

P: I've tried the Tylenol Cold, hasn't really worked. Tried just other over the counter medications, haven't really worked. 

D: OK. And prior to two years ago um, were you experiencing any similar symptoms like, uh, like this cough or bringing up blood before? 

P: In the past, I've always had a somewhat of a cough like I have COPD. So I've always had a little bit of a cough here and there, but over the last two years I feel that it's been getting much worse. 

D: OK, have you been diagnosed with chronic bronchitis before?

P: Yeah I think so.

D: OK. Um and so with with this cough and now blood tinged sputum, have you been experiencing any other symptoms?

P: Um, I do feel sometimes I get like more tired than I used to throughout the day.

D: OK.

P: Um, sometimes I also feel more breathless on when I'm exerting myself more.

D: OK, and have you been having any fevers or chills?

P: No, no I haven't.

D: How about any night sweats?

P: No.

D: Have you lost any weight?

P: Yeah, I've actually lost a significant amount of weight. I would say within the last 1 and a 1/2 months probably lost like 8 to 10 pounds. 

D: OK, have you been trying to lose weight?

P: No, not really I've just been sitting around like I can barely walk that much anymore too. I used to be able to walk at least 400 meters around the block, but now I can barely even go to the kitchen. 

D: OK, is this because of the shortness of breath when you are are exerting? 

P: Yeah, that and I just start coughing so much that I just have to sit down.

D: OK. Um, and have you been having any headaches?

P: No headaches.

D: Alright, and how about and how is your appetite been?

P: Um, I think it's been pretty much the same. Sometimes when I'm coughing a lot, I don't feel like eating, but other than that it's been around the same.

D: OK, any nausea or vomiting?

P: No. 

D: Any runny nose or sore throat?

P: No.

D: OK. And then how about a loss of smell or a loss of taste? 

P: No, nothing like that.

D: OK, have you been having any chest pain?

P: No. 

D: Any heart palpitations? 

P: Nope.

D: Any wheezing when you're breathing?

P: Sometimes I would say like when when, it gets worse when I'm exerting myself more, I I can get some wheezing. 

D: OK, and have you noticed any swelling in your feet or ankles?

P: No, nothing like that. 

D: Alright. And have you woken up at night extremely short of breath?

P: No, I'm pretty fine during the night. 

D: Alright And, uh, have you been having any abdominal pain?

P: No.

D: Any urinary problems?

P: Uh no. 

D: Any bowel problems like diarrhea or constipation?

P: No, nothing like that. 

D: Alright, any skin rashes?

P: Nope.

D: Any joint pains or or muscle pains?

P: No.

D: Any weakness?

P: Not weakness, I'll just say more fatigue. 

D: Alright so I know you told me a COPD, but do you have any other medical diagnosis? 

P: Yeah, I have high blood pressure as well. 

D: Alright.

P: I think I have high cholesterol too.

D: I see, OK. Do you take any medications regularly?

P: Yeah, so for the cholesterol taking Rosuvastatin and I forget what I'm taking for the blood pressure, but it's pretty well under control.

D: OK, do you use any inhalers for COPD?

P: I used to. I used to have I think like 3 different inhalers but haven't had to use them for more than 10 years now.

D: OK, and what was the reason for not needing them anymore? 

P: I just didn't have any symptoms for a pretty long time and my doc said like if I don't really need them then I could just stop.

D: OK, and have you had any recent hospitalizations? 

P: No.

D: Any allergies to medications?

P: Nope. 

D: Any surgeries that you had in the past?

P: No surgeries. 

D: OK, And are your vaccinations up to date?

P: Yup. 

D: OK, and could you tell me a little bit about your social situation or living situation?

P: Yeah, so currently I'm just living by myself in an apartment. I've been there for more than 10 years now. Um, I am retired so I'm not working anymore. But yeah, that's that's me.

D: OK, great um. What did you do previously for for work? Did you have any exposures for two chemicals or dusts or asbestos? Things like of that nature?

P: Oh yes, I worked in the steel factory for most of my working life. I think yeah, there might have been some exposures to chemicals and dust particles. Asbestos I don't think there was exposure, but definitely I may have lived in places that had asbestos. I mean, yeah.

D: OK, how long have you been living where you you've been now?

P: So this this is like the one I'm living in is a new place, but before that, I lived in another apartment for around five years and that was a pretty old building.

D: OK, do you have any pets?

P: No pets, no.

D: OK um. And do you smoke cigarettes?

P: Yeah, I smoke, I'd say around 20 cigarettes a day right now.

D: Alright, and did you smoke more previously?

P: Yeah, I think I've been smoking for almost like 40 years now and I used to smoke up to 30 cigarettes a day. 

D: OK, do you smoke cannabis?

P: No. 

D: Alright. Do you drink alcohol?

P: Um just maybe a couple times a month. Nothing, nothing throughout the week.

D: OK, so do you use any recreational drugs like IV drugs or opioids or cocaine? 

P: No, nothing like that.

D: Alright. And anybody in the family have any similar symptoms before like coughing up blood or?

P: No. Not that I know of. My father passed away from a heart attack when he was in his 60s. And I think my mother had a, um like I think one of the like, an arthritis. But yeah, like, but I think that was just like the one that you get with old age.

D: OK, like osteoarthritis? 

P: Yeah that that was the one.

D: OK. Any cancers in the family?

P: Um, not that, one of my uncles had like um bladder cancer, but that's that's that's about it.

D: OK, and have you have you traveled anywhere recently or been around any sick contacts? Possibly people anybody who's had tuberculosis or any infections?

P: No, I've been pretty much to myself over the last few months, so not really.

D: OK um. Was there anything that you're worried that this could be?

P: Um Yeah, just the blood I kind of got scared maybe I thought like you know what if it's a cancer? One of my friends had lung cancer and I I know I've been smoking for most of my life, so that's something I was worried about.

D: Um, I can certainly see that the concern and I understand where you're coming from. I think it would be very reasonable to investigate that today. So we'll start with a chest CT along with some lab work and we will get a CBC and some electrolytes, also get an ECG as well to just check your heart and we will see what what the investigations show

P: Sounds good. 

D: OK, and um, other things that um to think about this could be, uh, also like to COPD I know it's been going on a long time, but possibly could have a pneumonia that's been lingering on, particularly if it's a fungal type of infection and as well as things like you mentioned you possibly unsure if you've had an asbestos exposure in the past and stuff like that can possibly lead to scarring of the lung, and so all of these factors will be looked into.

P: OK, sounds good. Thank you so much.

P: Um yeah, if I, really if I'm just resting the elbow um it makes it better, and I've tried uh things like ibuprofen um which has helped with the pain, I'll I'll do that for um hoping I can get through work sometimes if the pain is bad enough. 

D: Right, OK. Um and if you were to describe the quality of the pain, is it sharp, throbby, achy?

D: OK, and then flexing your uh, or sorry abducting your shoulder?

P: That feels normal. 

D: OK, alright, and then how about when you pronate and supinate your forearms? 

P: Uh, pronation um?

D: So like twist your um arm inwards so that your palm is facing the floor.

P: No, that doesn't really cause any pain, pronation and supination.

D: OK, alright. Um alright, and then are you otherwise healthy or do you have any longstanding medical conditions?

P: Um I'm uh healthy.

D: You're healthy, OK. And then UM do you have, have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?

D: OK. OK, and um how long ago was that?

P: That was about uh 17 years ago.

D: OK. And was that an emergency C-section? 

P: Uh no, it was not.

D: OK um and then are you on any medications?

P: Um no, I've just been taking uh Tylenol and Advil um for the pain.

D: OK, alright um immunizations wise, are you up to date? 

P: Uh I I am, yes.

D: OK. Do you have any allergies?

P: Uh no allergies. 

D: OK, family history of any uh skeletal or muscular um issues?

P: Um no, nothing like that in the family.

D: OK, neurological issues in the family?

P: Um no neurological issues in the family.

D: OK, how about um autoimmune conditions?

P: Uh no, nothing like that.

D: OK and then um do you smoke?

P: Uh no, I haven't smoked before.

D: OK, uh do you do um marijuana.

P: No, I I don't use that. 

D: OK. Um Alcohol?

P: Um uh yeah, I'll have a glass of wine every once in awhile, but maybe just one, one a week.

D: OK, and have you been around sick contacts recently? 

P: Um no, I haven't been around anybody who's been sick.

D: OK. Any recent travel?

P: Uh nope, I've been at home.

D: OK. Um I think those are all the questions that I had for you, um did you have any questions of your own for myself?

P: Uh no, I was just wondering what this pain could be on my, in my elbow. 

D: Yeah, so right now it seems like you may have a case of something called um lateral epicondylitis. So, it's also known as uh tennis elbow, um and there are a lot of things that could kind of predispose you to this, um so it could be like the repetitive strain at work, um and like continuous contraction of your wrist extensor muscle group there. Um so for this we basically recommend um a couple of things to manage the pain. Uh but first, like in terms of imaging, I don't think it is necessary because it doesn't seem like there was any trauma and I'm not too worried about any fractures. Um so to help you treat this, um we recommend some activity modifications, so um at work not doing things that are too repetitive, especially if it's using those um extensor forearm muscles. Um and then you can use some, use a compression sleeve as well, continue taking Tylenol or NSAIDs for the pain and uh really important is physical therapy um to increase mobility and strength in that arm. Uh and as well you can apply things like ice um to it for like the pain and swelling if you see any. Uh, yeah, so it should resolve in about six months to two years at most, uh but normally it does um go away in a couple of months with some physical therapy and the compression and splints if you choose to do that. How does that sound?

P: Yeah, that that sounds um good, thank you.

D: Yeah, no worries.",825.016125,us_medical,,,,,,,,

D: Yeah, for sure, so that's kind of top on my list right now to rule out, so we will do a Covid swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results. In the meantime, you should isolate for for about 14 days and if your symptoms get worse, go to the ER and if you're experiencing things like weakness, seizures like, and you're not getting any better in a couple of weeks, or you feel dehydrated. Otherwise, supportive care at home, keeping yourself hydrated, eating well, sleeping well, all of those will definitely help as well. Does that sound OK?

P: Um so I've I've been using cannabis oil for the past month just to see if it helps with the pain.

D: OK, and has that been working for you at all?

P: A little bit I think.

D: OK. OK, so those are some of the questions I had. And I'm just gonna ask a few questions about just examining the areas that are giving you trouble. So along your back, if you if you were to press down on from the middle to your lower back, any kind of pain when you press down.

P: Um lower back, yes.

D: OK, So what kind of pain is it like sharp or is it kind of a dull aching pain?

P: When I press down it feels sharp.

D: OK, and do you have you notice any kind of swelling in your legs or, near the areas where you have pain swelling or redness, or  any warmth?

P: Um it seems to. Actually, no, it's not. It's not warm.

D: OK. And in terms of just movement, are you able to bend down?

P: I can bend down, it's just hard for me to get back up.

P: Yeah

D: OK, great. And other than that, like when you when you do any of those movements, can you, do you get like that tingling again?

P: Yeah it does. Yeah.

D: OK alright and when you stand up and walk how would you describe, are you having any kind of limping at all?

P: Um a little bit of limp yeah,  I'm putting more weight on the left leg.

D: OK, alright, so yeah, those are just some of the questions I I had for you today. Do you have any questions at all?

P: Um no, what can I do about this back pain and how long do you think I'll have it for? 

D: Yeah, so it's been happening for one month right and you're getting some symptoms in in your lower leg, so normally we would wait before we do any kind of diagnostic imaging. But since you're also having these other symptoms we we were worrying about sometimes lower back pain can lead to something called sciatica. It's just when one of the nerves get pinched, and then that's why you're getting the tingling around your right upper leg. So what we can do is. We can do if you haven't had an X Ray, we can do an X Ray of your lower back. And then we can also do an MRI. 

P: OK 

D: And. Based on what results come back at the same time we will, I will give you some information about some anti- inflammatory medications you could take to help relieve some of your pain, but other than that I will also refer you to some physiotherapy. That will help you do some exercises at home. Just ways to protect your back as well as strengthen some of your muscles to help deal with some of that pain. Yeah, so we'll get the results back. And then we'll go from there.

P: OK, sounds good. Thank you.

P: No no.

D: No, OK. Well, those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?

P: Uhh no, just was wondering what what might be going on?

D: Yeah, for sure, so right now it sounds like a viral picture. It sounds like he has a cold and possibly an ear infection. I'd have to take a look into his ear to be able to tell more uhm because some of his symptoms overlap with those of covid we'll probably do a swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Uhm and so after I take a look into his ears, we can do one of a couple of things, so if his tympanic membrane looks like it's been perforated, or if there's pus in there, then we'll prescribe him a 10 day course of antibiotics, and if I see like middle ear effusion or his tympanic membranes bulging, and he seems really sick like he has a high fever, what she does, I will again prescribe him 10 days of antibiotics. And if he has a middle ear effusion or a bulging tympanic membrane, just one of those two, and he doesn't seem to be too sick, we can reassess him in 24 to 48 hours. Uhm An antibiotic that we usually prescribe is amoxicillin. Uhh how does that sound?

Um and uh it could be that you have uh some sort of an infection, uh including um, with Covid being one of the possibilities, and so um continue to take Tylenol and and um monitor your uh fever. If it continues to get worse, or you um notice that your symptoms are just not getting better, um you should come back, you should uh, we'll also do a Covid, we'll also send in a request for a Covid swab. Um and uh we'll ask you to quarantine for the for the next 14 days and try to stay away from your husband and daughter as well, if you can at home.

RES0075,data/us_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/RES0075.mp3,"D: What brought you in today?

P: Yeah, so uh, just randomly like 2 days ago I just started having this chest pain when I'm breathing and it's just been getting worse and then because of that, I'm finding that I'm very short of breath as well, so I just got really concerned.

D: OK, I see. When did the chest pain start?

P: So, there was some discomfort like just 2 days ago, but then just yesterday it started getting very painful when I was breathing. So yeah, I would say 1 day ago.

D: OK, and were you doing anything at the time when the chest pain started? Like did you get in a car accident maybe? Or any trauma to the chest or anything you can think of?

P: No, not really. I was just at home and then I noticed that when, I like, take a deep breath in, it's just, like, a very sharp pain. It's kind of like in my right side of the chest and it feels like a stabbing pain.

D: OK, and so the pain comes on when you breathe in, or yeah, when you take a deep breath. Does the pain come on at any other points or does it go away?

P: Uh, it's mostly, yeah, I feel the sharp pain when I breathe in.

D: OK, so the pain is intermittent then, it sounds like. And has there been anything you've tried that's made the pain better?

P: Not really, just more shallow breathing, and it hurts less with that, but that's about it.

D: OK, and are there any positions that help make the pain any better like leaning forward or laying down?

P: Not really, it's uh, it's pretty much the same, I think.

D: OK, and uh, you mentioned you had shortness of breath as well. When does this come on?

P: Since yesterday it's been pretty constant and it's more like, Uh, just uh, I'm really having trouble getting any deep breaths in, so I feel like I'm having to just breathe faster and more shallow.

D: I see, OK, and has anything like this happened to you before? 

P: No, never. 

D: OK, and have you been experiencing any headaches?

P: No. 

D: How about any viral symptoms, like eye redness, nasal discharge, or nasal congestion or cough?

P: I have been having a little bit of a cough, but that's it, like, it kind of started today, but it's nothing too significant.

D: OK, alright, is the cough dry or have you brought up sputum? 

P: It is dry.

D: OK, and have you had a sore throat?

P: Uh, no.

D: How about a loss of taste or a loss of smell?

P: No. 

D: OK, how has your appetite been?

P: My appetite's been pretty good. It's like, definitely with the pain, I don't really feel like eating today, but I don't think it's changed.

D: OK, so has your weight been stable over the last several months.

P: Yeah, weight has been stable.

D: OK, and have you had any fevers, chills, or night sweats? 

P: Uhm, Nope.

D: OK, and have you had any muscle aches, joint pains or skin changes?

P: No. 

D: OK, and uhm, in the past have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?

P: No, I've been pretty healthy.

D: OK, so do you take any medications regularly?

P: No, nothing at all.

D: And do you have any allergies?

P: No, no allergies. 

D: Any hospitalizations in the past or any surgeries?

P: No. 

D: OK, and currently, can you tell me just a little bit about your living situation?

P: Yeah, so I just live with uh, a couple of my roommates. I'm going to University.

D: OK.

P: I live in like a student housing situation.

D: OK, has anybody in the house been sick or anybody that you've been around been sick? 

P: No, we've been all pretty healthy.

D: OK, and do you smoke cigarettes or use any like vape products or anything like that?

P: No, I haven't ever smoked. I do smoke weed like, I would say, once or twice a week.

D: OK, and how much would you say? Like 1 gram or less or?

P: 1 gram probably lasts like 2 weeks.

D: OK, and do you drink alcohol?

P: Yeah, just a couple of beers maybe on the weekend. 

D: OK, and are you currently sexually active?

P: Yeah, just one partner, my girlfriend.

D: OK, and, do you use condoms?

P: Yeah, we use condoms, we're pretty safe.

D: OK, and have you had a sexually transmitted infection before?

P: No, never. 

D: OK, any concerns right now or anything like that?

P: No, uh, we've been pretty safe and we've both been tested before and everything, so I'm not really concerned.

D: OK, great and has anybody in the family had like a similar presentation before, like any lung problems or heart problems?

P: No, I think my sister, she has asthma, but that's about it. 

D: OK, and uh, any cancers that run in the family?

P: Not that I know of.

D: OK, so it sounds like you had this uncomfortable feeling in your chest about two days ago, but the pain really came on yesterday and it's really painful when you have a deep deep breath. So, in conjunction with your symptoms of not being able to take a deep breath and being short of breath, it sounds like you possibly have what's called a pneumothorax and so we'll do a physical exam and do a chest X-ray as well to examine this and check vitals as well to make sure that you're work of breathing is OK and we can do some blood work and go from there.

P: OK, yeah, sounds good. Should be like, worried at all?

D: I think right now, you're speaking in full sentences and you're not short of breath at rest, typically, when this this happens, if it's small enough, it'll usually resolve on its own and so we'll get some more information from the imaging and the lab results, but it's reassuring that you haven't been getting worse since it happened.

P: OK, alright, sounds good. Thank you so much.",595.6474375,us_medical,,,,,,,,

D: Um OK, so he had these symptoms about a week ago. Did he see any, did you take him to the hospital or to a clinic?

P: I took him to our family doctor um and they just suggested some supportive treatments um which we've been doing at home like we try to keep him well hydrated, and we've been keeping an eye on his like um diapers and things like that.

D: OK, has he been um has he been, how many diapers is he um, are you changing a day?

P: Usually like about 5, 6, but yesterday it was like 2.

P: Pardon me?

D: Any allergies?

P: Oh, uh no allergies.

D: OK alright um well it looks like um I, it's great that you brought him into the emergency room. Um if he hasn't been eating, drinking well, hasn't slept well, has been fussy, and and has been lethargic and tired, uh and is having difficulty swallowing food, um that's definitely very um serious. Uh we'll have a look inside his mouth and see what's going on. It could be that he has an infection or an inflammation of some sort. Um given his fever, he probably has an infection, um and uh we'll likely start him on antibiotics and put in an IV drip just to get in get some fluids inside him, just to get him hydrated, uh and monitor him very closely. We'll also check his vitals and um we'll do uh, yeah, we'll go from there. Do you have any questions?

[Speaker 1]: So, What brought you here today?
00:04:99

00:06:100
[Speaker 2]: Doctor, I have been having shortness of breath, and I have been feeling fatigue for the past two weeks. The pain is just so much; you know how bad it is when you are struggling with your breath. Then another thing is fatigue. The fatigue  is just constant, it never goes, it doesn't want to go.
00:32:98


00:34:99
[Speaker 1]: Okay, So can you tell me more about it?
00:37:03

00:37:98
[Speaker 2]: When it starts, it feels as if I am, I am looking for my breath, as in, as in I am gasping for my breath, like something is choking me, as if I am going to die the next minute and it actually started small gradually.
00:57:99

00:59:01
[Speaker 1]: Okay. I will be asking you few more questions about that. You said shortness of breath started gradually. Can you explain on the fatigue, Is there any thing you do that makes it worse?
01:12:00

01:12:98
[Speaker 2]: Yes Doctor. The fatigue is just constant. It doesn't go at all and it doesn't matter what I do, it will still be there and it doesn't even have any time that it use to come. I always feel the same way morning, afternoon and night. The thing is just there.

02:17:00

02:18:99
[Speaker 1]: Okay, Is there any other thing that makes the shortness of breath worse? Like standing up, lying flat, exertion? Do you feel relieved by any of those things?

04:59:96
[Speaker 2]: No, I haven't had any pelvic pain.

05:02:96
[Speaker 1]: Okay, so thank you Kemi. Based on your responses, your gynaecological health seems to be normal. now lets continue with the examination of your leg. so based on your on our discussion, i'll like to perform a physical examination to better understand what might be causing your symptoms. we'll start by examining your leg, your left leg and checking your temperature.

05:35:01
[Speaker 2]: Okay, Doctor

05:38:00
[Speaker 1]: Okay, so based on your symptoms and examination,it's possible that you have a condition called deep vein thrombosis, which is a blood clot in one of the deep veins in your leg. This can cause pain, swelling and fever especially if the clot breaks loose and travels to your lungs causing a pulmonary embolism. However, we will need to confirm this with some tests, such as an ultrasound of your leg, and we will also check for any signs of infection, such as cellulitis. In the meantime, we are going to prescribe some drugs, some medication to help with the pain and the swelling. so, that's what we're gonna do for now.

06:31:98
[Speaker 2]: Okay sir. thank you, doctor,

06:33:96
[Speaker 1]: okay, so is there anything else you'll like to discuss?

06:37:01
[Speaker 2]: No, Doctor. Thank you for your help.

06:39:98
[Speaker 1]: you are welcome, Kemi. we'll get to the bottom of this together and make sure you are feeling better soon. take care.",406.9829932,afrispeech_medical,,,,,,,,

[Speaker 2]: Ok. Doctor i have been experiencing rectal bleeding for the past two weeks and it is gotten worse. Starting off as a little bit of blood in my stool but now there's quite alot of bright red blood mixed in. I have also had change of this in my bowel cavity, going from regular to alternating between my constipation and diarrhea and i have lost some weight unintentionally and i have been feeling really tired lately 

00:36:03
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Giving these symptoms. Can i? I want to start by asking you a few more questions to understand your condition better. First is have you notice any blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet room?

01:02:01
[Speaker 2]: Yes. I definitely notice blood on the toilet paper. Sometimes there's even blood dripping into the toilet after i finished going into the bathroom 

01:16:99
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That a significant amount of bleeding. So i want to investigate on this further. So i want to ask you about your diet. Have you notice any changes in your appetite or the food you're eating? 

01:35:03
[Speaker 2]: To be honest, my appetite has been i little bit up lately. I have been feeling an unusual. I have been having to force myself to eat sometimes. I haven't really made a big changes to my diet though

01:53:02
[Speaker 1]: Ok. So Thank you for sharing this information. I have a few more questions to ask about your medical history and family history and all. First can you tell me about your past medical history including any surgeries or hospitalizations?

02:21:00
[Speaker 2]: I haven't really had any major surgeries or hospitalizations in the past. I have high blood pressure but it is well controlled with medication 

02:33:98
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That's good to hear. And regarding your family history can you tell me about your family history either your mom or your dad?

02:54:03
[Speaker 2]: Regarding my family. My father passed away from colorectal cancer 

03:02:02
[Speaker 1]: Ok

03:04:02
[Speaker 2]: That's about it and my mother has breast cancer about 10 years ago but she's been in remission for several years now. I think other than that I can't think of any other illness or cancers that run in my family 

03:23:98
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. So a family history of cancer especially colorectal cancer and breast cancer can increase your risk for developing certain cancers. But now let's talk about your social history. Do you drink or smoke?

03:55:100
[Speaker 2]: I don't smoke and i quit about 10 years ago but i do drink on occasional events 

04:06:02
[Speaker 1]: That's great. Quiting smoking can be significantly reduce your of developing several types of cancer. Now let's move on to allergies. Do you have known allergies either to medications or other substance?

04:29:99
[Speaker 2]: No. I don't have any known allergies. I have never had any issues with medication or anything else like that 

04:38:01
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. Now based on your symptoms and family history and social history there are few possible conditions that could be causing these symptoms. One possibility as you mentioned is colorectal cancer and other possibility include  inflammatory bowel disease, polyps or hemorrhoids and diverticulosis. To confirm all these conditions i would like to have some test including colonoscopy and blood test 

05:21:00
[Speaker 2]: A colonoscopy sounds a bit intimidating. Can you tell me more about what it involves? And what you expect to find? 

05:33:98
[Speaker 1]: I understand your concern and i may know a colonoscopy is a procedure where a flexible tube and a camera is inserted through the rectum and into the colon. You know, to examine of the large intestine. So it is very common and safe procedure that is used to screen for and diagnosed for colon and rectum condition. So i expect to find the cause of your symptoms whether it is cancer, polyps or something else. So you see during the colonoscopy if we find any polyps or areas of concern, we can remove small samples of the tissue for further examination. This is known as biopsy. We can also take biopsies of any abnormal looking areas in the colon lining. So to sample will then be sent to a lab for analysis to determine if they are cancerous or benign 

06:44:03
[Speaker 2]: What will happen if biopsy result shows that i have cancer doctor?

06:52:02
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Excuse me, if the biopsy results comes back as positive for cancer then we will discuss the best treatment options for you 

07:08:98
[Speaker 2]: Thank you for answering all my questions doctor. I feel a bit more informed now but also more nervous about the possibility of a cancer

07:20:01
[Speaker 1]: I understand how you feel but remember that catching any potential issues early can make a big difference. I am here to support you through this process and i will schedule the test and i will take one step at a time. So please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns 

07:45:02
[Speaker 2]: Thank you. I will be waiting for the test result and i appreciate your help 

07:50:99
[Speaker 1]: You are very much welcome. 

So based on my findings from the symptoms you shared and the information shared from the patient. There's rectal bleeding for two weeks worsening over time and change in bowel habit. There's no significant past medical history, Family history and there's also family history of colorectal and breast cancer. There's no current smoking but occasional alcohol consumption and there are no allergies. So the possible diagnosis includes colorectal cancer which is the most likely based on the symptom, family history and also social history and also the second diagnosis could be inflammatory bowel disease which is known as the IBD which is less likely due to lack of abdominal pain or diarrhea.""

The patient, a 45 year old female complains of frequent urination and excessive thirst which has lasted for 2 weeks, and this frequent urination occurs mostly at night. And the patient complains, says there is no burning sensation or associated pain during urination. My diagnosis is, I suspect the patient has diabetes mellitus specifically type 2 diabetes. The symptoms of frequent urination, excessive thirst, fatigue and unintentional weight loss are classic signs of diabetes. For further diagnosis, I will request a fasting plasma glucose test and a oral glucose tolerance test.

[Speaker 1]: From my findings, Mrs. Oge, age 26, is having severe and persistent vomiting, which has lasted for 2 weeks now. She finds it difficult to keep down food or liquid. She started vomiting undigested food recently but is no blood or bile on it. The condition is associated with severe nausea and weight loss. She doesn't have any history of fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain or headache. Her last menstrual period was 8 weeks ago and her pregnancy test read positive. She has no history of similar symptoms in the previous pregnancy, neither does the condition occur when she's not pregnant. She hasn't done any surgery in the past and doesn't have any chronic illness. She also have no family history of similar illness. Mrs. Oge, according to her, does not smoke nor drink. She's not also in any prescription drugs, but she maintained that she started prenatal vitamins after she confirmed pregnant. She doesn't have any known food or drug allergies.
