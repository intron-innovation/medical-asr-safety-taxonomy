I can't hear you at the moment actually, could you turn up the volume up that's better thank you Okay, and whereabouts in your head is the pain? problems with your vision or taste and in the past when you've had headaches what have they been like anything like that? Okay, and have you had any eye checks recently? Thank you. been at work recently? So you've had a headache in the past, you said they were just general, did Do you have any other drugs at all um so I mean it's obviously the first time you've had such a bad headache and you said you'd had some altered light in front of your eyes as well but you haven't hadacetamol at the same time so if you're happy to book an appointment with us with the support line for us to do a full examination and start the medication which i've prescribed you take it with food if if you're you said that when you go to bed your headaches okay and appropriate for you because sometimes if we do think it's a migraine then you would have to change your pill if you've had these flashing lights and things like that well it's something so that pill if you were having my regular migraines with um flashing lights or other symptoms it wouldn't be suitable to stay on that pill particularly we'd have to change it something else but you can carry on"," Can you give me the phone number? Okay, sorry about that. it just started all of a sudden I woke up one morning with a headache and that was three days ago and I just keep having it doesn't really go away with ibuprofen either I try that but it just it gets a little bit better but like doesn't go away it's kind of all over but I feel say quite normal headaches, just a bit of a pressure in between my eyes, but nothing major. Thank you. But I can wake up with it in the morning. Sometimes when I stand up quickly I get a bit of a stabbing pain or if I tear in my head I kind of feel like something is all the time so sometimes I just do the day off. So I work from home all these three days. First day I work from home and then the second day I just do the whole day off and today I just tried to work from home the first half of the day, but I just stopped at the moment. No, I don't think so. No, because this is just very recent, nothing really changes. No. Probably like three beers, once a week. Apart from the apple drop and the headache, sometimes the headache gets really bad. Nothing else. Yeah. But you mentioned migraine and that reminded me that my mom suffers from okay is there anything in the pill that can close it or is it All right."

Okay. counter anything at all regularly no okay right any allergies no allergies at all right to you fine so obviously you know you just have diarrhoea about four to five times a day um you're still drinking plenty and you look like you're not dehydrated which is a good sign okay um then we start worrying about diarrhoea is if you're going more than eight times a day that means probably you are you know whatever you're eating is going straight through okay you still need to drink plenty of water because you're losing a lot of fluids okay when you go to the toilet um things that one would advise is a soft diet so avoid dairy fish meat eggs while you're having the diarrhoea go sorry okay so that will be like crackers toast jam those kind of things that's easily digestible like what we would give babies yeah when they start eating you give simple food for babies you don't give eggs or meat the first time they start feeding so that's the kind of soft diet we're talking about yeah once you are able to you know keep most of it in you can start off with some just boiled vegetables and mash once you're okay with that for about 48 hours then you can start having meat so just don't have meat immediately once you feel like you're slightly better because you might go back to square one again. 48 hours, you're not having any diarrhea, you're fine, then you can go and start having meat, egg, fish and all. So that because you prefer to just don't because what why do we say this? This because it takes much more time for meat to get digested. So because your gut flora, you know, the back bacteria in your gut is not as it should be, it takes a bit more effort for one to digest these food, while it doesn't take that much of an effort to digest mash and vegetables. Does that make sense? Yeah. So at the same time, you could have some although you can't eat milk is not a good idea, yogurts are a good idea because they are probiotics, it helps to build up the normal gut bacteria back. Okay. So those kind of now things to look out for. If your diarrhea doesn't go away in a week's time or if you are passing blood, we need a stool sample because that means you may have some particular bugs that might need treatment with antibiotics. Okay. If you again as I've mentioned previously, if you're going about six to eight times a day, That means there's a high chance that you are having dehydration and you might need to go into hospital at that point in time. If that happens, do get in touch with us again. Any questions? You look a bit confused. Yeah? Okay. And also you could get something called Dioralyte over the counter. So it helps to replenish the salts that you've been that's lost through going to the toilet. Okay. If you're a bit confused, you know, you can actually all this is all recorded in your app so you can go back. I'll put that all in detail so if you know, I know sometimes it's a bit difficult to process everything, you can go back and read the notes. Is that okay? All right then. You take care. Bye now.","Hello? Nice to meet you. Michael Johnson, 0929-83. 231 Leonard London Street. Yes. It's been happening for about three days now.

Are you still in discomfort at the moment? Okay. And when it started, how would you rate it out of 10? Okay. And how about now? Okay. And tell me, before this happened, what were you doing? Okay. And how often do you do gardening? Okay. And are you normally fit and well? So are you normally okay to garden as you would? Great. And apart from this, do you have any other medical problems? Okay. So that's high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Do you take any medications for that? Okay. And are you allergic to anything? Okay. So let me summarise what you've told me already. You were gardening a few hours ago and you experienced chest discomfort, which was roughly Seven out of ten. It feels more like someone sitting on your chest as opposed to pain. And apart from this, have you noticed anything else unusual specifically with your breathing? Okay, and is that getting worse or better? And when you get short of breath when you're walking up the stairs, have you noticed any pain? Okay, so let me confirm you have the pressure at the moment and you have shortness of breath, is that correct? So given what you've told me about your past medical history, I think it might be worth you calling an ambulance, get you to the hospital as soon as possible. Because my concern is it might be something to do with your heart. So while I talk to you, I will ring an ambulance who should come to your address. But in the meantime, I think we should stay on the phone so I can gather some more information that we can give to the paramedics. Is that okay? It's nothing to worry about at the moment, but given that you've got high blood pressure and high cholesterol and you've got some chest pain, I'm always worried about the heart first before anything else. And we need to look after your heart before anything else. So apart from this lightheadedness and this chest discomfort, have you noticed anything else unusual? You have anything to eat or drink this morning? And you feel still feel nauseous at the moment? So I have a couple of other questions to ask you and I'm going to reel them off. So apologies for not letting you talk very much. Have you noticed this pressure radiating to your head? And how about to your left or right arm? And does that pain go anywhere else to your left arm or to your back? And have you noticed any problem swallowing or drinking water? Good. And have you noticed any problems going to the loo? And you're normally fit and well apart from the two things you told me about. And do you live at home with your wife at the moment? Okay, I would suggest if she's there, you let her know that you'll both be having an adventure to the hospital today, so she might need to get your things together. The ambulance should be there very soon. In the meantime, I would suggest that you stay calm and have some water if you need to. Don't take any of those medications. The paramedics should be with you very shortly. So when they do come, there are two things they will be worried about. The one is your chest, so your heart, and the second is your breathing, which is your lungs. So they will give you lots of things to breathe through and attach things to your arms just to check things like your blood pressure and your heart rate. So don't be worried. And when you get to the hospital, you'll be seen by a consultant pretty much immediately. Right. So I will let the paramedics do their job and when you're at the hospital, the consultant would normally call me within a couple of minutes to let me know how everything's going. Great, I'll book another appointment to see you soon once you've had your adventure. No problems. Do you have any questions? Great, thank you very much.","Hello, can you hear me? I can't. Sorry. I am, yes. It's Joe Blogs. It's the 7th of June 1974. Sorry, 54. I'm supposed to be 53. But yeah. That is correct, yes. I'm experiencing this discomfort in my chest. Sure. It's been ongoing for a couple of hours now. I'll tell you this, quite suddenly I was digging in the garden and if I had to describe where it is, it's somewhere in the middle of my chest. And it's more, it feels more like a pressure than a pain. If I had to describe what that sort of discomfort feeling is, it's like someone sitting on my chest. And yeah. Yes, as you said, about a seven out of ten. Ten being very sort of unbearable in terms of pain, seven is quite manageable, what it's quite comfortable. It's still the same. Yeah. High cholesterol and they've had hypertension. No, have hypertension. Yes, I have. I've got shortness of breath. I feel slightly lightheaded. It's remained the same, although I would say recently I've noticed in terms of sort of breathing I've had some difficulty climbing instead and if I have to sort of walk uphill there's that sort of challenge as well. No pain as such, but there's often calf pain and leg swelling sometimes. Okay. Oh, okay. You're right. Um, should i be concerned about anything? Um, nothing else unusual. Um, i'm not sure if i spoke to you about nausea. Um, i've noticed some nausea, but no vomiting. Yeah. Um, no. I have, yeah, i am, yeah. Um, no, that's fine. Um, no, to my head, no. Um, yes, there is some pain in my left shoulder right now. Um, no. Um, no, no problem's going to be. Yes, however, there are some problems just performing daily activities. Like I said, with the difficulty climbing upstairs and going uphill, I try to limit my daily activity to just moving around the house, nothing too strenuous. Yes. Okay. Got it. Okay. Okay. Yeah. That sounds reassuring. Oh, that's great. Okay. That's perfect. Thank you so much. No questions, I'll just await the amendments. No problems, I'll speak to you soon. Thank you so much. Bye."," Hello?

Okay, well yeah, whereabouts was it? When did you first notice it? Did you have any fevers at that time? Did you know where you got that when it started? Did you get any bites that you noticed? Whereabouts were you in the States? Any headaches, blurred vision, tingling, numbness? And have you been able to go to work as usual? Okay, and has your concentration been affected or your tiredness levels in the day time at work? Have you been able to exercise okay? Okay, and how's your mental health, your stress levels? Regular inhalers or other medication? You haven't been easy yet, so okay. And any, do you take any other medications? Yeah, that's fine. And do you smoke? Drinking alcohol? Okay. And who do you live with at home? Sorry. So with this rash, we would need to investigate whether this has been a contributing factor to your symptoms. And just because of your symptoms, which have been ongoing for six weeks, it's obviously quite a long time to notice a change in your energy levels. I think it's important to get some blood tests, checking all the normal things, like liver, kidneys, blood count, etcetera, but also some more specific things like bacterial infection you can sometimes get, including one that you can get, which can produce a rash like that. So that would involve blood tests. Are you happy? So if you're happy to do that, if you book that through the support line and then when you've had the test arranged a follow up about a week after after you've had the test done. Yeah, we can do that over the phone to start with. Okay. Any other questions? Any other questions? Okay, that's great. Take care.","hello hi there yeah it's matt carter and it's fourteen of august nineteen eighty nine and was it what was the last bit and it's one babylon avenue yeah and it coming i don't really know what's been going on but it's just sort of that feeling really tired run down uh where are we now we just started april definitely christmas new year i felt relatively well i think and so since then actually yeah i i was on holiday in um in the states and yeah it probably coincided with some time around then end of january start of february probably a couple of weeks after i got back yeah i had a great time very active um no not that i recall Yeah, not no, the symptoms sort of all started afterwards.

And then it like it didn't actually cause too much itching or anything at the time and I it faded over a couple of weeks I guess. I to be honest that actually coincided with a bit of a sore throat I had, so possibly a little bit feverish, but I sort of put it down to that. I definitely like I do quite a lot of walking and we did quite a lot while we were out in the on holiday as well, but definitely um yeah, I mean I don't recall any bites, I don't remember seeing anything bitten, but you often like yeah as you're walking through, I was in shorts and boots, but you feel the up.

So I'm training, well, I'm currently training for a marathon, um, that's gonna happen in, June. And so, I'm trying to run like. I mean right now, I'm actually not even doing such long runs, maybe like seven or eight miles. And so, I started about uh, maybe a month ago. Uh, I've done like, you know, four or five miles, and I've just done like a couple of seven, mile runs. And then uh, uh, and then you know I go to the gym like few times a week and, kinda do my, usual routine. Um, but, yeah, I think the only thing that's really different has, have been, the runs, the longer runs. Um, well, I, what do you mean by that? I'm not sure what, what <UNSURE>that</UNSURE> means. Not, not bad, I mean it just kinda starts hurting, you know. Um. You know I would say probably starts off like after, uh, maybe, twenty minutes or so. Which is, probably I don't know like somewhere around mile, three maybe,  two and a half or three miles. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> switching my kilometres and miles, I'm not sure, <UNSURE>all right</UNSURE>. Yeah, that is a good question. So, um, you know the last few times, the last time I actually stopped, I mean I ran a little bit longer, but then I stopped, because it was um, I, I feel like it's getting worse. Um, and, when I start doing my abs, that's, you know when I do my abs. <UNSURE>It's</UNSURE> kind of requiring me to move my you know, um, to kind of go from the flex position on my knees, and straighten my legs, then I feel all this clicking. And, I think that's also freaked me out, and uh, I just figured you know, something's wrong <UNSURE>here</UNSURE>. So it's more, um, it's actually my right knee that hurts. No. So, ah, you know I, I feel it, it's kind of weird, I feel it in the middle, but I almost feel like maybe it kind of uh,  um, moves to the right, to the right of my knee a little bit. So, yes, well it's, I have, probably some fluid. I googled it, and you know it says that sometimes <UNIN/> fluid accumulates uh, <UNSURE>I</UNSURE>. Sorry? Um, well it did, like, the first time I ran, it was a little bit swollen, but then I just put some like ice on it, and it went away. Um, but, right now, right now it's not swollen, and right now it doesn't hurt, you know. Um, but, it just kind of comes on when uh, um, or you know right now when I flex and extend my leg, it, there's no clicking but, I'll notice it in the gym and then, you know, when I run it'll start hurting. No. No. No, <UNSURE>none</UNSURE>, I don't. Yes. Yes. Well, um, since you're asking. Um, yes I <UNIN/>, I take Ibuprofen, um, and I'll just kinda, use it sometime like uh, um, like sometimes I have some joint issues, but you know, that kind of, is not very frequent. So I'll take Ibuprofen for that. But you know it's nothing like major maybe, like, four hundred milligrams max, something like that. I also sometimes will um, you know, smoke a joint. Um, and, yeah, other than that, that's it. <UNSURE>No</UNSURE>. Uh, well I have sometimes, you know how sometimes like if you stand for a long time, your feet will kinda, or your legs will swell up. Like I noticed it because of my socks, I'll just kind of, notice this indentation. And then, another weird thing. I've felt this just once, but there was this tingling in my toes, like uh, um, after the run. There was tingling in my toes like on my, you know my right toes, um, so. Yes. No. Well I don't know if I really try that, but I, I will tell you that, what I noticed is like if I, you know when my socks come off, I kind of notice that indentation a little bit, I mean it's not like major, right but, I. Uh, I mean do you mean I just need to like press and see what happens, if it like kind of stays or, <UNIN/>. <UNSURE>No</UNSURE>, no, nothing like that, no. No it was just, it was that time, uh, but it was just really weird, because it kind of went on for a while. No. No. Uh, well, I had uh. You know <UNSURE>what</UNSURE> just, kind of your garden variety stuff, right, colds and, uh. I mean I, I do have, I'm far-sighted, and so I had uh, I had Lasik surgery. And then, once I had this really bad UTI, they thought it was kidney stones, and so they had me actually in ER. And if my GP didn't call them, tell them, that you know, they don't need to give me Morphine. Um, that was kind of an awful experience but, uh, other than that, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm pretty good. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Well, I'll take uh, I take vitamin D. Uh, I take melatonin. Sometimes, you know, just for cramps, I'll take, like, uh, um, ibuprofen, or actually <UNIN/>, uh, I'll take, what am I taking? Aleve. Whatever Aleve is. Think that's maybe um, Acetaminophen, or, I can't remember what class of drugs. You know occasionally, if I'm really having hard times, like I'll, I'll sleeping, I'll take Xanax. Um, but, I prefer Melatonin, it's just sometimes Melatonin doesn't work. No, no, no problems. Mm-hmm. <UNSURE>Hmm</UNSURE>. I see. OK. Well, you know I read, I read some stuff online that, that maybe like my ligaments there's, I think it's like ACL or, or something like that right, and so if that. I mean I'm kind of like freaked out that <UNSURE>that</UNSURE> may break. So do you think it's that, or? <UNSURE>Right</UNSURE>. OK. OK. Can you, so are you going to send referral for that? <UNSURE>OK. Great</UNSURE>. Mm-hmm. <UNSURE>That sounds</UNSURE> good. Thank you yeah. <UNIN/>, sure I mean, give me the, stronger medicine, I'll give that a try. <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE>. Sweet. Thanks so <UNSURE>much. OK</UNSURE>. Bye, bye.",data/Primock-57/audio/day5_consultation11_doctor.wav,data/Primock-57/audio/day5_consultation11_patient.wav,665.7,665.7,"Hi there, it's Dr. Smith from Babylon. Hi, can you confirm your name, date of birth and your home address please? Okay, are you in a private place where you can have a consultation today? What can I do for you? Okay, so when do you think it started? Okay, and any joint problems before that? And have you had any times when the knee feels like it's giving way underneath you? And does it hurt? How far into the run does it generally hurt? Oh, you're fast. And do you have to stop running or can you run through the pain? Okay, right. And you said before it's both knees. Any problems with your left one? Okay, can you just describe in the knee or show me whereabouts the pain is happening mainly? Okay, have you noticed any tenderness when you press over any areas in the knee? Okay, does it look swollen to you? Does the knee look swollen? Okay, and if you're sitting still for a while, do you have any problems when you stand up, any locking up of the knee? Can't straighten it. Any problems going up and down stairs? Any problems just walking normally? And in terms of range of movement, are you able to fully straighten the leg? And what about fully flex it? Okay. Are you taking any medication for the knee? Okay. And any other joint problems that you're getting? Any back pain, small swelling of your hands, feet, elbows, wrists, any pain? Okay. On your right side. Any change in colour or temperature of your lower legs? Any swelling which stays if you push in and then you release it that it stays there? Okay, yeah, any or any pain in the back of the calf or anything like that? And with your foot, has that gone back to normal now? Do you feel any altered sensation, tingling, numbness, anything like that? Okay, and any pain in the joints of your foot or on the underside in the arch, any problems walking around on hard floors? Okay, have you had any other medical problems before? Okay, do you take any other medications apart from the ones you told me about? Okay, and any problems with your stomach or asthma, indigestion, acid reflux? What I would suggest is definitely carrying on with the ice therapy that you've been using. So as much as you can, because that really does make a difference to injuries. It brings the healing blood into the area and it gives it the best chance of getting better. So as much as you can use the ice. Obviously you're trying to stick to a marathon program, but I would try and ease up on the running if you can. And if it if it's painful enough that you're having to stop running, then it's not a good idea to do that. It's fine to take the ibuprofen. I can prescribe you a slightly stronger anti-inflammator that you can take regularly instead of the ibuprofen, but not with the ibuprofen. But make sure you take that with food. Ultimately, we probably need to examine the knee. So the best thing I would suggest getting an appointment with the physio ther because first you can do like a long assessment and examination of the knee and then make an assessment as to whether we need to do any imagery to have a look inside the knee and see if there's any problem with the cartilage. It's it's not really possible to diagnose that over the phone over the video so we definitely would need to see you and the physio is the best point of call because they'll probably be the most likely initial treatment but certainly if the appointment time's too long to wait then we can see we can see you in the clinic as well. Yeah, if we can we can do a referral for that. If in the meantime you develop like persistent swelling, heat redness of the knee or high temperature feel unwell or it completely locks up and you can't bend and stretch it, then you'd need to see a doctor urgently so call us back in that case. Okay, I'll send it through to a pharmacy for you. Okay, thank you, bye.","Hi. Hi Dr. Stenson. Yes, my name is Mary Joe.

Like <UNIN/>, um <UNIN/> the other common thing around Thailand, it will be like some dengue.  But that would have, like you would have some, uh, blood spots or bleeding or something, which you don't have at the moment, do you? OK. So where is the rash? How would <UNSURE>you describe</UNSURE>, how would you describe the rash? Red and itchy. OK. So if you were to put a glass on top of the rash, does that rash go away? It goes away. OK. OK. So <UNIN/> what we need to do, <UNIN/> need to urgently examine you. And that's sometime today. OK? And um, after our examination there is a high possibility that sometimes we might need to send you to hospital. But I'm not sure as yet. So I'd like you to be seen in one of our hubs as soon as possible? So um, I'll <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> recommend that you would need to be urgently seen by the doctor, preferably in the next few hours time. OK? And um, in any case if that's not available I'd like you to take yourself to <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. Alright? Any questions at all? <UNIN/>, you know obviously when I've spoken to you, you, you didn't tick the box for many theories, but you're in the middle somewhere. Let's put it that way. Um <UNIN/> you know things like we have to rule out is Meningitis and all, but Ben, you just have a general muscle ache. You didn't say that you had things like, you had problems looking at the light or something <UNIN/> Those are things when you think of Meningitis But and then, it's the uh, in meningitis you get a non-blanching <UNIN/> rash. While in any kind of virus <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> the rash usually goes away. Saying that, we don't know whether these are the beginning stage. So that's why I'd rather, but I would rather you see a <UNIN/> GP as soon as possible, if uh, we've got a slot available. But if not, I think you need to be seen, and maybe have some blood tests and examinations. OK? All right, you take care, Ben. Bye now. Cheers. Bye.","Hi. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Yep, uh, John Doe.

No problems, no problem. Ask about anything else, sir? Right. Okay, all right. And just moving on swiftly, sir. Do you have any allergies at all? Just allergies to medications, really, I'm asking, not as opposed to other things. Okay. And just very briefly, socially, sir, just one of those very important to ask. You said you live with your wife. Anyone else at home with you? Well whatever you drink is a pye beer lager wine spirits okay okay and what about smoking sir okay okay well i wish you all the best on your journey to quit i highly recommend it if you can it will certainly help your health as well so just to really just to summarise i think you know based on your story i'm not i'm not worried i think you know what you essentially have is a bit of a viral illness perhaps a bit of a maybe early signs of a flu which i think should settle down really on its own over time things to you know you can do to help yourself you know you stay rested drink plenty of fluids if you are if you are feeling caught and colds and wet your taking regular paracetamol would be beneficial you mentioned feeling a bit short of breath i'm a little bit on the edge about giving you antibiotics i don't think you've got a chest infection but what we could think about is giving you a a script for antibiotics which you may be use in the next twenty four to forty eight hours if your symptoms don't get better Yeah, yeah, yeah, i'll give you a script today, give it about twenty four to forty hours. If you feel like you're still feeling breathless and run down, I think there's no harm in starting a course of antibiotics, something like amoxicillin, one tablet three times a day. And if you're still on better by next week, come back and see me and we can have another look. Exactly. Yes, absolutely. Great. Well, I'm glad I could help. And I wish you and your football team all the best. Thank you. All the best. Bye bye.","Hello? Yes, yeah, i can, i can. Cheers.

Well, it's a team called Partick Thistle and they're in the, they're not even in the top division of the Scottish League, they're actually in the, the, the championship, which is the league below that, and they're bottom of the table, so i've been shouting myself a wee bit hoarse because the performance has been pretty shy, if i'm being honest with you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, i shave every day, so i'm, i'm looking at myself, it's not, not, not pretty sight to be honest with you, at the best of times, but it's been a wee bit, a wee bit rough the last few days for sure.

I would like a GP to assess you. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> what you're, what you're describing might be something called Bell's Palsy. OK? Um, We can go into that, explaining what that is, if um, if that's confirmed on, on physical examination. But um, that's not usually a <UNIN/> life-threatening problem.

Have a look, have a look inside the ear, see if there's any, <UNIN/>, anything to see within the ear. So, um, um, so, in answer to your question.

Um, it's been, it's been a few weeks now. Um, been about three weeks or something.

So like, my jawline's just all feeling a bit numb round here. Not that I, <UNSURE>not that</UNSURE> I've noticed, <UNIN/>. I think, occasionally noticed <UNSURE>a</UNSURE>, ringing in my ear. Um. <UNIN/>, <UNSURE>yeah it's</UNSURE> <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. No, no, no, no, nothing like that. No. No, no. No, that's all good. Uh, yeah. It kind of, kind of, there quite often, <UNSURE>so, all the</UNSURE> time. So yeah, right now it feels very, doesn't feel like when I touch <UNSURE>this</UNSURE> side of my <UNSURE>face</UNSURE>. No, nothing, nothing coming out. Uh, no, <UNSURE>don't think</UNSURE> so. No, nothing like that. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Pardon? Ohh, no, no, no, don't use cottons buds, <UNIN/> like that. Um, I've, well I've got kind of, been told I have polyps in my nose in the past and, occasionally get them kind of <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. Um, that, that's all fine and, you know I take a <UNSURE>Rennie's</UNSURE> if I need to, and if my nose polyps are playing up I've got a spray. Um. Other than that I think they said, ages ago, I had something called, can't quite remember but, labyrinthitis, something like that, but again, nothing, nothing <UNSURE>ongoing</UNSURE>. Yeah, so, no, uh, I only take the, spray for my nose when I need it for, and um, sometimes take <UNIN/> like Rennies, but I just get that from the chemist. Uh, yeah, they gave me a prescription ages ago. Unfortunately I don't, sorry. No. Uh, no just <UNSURE>Latex</UNSURE>. My brother had, Neurofibromatosis, I think it is. Um, other than that everyone else is OK. Yeah, so I'm a, I'm a jockey, um, but, because of all the kind of, these symptoms I've been getting, especially sometimes when I get a ringing, I can feel a bit dizzy. <UNSURE>Ohh</UNSURE>, I've just had to do far less training. So, kind of beginning to, yeah, impacting work, um, a little bit now. Yeah, yeah. Um, I, uh, live with my partner. No, no pets. Uh, no, just like, like I said, like the ringing um, occasionally and, when I get that I can sometimes feel a bit dizzy but, the main thing is really the, lack of hearing, and the numbness that's got me <UNIN/> like,  yeah, no idea what's going on there. I <UNSURE>mean</UNSURE>, there was just like, there was one thing I think <UNSURE>just</UNSURE>, 'cause I can panic and you can look online, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> get a bit, frantic. <UNIN/>, I guess what I'm trying to think is, you know, is there something particularly serious <UNSURE>that</UNSURE>, you know, will need to be sorted and. Obviously, really, anything can just make you really frantic <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. Hopefully nothing <UNIN/>, so serious I will die from it, I don't know I just, I think <UNSURE>got myself</UNSURE> in a pickle. Mmm. OK. <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE>. Yeah. OK. OK. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE>. Mm-hmm. Yeah, <UNSURE>that's</UNSURE> fine. OK. OK. Yeah. <UNIN/>, that's fine. OK, yep, <UNSURE>I</UNSURE> will do, that's fine. Thank you very much.

Is, is that OK? Am I meant to Just <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> connection on the screen. OK. Um so, um my name is uh Dan Choudhry. I am seven, twenty seven. Um so I've just um, been having some troubles, basically in the <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> uh, I guess it's been a little while now. And I've just been feeling not so great. And It's all come from like, uh it's like basically I think it's diarrhoea. And it's like just coming out, like loads of it. Like I go to the toilet and it's just super watery and it Yeah it doesn't feel very solid. It so, it just, it's just pouring straight from my bum, and like just coming out. And it's, uh, Yeah it's just uh not, not been very pleasant. And like I just, it just kind of hasn't, doesn't feel like it's getting better. So Um, so I think it was a few, when I think about it So Monday, Tuesday, I I, so I think it was about three, it's been about three days now. Um so I <UNIN/>, I feel like it's like almost every hour, when I'm awake. Um, <UNSURE>so </UNSURE> <UNIN/>. Sorry? Yeah, so I mean I'm <UNIN/>, I'm trying to drink a lot of water. But um, yeah it's just quite a lot and Uh it's, yeah I I, I think I <UNIN/> I feel like it's just, just fluids coming out. Um So I, no I don't, I don't remember anything, like, no I <UNIN/>, I think it's just I, nothing like that. There's nothing like that. Yeah. I mean I, it, I feel, I feel a <UNSURE>cramp</UNSURE>. <UNIN/> and then, and then I know it's time to go right? So, <UNIN/>around every hour I just feel something come up. And then I have to go. So, yeah I mean that's, that's the <UNIN/>, kind of the first sign. It's kind of, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. If I think about it, it's like, it's like at the bottom. Uh, I don't know if that makes sense. Um Um I I think it it <UNIN/>, it feels pretty <UNIN/>, like in the middle, to me. Not on any side, left or right. Um, it it comes and goes. It comes and goes. OK so like Um <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> So What do you mean by, uh pain? So I, I think it's maybe a I I guess so. I'm, when I think about it, like when I get it, I can pretend that I don't feel it. So I can still sit down and Uh I can still like cover it up, and people don't really notice. So I, I don't know what that means. But maybe is that like a six, or a seven? <UNIN/> <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE>. Um, yeah I definitely, I definitely feel kind of nauseous. Um Like I and, like I've have vomited. And when I like, I think it's maybe something to do with like, whenever I have like milk or something like that, I just feel like I want to vomit. And actually, <UNIN/> yeah one time I just like had some milk, and I just completely vomited it. <UNSURE>Um, I've been</UNSURE>, I've been trying to avoid it. But um, yeah. Um, sorry could you repeat that? Uh no, no it's not. Um so I, yeah I think I am pretty, I feel kind of really hot all the time. And uh I'm pretty sure I'm burning up. I haven't actually done any temperature reading, or anything like that. But it's, I, yeah I've, I've sure I'm, I'm not a, like not a normal temperature. Um yeah a bit, I guess less frequently maybe. Um but yeah, it seems to be OK. Um so I <UNIN/>, so my um my brother has had, actually had something like this for um <UNIN/> he has it as well for five days, as well. Um and I I've, I'm not, yeah I <UNIN/> I can't think of what, what the trigger is for me. I mean, my brother normally can deal, deals with this stuff a lot better than me. But <UNIN/>, yeah I, that's why Um He, so he's been like this for five days. I think he's getting better, but I'm not, I'm not really sure. He said, he said he had, he's had something for a little while as well. Um so it just feels like the, the fluids do go down. But it just feels like it's going straight through. It just feels like it's going straight through. Um so, I had some, I mean I had some lunch today. Um But again it just it <UNIN/> just came, come out pretty loose. Um, so I um, yeah I think, I think otherwise I'm fit and well. I um Yeah I mean I, I'm an OK weight. And um, I I can't think of any related medical history. Um, I mean like my, yeah I <UNIN/> no I <UNIN/> I don't think so. So I Um No I mean I, I've been taking some like Paracetamols and stuff like that lately. But uh, I haven't been, I'm not on any regular medication or anything like that. Um, so I don't have any allergies that I know of. Um bowel, so would, would bowel like, is is the colon like something that <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> So my, yeah my, my dad actually has um colon cancer at the moment. So um, from what I heard he's kind of, So I don't I don't speak to him that often. So I don't, I don't know the exact details. And I, I don't exactly know the full things of like the steps of cancer, and all that kind of thing. But um, he's sort of in his third stage. Uh, I'm not sure what that means exactly. Um, and yeah. So yeah it's, it's um, he's, yeah you can, yeah I can see he's kind of weaker, and it's affecting him a lot. And um, that's <UNIN/> it's quite, I I guess he's um, had it for a little while now. Um so, uh not my brother. He doesn't live with me. I'm, I live with my, um sister and my mum. Um, I think, <UNSURE> I mean</UNSURE> in what sense do you mean that? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> I mean uh I think uh, yeah it's been, it's been tricky. Um Going to work with all of this. Um I dislike um, taking time off work. I feel like I I just want to go, um when I can. So I <UNIN/> I try and go um I think at, at home, uh yeah I just haven't really um I I don't normally actually um, eat with my family. I normally am buying stuff and that kind of thing. So, I don't think it's affected them. And I haven't really been, haven't really gone into detail with my sister and my mom about it. Um Yeah. I'd, I'd just rather deal with these things. Um so <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Um So I work at a, I I work at um an office, um in Central London. Um it's uh, so I work in government. Um so I I smoke um, I smoke uh, uh for like socially, but not like regularly. Um So normally if if it's a, a Friday or something like that I might, I might have a cigarette or something like that. But um not <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. Sorry? So alcohol, um <UNIN/> uh you know I might have a a beer during the weekdays, maybe uh not that many, maybe um <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. On Fridays I have more um alcohol um But yeah uh, I'll have my units um Uh, honest, I suppose um, not every week, but maybe I'll once or twice a month, that yeah, I'll go out with my friends and drink a lot so that that's um, yeah um OK. OK. Uh-huh. Should I just drink like normal water? I just feel like every time I drink <UNIN/> it's just coming out. Um <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Do i need like a prescription for that? OK. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> OK. OK. So you're saying that I should, <UNIN/> I could, uh I'll try and buy this Dioralyte. What, what should I do in terms of um, food and that kind of thing?

Okay, you can well, they're fluid is probably best, but I am obviously worried about the fact that you are losing minerals and vitamins. So you can get things like Dioralyte, which is a fluid replacement we can get from the pharmacy. It's probably worth recommending that. No, you can just get over the counter. You can try just, you know, regular paracetamol if you are feeling feverish. But if your symptoms aren't settling down in the next couple of days, so 48 hours, I want you to give me a call back. Because, you know, if you are getting dehydrated, then we need to do further investigations, okay?

Yeah, yeah. <UNIN/>, yeah, exactly. I've, I'm <UNIN/>, kind of struggling to breathe at the moment. I, I got stung by a wasp, um, recently. Well, I'm not sure whether it's kind of bitten or stung. Um, but I, uh, I'm feeling like slightly anxious that, uh, there's a bit of, I've got a bit of a, a rash on my arm where, i got stung. Um, and, I've, kind of. But yeah, as I say, I've got this difficulty breathing and potentially, um, there's a bit of swelling in my lips. <UNSURE>My</UNSURE> tongue feels a bit weird. Um, it was, just a few minutes ago. Yeah, it's just kind of on the right-hand side. Um, and it, and it's just a bit sore, maybe it hasn't kind of <UNIN/>, fully swollen up yet. Yeah. <UNSURE>Yeah</UNSURE>. Right. I, I, I <UNIN/>, I don't, feel like it's <UNIN/>, like particularly acute, but i'm just kind of a bit anxious that it might get a bit worse. I don't, I just wanted to speak to someone. Uh, not that I know of. Uh, I haven't no. Um, I, <UNIN/>, I, I find it difficult to tell the difference between a bee and a wasp, but um, <UNIN/>, yeah it was one of the two. Yeah, it was on my arm. Uh, yeah sure. Um, it's just, just there. Mm-hmm. It's, it's slightly red, yeah and, and kind of there's, a bit of a, like a hole there, where I think that the wasp, stung me. Uh, <UNIN/>. Not particularly. I, I guess it's just a bit kind of blotchy, uh, and a bit of a rash. It doesn't feel like, particularly swollen. Um. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Not at the, not at the moment, no.

Yeah. Yeah. OK. Uh, no, I think, I think that kind of, that makes me feel a bit better.

Great. <UNSURE>Yeah</UNSURE>. OK, great. Yeah, that makes sense. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> OK. Thanks. I appreciate your time. Bye bye, bye.",data/Primock-57/audio/day2_consultation06_doctor.wav,data/Primock-57/audio/day2_consultation06_patient.wav,598.26,598.26,"Good morning. Good morning. Sorry, before we start, can I get your full name and date of birth? Is that possible? Yeah. That's perfect. Thank you for that. Are you John, are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment? Perfect. Thank you for that. Okay, so tell me what the problem is. You've been having some difficulty breathing, is that correct? Right. Okay. So when did this bee sting or bee bite occur? Right. Okay. And your lips don't seem swollen to me right now, but do they, which, can you show me with your finger where you feel it's swollen? Sure. Okay. You said you've been having some difficulty breathing. Your breathing seems all right to me right now. The reason why I'm clarifying this is because we have to decide whether this is an acute emergency, whether I need to send you into hospital straight away, or whether we have more time to ask questions. Okay, so do you feel that you've got difficulty breathing right now this minute as we speak? No, sure, sure. Now you do the right thing and I can understand it is quite anxiety provoking. Okay, alright. Can I just double check before we carry on and ask any other questions? Have you got a history of anaphylaxis? No, okay. Have you ever been given an EpiPen? Okay, alright. Let's take a step back now. So in terms of the bee singers, did you see the bee or you're just assuming it was a bee? One of the two. Okay, and the area of your body that's stung, where was it? Do you say it was your arm? All right, and you've got a rash there. Can I have a look? Okay, alright. That looks okay to me right now. Did it look red to you at the moment? Yeah, yeah, yeah, the puncture mark, yeah. Okay, alright. Now is there any swelling around that area that you can see? I couldn't see any. Sure, okay, alright. Now, have you taken any medication? It's probably you probably haven't because it was a few minutes ago, but have you is it not taking any antihistamines or anything like that? Okay. Now, if I can just go back, do you have any history of any kind of illnesses at all? Okay. And in your family, is there any history of any illnesses or any history of any kind of acute reaction? Right. And do you have allergies to any kind of cats or dogs or pets or anything like that? Yeah. And you've got no food allergies as far as you're aware. Okay. Can I ask do you suffer from anxiety or panic attacks or anything like that? Right, okay. Have you ever been on medication for that? Okay. Great. Now, I need to ask a few questions, maybe not directly related to this, but just for general information purposes so are you are you working at the moment what do you work as okay and you living alone okay do you have any pets at home okay great what i'd like to do now if that's okay john is i'd like to have a look inside your mouth okay one of the things that um we'd be worried about if someone's going to have an acute allergic reaction is to see whether there's any swelling of the lips or the tissues inside the mouth or the soft tissues of the airway and um i can i've got a fairly good view of your lips but i'd like maybe if you can bring your device closer to your mouth and then put your head back mouth open wide sit somewhere where there's good lighting and i just want to have a look inside the throat if that's okay perfect okay great now um um can can i just get you to do it again and just say r this time okay fantastic brilliant okay um uh john based on how you look how you're talking to me and how you're breathing and the appearance in your wrist um i don't feel that you're having a life threatening allergic reaction now it's very normal to have a rash when you have some kind of insect bite it's a localized inflammatory reaction that is normal and that in immediate reaction that redness and that's maybe slight swelling is usually temporary what we're worried about is when someone has um compromised of their breathing so you mentioned breathing difficulties and the amethyst swelling you like thankfully i can't see any of that right now but that's the most urgent and most pressing thing that we'll be watching out for given that it hasn't happened initially it's unlikely to happen later okay so we have like a stage one or stage two reaction for these types of bites and usually if you're going to have the reaction it will happen straight away so we may be coming out of the danger zone now it's um but i'm just going to warn you about what those signs and symptoms are in case it happens so for example you would have swelling of the lips difficulty breathing you might have something called stridor which is an inspiratory sound that you when you try and try and breathe it makes like a rasping sound like this okay so thankfully you don't have anything like that right now it seems to me that this is a localised allergic reaction however if anything changes if anything deteriorates either make an appointment with us or go straight to a and in some cases if it's if it's progressing rapidly it's better to go straight to a and e and and in some cases if it's if it's uh progressing rapidly it's better to go straight to a and e rather than to wait for a booked appointment with us okay what i'd like you to do now is i'd like you to try and take some antihistamines so you can buy the counter you can get periton or chlorpheniramine and you can take one tablet four milligrams up to about six times a day okay or you can just take a one a day one which is your preference that's that's absolutely fine there's no no issue that should be enough to control this um if the redness in your arm spreads and it feels hot or you know you have signs of any localised Infection, we may need to think about other treatments like an antibiotic. And like I said, if anything deteriorates in terms of your breathing, that's urgent and we need to process that. You need to be taken urgently. Did you have any other queries or was there anything else that you were worried about? Yeah, over the counter. You don't need to any chemist will have it. You don't need a prescription for that. It's probably cheaper to buy it over the counter actually than to get it by prescription. Okay. Now, on the basis of what you told me, I don't think you need any allergy testing. I think this is just a straightforward, localized reaction to an insect bite. However, if it was to happen that you know this, you're having these kind of reactions on a regular basis or other non-symptoms, we might need to think about blood testing. I don't think we're at that moment yet. Okay, so we'll leave it like that for now. Okay, I'm going to leave it to some information about anaphylactic reactions just for you to read about it. I don't want you to panic, but just for you to be aware what the symptoms are. If those kind of things happen, get back to us. If you're feeling worried, just have a low threshold for having a chat with us. Sometimes a chat is all you need to calm things down. All right then, John. Okay, well, we'll leave it like that for now. Okay, come back to us if you have any further issues. My pleasure. All right, then, John. Okay, well, we'll leave it like that for now. Okay, take care then. All the best. Bye-bye.","Hello. Good morning. Hi, I'm John Doe. Yeah, sure. My name is John Doe and I'm 27 years old. So I was born in 1991, 17th of November. Yeah, yeah.

Yes, uh, I am a computer scientist. Yes, um, I have a cat. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. No, I think I think that kind of that makes me feel a bit better. I guess. Can I get that? Can I get the, so the antihistamine from any shop or like, does it have to be a pharmacy? Okay. Okay. Great. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, thanks. I appreciate your time. Bye-bye. Bye-bye."," Hi there. I'm Dr. Dean Meza from Babylon. Good morning. Good morning. Sorry, before we start, could I get your full name and date of birth? Is that possible? Yeah. That's perfect. Thank you for that. John, are you in a private finger where you feel it's swollen sure okay uh you said you've been having some difficulty breathing Thank you. No. Okay. Have you ever been given an EpiPen? No. Okay. All right. Let's take a step back now. So in terms of the bee sting, few minutes ago, but have you not taken any antihistamines or anything like that right okay have you ever been on medication for that lips, but I'd like maybe if you can bring your device closer to your mouth and then put your head back, mouth open wide, sit somewhere where there's good lighting, and I just want to have a look inside the throat, if that's okay. Perfect. Okay, great. Now, can I just get you to do it again and just say ah this time? usually temporary. What we're worried about is when someone has compromise of their breathing. So you mentioned breathing difficulties and you mentioned swelling of your lip. Thankfully I can't see any of that right now, but that's the most urgent and most pressing thing that we'll be watching out for. Given that it hasn't happened initially, it's unlikely to happen later. Okay, so we have like a stage one and stage two reaction for these types of bites, and usually if If you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to go straight to A&E rather than to wait for a booked appointment with us, okay? What I'd like you to do now is I'd like you to try and take some antihistamines. So you combine them with the counter, you can get Pyrotone or Glufenamine, and you can take one tablet, four milligrams, up to about six times a day, okay? Or you can just take a one-a-day one, whichever is your preference, that's absolutely fine, there's no issue. That counter actually than to get it by prescription okay um now um on the basis of what you told me i don't think you need any allergy testing i think this is just a straightforward localized reaction to an insect bite however if it was to happen that you know this you're having these kind of reactions on a regular basis or other non-specific rashes you might need to think about blood testing i don't think we're at that moment yet okay so uh but that's something to bear in mind in case this becomes a recurrent factor."," Hello.

Yes. <UNSURE>Brian</UNSURE> <UNIN/>. Hi Daniel. And your date of birth? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. Ninety two. OK, Daniel. And uh, are you in a, a comfortable and confidential place to talk? <UNIN/>, happy to go ahead. Great. How can I help? OK. And how long has this been going on for Daniel? OK. And, so, tight chest, three hours. Um, and, so you're born in ninety two, so that makes you twenty six? Um, and, you are, uh. Any shortness of breath at all, with that? Uh, any cough? Wheeze? Slight cough, yeah. <UNIN/>, sore throat? Runny nose? Sore ears? <UNSURE>Mm-hmm</UNSURE>. Are you feeling better now, other than the tight chest? Right. OK, OK, but you now, now you've got this, this um. So you've still got, still got uh, symptoms of a cold, essentially? Uh, ooh, yeah, OK. And are you coughing up anything? And, um, do you have any other medical problems, like asthma? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, OK. You have any, inhalers? Or any, any medications? Yeah. <UNSURE>Clenil</UNSURE>, Clenil Modulite, yeah, OK. And um, uh, have you been using Clenil and the Ventolin? And how often have you been using them? Both <UNSURE>of them</UNSURE>? Yeah, sure. OK. All right, all right. So, so, so you've, you haven't got any Clenil, or any Ventolin at the moment? OK. All right. Um, and <UNIN/>, any drug allergies, that you know of? OK, great. Now, uh, do you, anyone in your family have any medical problems, that you know of? Hmm. OK. Um. Right. So, just uh, <UNIN/>, do you have any other, sort of concerns? Or ideas about what might be going on? Or, um, hopes for this consultation? Yeah, absolutely, I can, I can imagine. Um, well, it certainly sounds like uh, you've, you've had this cold, so you've got wheezy with a cough. Um, and it's non-productive cough, and you're short of breath. Uh, is the cough worse at night-time? Yeah. OK. And you've got this tight, tight chest. But you, you wouldn't say you've got chest pains? It's more of a tight chest, is it? Yeah, sure. Um, OK. Well, I, I would quite like to, uh, certainly get you some, uh, Ventolin, Clenil Modulite. Have you had asthma exacerbations in the past? Yeah. Have you ever been to hospital, uh, as an inpatient? As in, you know, stayed in there overnight, for asthma? Ohh, OK. So you, so, so you, uh, you <UNIN/>, you went to hospital, and had a, a, <UNIN/>. So you stayed in hospital for a few days did you, with an asthma exacerbation? OK, but currently you're just on Ventolin and Clenil? And you haven't got any of those <UNSURE>steroids</UNSURE>, uh, those inhalers at the moment? OK. When, sorry, how old were you when you had that severe asthma exacerbation? Sure. OK. Um. Just to quantify how short of breath you are, um, I don't suppose you've got a peak flow with you? No, you won't have will you. <UNSURE>Um</UNSURE>, are you able to, uh, like walk up, flights of stairs OK? Walk on <UNSURE>the</UNSURE> flat OK, without getting to short of breath? Or um, are you short of breath at rest? Sure. Yeah. OK, but you're not short of breath at rest at the moment? OK, fine. So, what, what I think, um, and just to, just to go over, <UNIN/>. Is there anything you had hoped about getting other than the uh, a, prescription for your inhalers? Was there anything else you'd hoped about getting from this? Sure, yeah, no, <UNSURE>absolutely</UNSURE>. Well, I'm really glad you have <UNIN/> talked to me today. I think what we can do is, is give you a prescription for, uh, some more of the inhalers. We can get that to you, within the hour, I would hope. Um, and, uh, I think, what, the other thing I'd like to do is just give you a, dose of steroids. So this is, these are tablets which, um, you can take for five days. Uh, two tablets in the morning. And, uh, that should just dampen down your asthmatic response, OK. Um, now there are some side effects to the steroids. Which I should really tell you about, but please read the label, <UNSURE>that's</UNSURE> associated <UNSURE>with</UNSURE>. Don't be too worried about the side effects. They're <UNIN/>, most, you know <UNIN/>, most of the time the steroids are, very well tolerated. And, uh, you <UNIN/>. Have you had them in the past, do you know of? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. Have you had steroids in the past? Probably, yeah I would <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> too. So, um, they, they can come, they can make you, your mood change, can be slightly low or <UNIN/> too, slightly high. Can give you, a high blood sugar, um, and, uh, <UNSURE>their</UNSURE>. Uh, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, they can also cause rash, nausea, um, headaches, but, mostly is well-tolerated, and it should help your asthma an awful lot. Um, uh, what I'd like to do is, is send you these, the, some prescriptions for your, uh, inhalers, <UNIN/>, ongoing. So you, um, you can, once you get better from this asthma attack, you can, you can, use the Clenil Modulite in the morning, with Ventolin as a PRN. <UNIN/>, so, a Ventolin when you need to, um, when you're getting <UNSURE>wheezy</UNSURE>. If you should start to use the Ventolin more than, uh, every three hours. Uh, at, at anytime, it's a good idea to seek medical attention. So, um, see a doctor, um, in some capacity. Uh, and, the other thing I'd like to send you is a spacer, which would allow the medication to actually, go into your lungs better. Have you, do you know what a spacer is? Have you used one before? Have you got one? OK. All right. Well, um, I'll send you another one, and it has some instructions about how to use it, but essentially, uh, couple of puffs to prime it, inside, breathing in and out, um, uh, for five or <UNIN/>, five or ten breaths. Uh, yeah. So. Uh, was there anything else that was on your mind? Or you're concerned about at this stage? OK, and, and uh, I might give you some time off work as well. You can self-certify first seven days, but uh, I think I would advise you just to, rest a little bit until you're feeling a bit better, if you're OK with that. All right? <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE>. No worries. Any deterioration <UNSURE>in</UNSURE> your symptoms, like worsening shortness of breath. Um, or just generally concerning symptoms, uh, pain in your chest tightness, uh, feeling light-headed. Uh, then, seek further medical attention anytime please. OK? OK. Thank you. Bye bye.","Hello.

It's called uh, Salbutamol. I got that one, and then I have a steroid, a Clenil, Clenil inhaler. <UNSURE>Yeah</UNSURE>, yeah. Um, well to be honest, I was away at uni last week, and I forgot to bring it with me, so I haven't really in the past week. <UNSURE>Uh</UNSURE>.

And I had a milk protein allergy, when I was young too. Um. Not really, like I feel like asthma's probably a part of it, and, probably getting my, inhalers would be helpful Um. <UNSURE>It's just</UNSURE> kinda scary, 'cause I haven't had, a time like this where I've been so, tight, uh, in a long time. I mean, it gets a little bit worse at night but, basically, just pretty consistent, and it hasn't gone away. No, not really pain, it's more like, tight. It just feels like sometimes, <UNIN/> I can't get a full breath in, you know. Not in a long time. When I was young, a little bit, more like, back in high school. Um, but, I've been pretty good at taking my <UNIN/>, my inhalers, so, not, not so much any more. Yeah, when I was in high school, I had to have a tube put down my throat. Yeah I did, yeah. Yeah, I'm <UNSURE>doing</UNSURE> pretty good, I'm doing pretty good, just on the Clenil, and the Salbutamol. Uh, I think I was like seventeen. Sixteen maybe. <UNSURE>No</UNSURE>, no. Uh, I'm definitely not short of breath at rest, like, except for that feeling I was describing.

My date of birth is the nineteenth of September, nineteen ninety three. My address is, uh, sixty four, Cliveden Place, in, South Wimbledon. Yes I am, yeah. Um, I've been feeling really anxious over the past few months. Um, I just get really nervous every morning about leaving the house, and it's started to really worry me, and just add up, and build up on that anxiety. And I just didn't know, who to talk to or, so I wanted to check with my GP. Um, I guess so, I think um, I would say maybe about two months or so, I've been feeling like this, and that probably coincides with, me starting a new job, um. Which <UNSURE>I</UNSURE> <UNIN/>, I would say it's quite <UNIN/>, I mean every job is stressful, <UNSURE>and</UNSURE> when you first start, but it's been really stressful I think over the past two months, definitely. Um, so I work for a, a, a fashion retailer, in um, the head office team, and it's just a brand new sector. I've never worked in retail before, my boss is not very nice to me and <UNSURE>I don't</UNSURE>. But I also think that, it's just been, I just really dread, going there. I just hate, speaking to her, I hate like seeing everyone and, really worried about whether I'm doing well or not. And it's really <UNSURE>impacting</UNSURE> on like, on the rest of my life, like my sleep and stuff like that. <UNSURE>Right</UNSURE>. Yeah, <UNSURE>this is</UNSURE> really so, I, I, I've, as I say like, I don't want to go to work in the morning, so I just find no way of, I can't get out of bed. But it's also because, when I leave I just, when I've left work, I just feel so stressed and so worried about everything I've done, I can't get to sleep for hours and hours and hours. So I. About ten, eleven, probably. Not for ages, I'm, I'm lying awake all night <UNSURE>Mmm</UNSURE>. So I find my, my heart kind of racing, and then I'm just like panicking that I'm gonna be late, and that that's gonna make work even more stressful. So I do have an alarm, but I find myself waking up before that, 'cause I'm just my heart is racing. And actually the other day, I was just like, I was lying in bed and I really thought my heart was racing so much, I thought I was gonna have a heart attack in the morning. <UNIN/>, I just, I can't even tell because I feel like I'm, even when I'm in sleep it's such a shallow sleep, but maybe, three, four hours, I'm getting now. Probably, not, <UNSURE>significant</UNSURE> changes maybe. No I wouldn't say that, I wouldn't say that I'm eating like, much differently. <UNSURE>Ohh that</UNSURE>, I probably have more chocolate than normal, just because I feel, so down. Yeah, <UNIN/>. Yeah, So <UNSURE>um</UNSURE>, it's, it's usually kind of like, when I realise in the morning that, either um, I feel like I'm gonna be late, because I've like overslept 'cause I'm so tired. Um, or I wake up in a panic thinking I am gonna be late so, it's just kind of like, just a constant like, rapid heart beating. It's <UNSURE>just</UNSURE> really, really stressful. I don't know if it's, stress or if, <UNIN/>,  or I did think it was like, a heart problem <UNSURE>really</UNSURE> actually. Irregular, I think. Ohh it can be anything, I think <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> couple of minutes, or the other day I was actually just, sort of lying there for like, holding my hand on my chest for like ten <UNSURE>minutes</UNSURE>. Yeah, but I would say this is only in the past. Sort of like, couple of months as I say that I've been, experiencing this. No, um, well yeah it's painful to <UNIN/>, when the heart, when my heart is beating fast but, but, yeah. It's just, really, really low, <UNSURE>I mean I</UNSURE>, I'm finding now that I'm just, I find no enjoyment at all. <UNSURE>It's</UNSURE> kind of day-to-day, <UNSURE>and</UNSURE> anything that <UNSURE>I'm</UNSURE> doing. It's not just my job it's, you know when I leave I'm just so tired that, anything that, previously was, really fun is just not, <UNSURE>it's</UNSURE> not enjoyable. And I'm <UNIN/> like, yeah, on edge the whole time. Well right now <UNSURE>I'm</UNSURE>, I'm working so late, <UNSURE>and</UNSURE> everything is really, really stressful. So I don't really get much time to myself but, when I do wanna go out, or, you know, see friends or just relax. It, it seems quite difficult to do that. I avoid them insomuch that I, feel like I'm. Yeah, so I mean sometimes it just, I know that I'm not gonna have fun, because I don't want to, go out and, do things that I would normally have done. Yeah, as I say like everything that I had previously been doing has been, just difficult to continue with like, I did used to like to like go running, and. And to play tennis and stuff, but now it's just not, I'm just not enjoying it, I'm not, I'm not like, I'm not going out to do that quite so much. No, 'cause I think that would just add to the tension, but I do like pretty much every morning I think, ohh I should call in sick or like, <UNSURE>just</UNSURE> not go. <UNIN/>, um. No I wouldn't say so, I think, I've always managed to make it to work. But I, I wonder if it's building up. So this is why I wanted to call, <UNIN/> I'm <UNSURE>just</UNSURE> worried it's building up to that, and I don't know what to do 'cause I <UNSURE>have</UNSURE>, feel it, felt it, get worse and worse over the past couple of <UNSURE>months</UNSURE>. Yeah I mean, I find public transport really stressful anyway, especially being on the tube it's, 'cause it's quite, getting warmer so it's just really airless. Um, but I think the majority of it, 'cause my life is just so focused around work right now, the majority of it is focused around work as well. Not really I, I'm, no, I would say. I mean everybody always has a bit of tension, a bit of anxiety but, I've never felt, anything this bad before. Yeah. Um, I mean, yeah, yeah, 'cause I do, yeah. I'm pretty much, down like, I don't enjoy, being <UNSURE>and not just</UNSURE> my day at all 'cause. I'm just so worried about everything, um, and I find that even when I'm not, like even at the weekends and stuff it's just the, kind of like constant, feeling of just being a bit, down, a bit unhappy. Um. I don't know, that's a good question, I can't really, I can't really put a <UNIN/> on that at all. I wouldn't, no I wouldn't say that I've had, I haven't had any suicidal thoughts or any, thoughts that have been that extreme like, I haven't. You know I have, I have a good support system, like I do have good family and stuff. So I, I have, I don't have, uh worries about, actually wanting to, um, not go on. It's just that, I don't wanna go on like this. Sorry? Yeah, I live with my parents, just my <UNSURE>parents</UNSURE>. Um, ooh I don't know, probably quite a lot on the Friday or Saturday, just because, that, that's kind of normal, um. <UNSURE>Uh</UNSURE>, maybe I, maybe I do have like a bit during the week. Like, my parents obviously are retired, so they just drink whenever they want, so, whenever they're having a glass of wine, they'll offer it to me and it's like. I guess I don't really keep track of it that much. Probably like, probably quite a lot on a Friday or Saturday, because it's usually going out, so maybe like.

What can I do for you? Okay, do you mind just telling me a bit more about when it started? Do you think there's something which changed in your life at that time? What's your job? Okay, so just day to day, tell me from the start of your day how it affects you. You said you dread going to work. How does it affect you in terms of like your sleep at night and things like that? Okay, so what time do you go to bed at night? And what time do you get to sleep? Okay, and so how many hours sleep do you think you get a night? Okay, and what about your eating patterns? Any change in how you're eating or whether you have a change? Okay, you're eating regularly otherwise. Okay, and you told me about the palpitations. Just tell me a bit more about that. Does it feel like a regular fast beat or an irregular beat? And how long do you think it lasts for when you get it? Okay, is that something that you've had before this or is that a new thing? Okay, any chest pain with that? Okay. And in the daytime, how, how you said you you're not getting much sleep, so how's your energy level in the daytime? Okay, so what do you do in the evenings? Okay, what about hobbies or exercise or anything else outside work? Do you do anything else outside work? And is it ever got so bad that you've actually had to miss work? Okay. And what's the worst that it's got? Have you ever been so overwhelmed that you couldn't get into the office, you couldn't go into a situation? Have you ever had a panic attack? Okay. And apart from work, are there any other situations which provoke quite extreme anxiety, like being in public places, social situations, public transport, anything like that? Okay. Before this, did you have any similar times in your life when you felt like this? Okay. And what about your mood day to day? I mean, I can see that you're quite distressed by this, but do you ever get really down about this? And when do you think you last felt yourself? And has your mood ever been so low that you felt like you just couldn't carry on with your job or with your life or with your normal things as they were going on? Yeah, okay. And where do you, who do you live with at home? Who do you live with at home? And how much alcohol do you have in an average week, do you think? Okay, so how much would you, would you... Okay. Do you smoke or take any other drugs or anything? Okay. And have you done anything yourself to help? Have you talked to anyone, talked to any counsellors, done any online, looked online at all? Anyway. Okay. And would you be happy to have some one-to-one therapy? Okay. I mean what we would suggest in the first instance is to so you can self refer via the NHS for what we call like talking therapy is a type of cognitive behavioural therapy where they can really look at your situation, how you're reacting to the what what's provoking the anxiety and what you can do to try and overcome that. So I can send you the link for that. In the meantime so it can be a bit of a wait, there are some online resources that are really helpful. um put the details on there and you can get on with them straight away and try and work through them as well and and if you're feeling like it's not helping at all or your anxiety is getting worse to the point where you can't cope with work or you can't just do your normal things day to day then it's important for you to give us a call back and just discuss that further i mean some people with anxiety they do need to take medication to control that but that's not something that we've suggested in the first instance and i'll put some more information on your notes about helping with your sleep patterns and things like that um in terms of the palpitations it is most likely to be associated with anxiety but it's probably worth having a couple of basic blood tests just to make sure that there's not something triggering that off and then arranging a gp follow up a week after you've had the test so we can just go through the results with you so if you call this line you can arrange the and have the blood test done okay all right take care sorry sorry wherever","Hi. My name is Valerie Hall. My date of birth is the 19th of September 1993. My address is 64 Cliveden Place in South Wimbledon. Yes, I am, yeah. I've been feeling really anxious over the past few months. I just get really nervous every morning about leaving the house and it started to really worry me and just add up and build on that anxiety and I just didn't know who to talk to. So I wanted to check with my GP. I guess so. I think maybe about two months or so I've been feeling like this and that probably coincides with me starting a new job. Which I would say it's quite stressful. I mean every job is stressful when you first start but it's been really stressful I think over the past two months definitely. So I work for a fashion retailer in their head office team and it's just a brand new section. I've never worked in retail before, my boss is not very nice to me and I don't know, but I also think that it's just been, I just really dread going there, I just hate speaking to her, hate like seeing everyone and really worried about whether I'm doing well or not and it's really impacting on like on the rest of my life, like my sleep and stuff like that. Right. Yeah, so I don't want to go to work in the morning, so I just find no way of I can't get out of bed. But it's also because when I leave I just, when I've left work I just feel so stressed and so worried about everything that I've done, I can't get to sleep for hours and hours and hours. So about 10, 11 probably. Not for ages, I'm lying awake all night. So I find my heart kind of racing and then I'm just like panicking that I'm going to be late and that that's going to make work even more stressful so I do have an alarm but I find myself waking up before that because I'm just my heart is racing and actually the other day I was just like I was lying in bed and I really thought my heart was racing so much I thought I was going to have a heart attack in the morning. I just I can't even tell because I feel like I'm Even when I'm in sleep, it's such a shallow sleep, but maybe three, four hours I'm getting now. Probably not significant changes, maybe no, I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't say that I'm eating like much differently. Oh, I probably have more chocolate than normal, just because I feel so down. Yeah, so I'm it's. Well yeah, it's painful to it when the heart, when my heart is beating fast, but but yeah. It's just really really low. I'm finding now that I'm just I find no enjoyment at all kind of day to day in anything that I'm doing. It's not just my job, it's you know when I leave I'm just so tired that anything that previously was really fun is just not it's not enjoyable and I'm like yeah on edge the whole time. Well right now I'm working so late everything is really the stress of so I don't really get much time for myself but when I do want to go out or you know be friends or just relax it seems quite difficult to do that. I avoid them in so much that I feel like I'm yeah so I mean sometimes it just I know that I'm not going to have fun because I don't want to go out and do things that I would normally have done. I did use to like to like go running and um to play tennis and stuff but no it's just not I'm just not enjoying it. I'm not like I'm not going out to do that quite so much. No. I think that would just add to the tension, but I do pretty much every morning I think oh I should call in sick or like it's not going well. No, I wouldn't say so. I think I've always managed to make it to work, but I wonder if it's building up. So this is why I want to call because I'm just worried it's building up. I don't know what to do because I feel it getting worse and worse. Yeah, I mean I find public transport really stressful in a way, especially being on the tube because it's quite getting warmer so it's just really airless. But I think the majority of it, because my life is just so focused around work right now, the majority of it is focused around work as well. Not really, I don't know. I mean everybody always has a bit of tension, a bit of anxiety, but I've never felt anything that's bad before. Yeah, yeah, because I do... Yeah. I'm pretty much down, like, don't enjoy being around this my day at all because i'm just so worried about everything um and i find that even when i'm not like even at the weekends and stuff it's just the kind of like constant feeling of just being a bit down a bit unhappy um i don't know if that's like a question i can't really i can't really put a date on that at all sorry yeah i live with my parents just my parents um i don't know probably quite a lot on the friday's and saturday's just because that's kind of normal um um maybe i maybe i do have like a bit during the week when my parents obviously are retired so they just drink whenever they want so whenever they're having a glass of wine they'll offer it to me and like i guess i don't really keep track of it that much Probably, like, probably quite a lot on Friday or Saturday because it's usually going out. So maybe like, I probably go over my limit just on those days anyway. And then like, maybe a glass of wine during the week with dinner. Um, I try not to smoke, but I do occasionally, but I don't take it. I talk to my mum because she also suffers from, or she's suffered from, like, depression in the past. I didn't think that it was, that I was suffering from actual depression because it just seems to be manifesting as just stress the whole time. But I did talk to my mum about it, but I haven't sought any, she recommended that I come to the GP, but I haven't sought any other. Yeah, I think so. I've never done that before, but yeah. Yeah, I think so. That's great. I look forward to reading it. Okay, okay. Yeah. Okay, I'll call them up. Thank you so much. Have a good day. Bye."," Hi there, I'm Dr Smith from Babylon.

Nineteen years old OK Amanda, and how can I help you this <UNIN/> afternoon? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Right OK. I'm sorry to hear there's a lot going on there and I can, see why it's affecting you. Um, so you mentioned it's been going on for last three days, mainly the burning pain when you pass urine. Um, you said <UNSURE>you're</UNSURE> going to the toilet more often as well, that right? <UNSURE>Ohh and a</UNSURE> week, sorry <UNSURE>my</UNSURE> <UNIN/>. OK, uh. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> <UNIN/> <UNSURE>Are you noticing</UNSURE> any, anything in your urine, predominantly blood or um, discolouration of urine? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> OK, <UNSURE>uh</UNSURE> <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> of any kind of frank blood? I mean red blood at all, in your urine? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> <UNIN/> OK. Um, fine we'll we'll have to definitely explore that <UNSURE> in a little bit or </UNSURE> detail later on. Um, you also mentioned some tummy pain as well, can you tell me <UNSURE> a </UNSURE> bit more about that pain? OK. Um, can you describe it <UNIN/> crampy pain? Is it more of a burning pain? <UNSURE>OK.</UNSURE> <UNSURE>An aching</UNSURE> pain, OK. And does the pain move anywhere else? Does it move towards your back? Towards your sides? <UNIN/> OK, all right. Um, any other symptoms? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Nausea? Vomiting? OK. Any temperatures or fevers? OK, all right. And how are your bowels at the moment? Are your bowels working OK? OK, and <UNSURE> when,</UNSURE> when when you say you have problems, what kind of problems do you normally have? <UNSURE>Right.</UNSURE> <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> OK, all right but, <UNSURE>and you've noticed</UNSURE> no <UNSURE>new symptoms?</UNSURE> No, no, no new symptoms in your bowels? Uh. OK, all right. Um, and Amanda sometimes we have to ask quite sensitive questions as you can imagine. Um, uh, can I ask? Are you currently uh, are you currently sexually active? <UNSURE>At the moment?</UNSURE> OK, and um, have you <UNSURE>noticed</UNSURE> any other discharge from down below? So, from from the front passage? <UNIN/> OK. Have you, do you use any form of contraception? The pill. What kind of pill is it? Is it combined pill or the mini-pill? OK, fine. Um, when was the last time you had um, unprotected sex? If you don't <UNSURE>want</UNSURE> me asking. <UNSURE>Yeah, exactly.</UNSURE> Yep, a <UNSURE>week ago</UNSURE>, OK all right. <UNIN/> What I'm trying get at is whether um, uh there's any chance you could be pregnant at all. Uh, I know you're on the pill, but um we're we, nonetheless we do have to ask. <UNSURE>Um</UNSURE> when was your <UNSURE>last</UNSURE>, when was your last period? Two weeks ago OK, all right. Just something for <UNSURE>us</UNSURE>, to bear in mind, if your symptoms don't get any better OK, um. Fine, in terms of your general health otherwise at the moment are you, uh eating and drinking OK? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> <UNIN/> Sure, well thanks for sharing with me. Um, so, I, I don't think <UNSURE> it's</UNSURE> <UNIN/> is related to your symptoms, I think it probably just <UNSURE>pure</UNSURE> pure coincidence, um. But, uh, you know I do strongly advise you to you know, um, make it a regular habit if you can. Um, just for your, just for your general health moving forwards, OK? Um, fine. Moving on, in terms of your health otherwise, do you have any other medical conditions <UNIN/> , apart from the IBS, is there anything else I should be aware of? No, OK great. And what about any medications that you take on a regular basis, apart from the, um, combined pill? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> <UNSURE>was it</UNSURE>, yeah OK. OK, and <UNSURE>is</UNSURE> that for the cramps, the crampy pain? Yeah OK, and do you have any allergy to any medications? <UNIN/> OK, OK, OK. <UNSURE>Ritib</UNSURE>, OK sure, I'll make a note of that. Um, in terms of family history, any history of problems with the bladder or the kidneys? No, or <UNIN/> <UNSURE>generally</UNSURE> anything else, good. And socially, tell me a bit more about your home situation, who's at home with you? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> <UNIN/> Very good. Great, and what are you studying at university? English, OK good, and how are you enjoying your course? <UNSURE>Good</UNSURE>. Very <UNSURE>good</UNSURE>, very <UNSURE>good</UNSURE>, good. Um, in terms of smoking and alcohol, do you, do you participate in either? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> O <UNSURE>K</UNSURE> OK, what, what's made you have your first joint last week? <UNSURE>Was </UNSURE> <UNIN/> OK. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Sure, uh, and obviously as your doctor I'm here to look after you so yeah I I would strongly recommend you, you know, to avoid if you can. Great, um, fine so, at this stage I wouldn't normally examine you, but I think based on your story I think, um, you know, uh, I'm reassured. <UNSURE>But</UNSURE> the fact <UNSURE>that I, I</UNSURE> I think it's, um, probably just a simple what <UNSURE>we'd</UNSURE> say <UNSURE>a</UNSURE> UTI or a cystitis, bladder infection. Uh, you know you haven't got any other symptoms that, suggest to me that there's anything to worry about, so things like fevers and back pain. Um, would be more worrying for me to hear. Um, so <UNSURE>it's</UNSURE> something we can treat quite readily with antibiotics. Um, so we've got a choice of two antibiotics something called Trimethoprim or, Nitrofurantoin which is a three day course. <UNSURE>And</UNSURE> normally they're usually quite effective, um, for your symptoms. It's probably worth giving us a urine sample today as well if you can, so we can send it off to the lab. And see exactly what's going on there. Um, start the antibiotics, make sure you're well hydrated, drink plenty of fluids. Um, if you are having some pain, simple Paracetamol, um, would probably be advisable. Um, we'll see what the urine sample shows. Um, and if it is indeed positive, we'll know which antibiotics are the right ones. Um, but if things <UNSURE>still</UNSURE> are still not getting any better next week come back and see me, and we can have another look again. <UNSURE>So if</UNSURE> <UNIN/> <UNSURE>I'll give yeah no it's a well uh so</UNSURE> yeah good question, so I will give you <UNIN/> I will organise uh for you to come in, and drop off a sample <UNSURE>at one of</UNSURE> our practices, um which we can test there and then, <UNSURE>at the urine</UNSURE> <UNIN/> <UNSURE>and send it off to the</UNSURE> lab <UNSURE>uh</UNSURE> we can back in touch with you with the results. OK, do bear in mind those symptoms I mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting. If you have any of those give me a call, OK? <UNSURE>All right</UNSURE>, OK. Have a good day.

Um, it's not happened before and I'm bit worried. I've <UNSURE>uh it</UNSURE> quite hurts when I kind of pee. Um, and yeah it's like I'm going to the toilet a lot more, um. And it's really, like I can't, like go to uni properly. I'm just like constantly looking for the toilet. Um, <UNSURE>and</UNSURE> it kind of hurts sometimes when I'm, like in at the bottom of my tummy as well. Uh, yeah <UNSURE>it's</UNSURE> been going on for a little bit longer than three days I think actually, maybe just under a week. Um. Sorry no I <UNIN/> didn't explain it properly before, um yeah <UNSURE>no I</UNSURE> it's been going on for about just under a week. Um, and yeah I <UNIN/> notice a sort of burning, stinging, when I when I go to the toilet, yeah. Um, I think, well today I noticed, um, that it was like a bit pink. The, the urine. Yeah, I think just today <UNIN/>. Um, I think it was <UNIN/> probably but I don't know it was pink so. Yeah it's kind of at the bottom of my tummy, um, uh mainly when I go to the loo, I think that's when it's worse. Um, I wouldn't describe it as crampy I don't think it's like a period pain, it's a bit different, it's, <UNSURE>it's</UNSURE> hard to say, an achey pain I suppose. <UNSURE>No</UNSURE>, no, no. No, no nausea vomiting. Um no, no not that I've noticed. Uh I, I usually have a bit of problems with my bowels anyway, so I don't think it's any, different, from what it usually is. Um, I think I have, um, IBS, um, so I just kinda pass, uh, my bowels like quite, quite a lot. Um, and sometimes it's quite, it's quite variable like sometimes it's a bit softer, sometimes it's a bit, <UNIN/> sorry if it's a bit disgusting but like, sometimes it's a bit <UNSURE>uh harder</UNSURE> and kind of hard to predict.

OK. <UNSURE>Sure</UNSURE> <UNIN/>. No, nope. Apart from the pill, um, I take, um, something for the IBS as well. Um it begins with an M, it's pretty hard to pronounce like <UNIN/> something <UNIN/>, maybe. Yeah, yeah that's it. Yeah, yeah that's right. Yeah, yeah. Um, yeah I think there was an antibiotic, um, called <UNIN/> Clindamycin <UNSURE>mycin</UNSURE> <UNIN/>. <UNSURE>Then I took</UNSURE> like <UNIN/> something and yeah that, that didn't, go too well, with me. No, no. Um, so I am living in halls at the moment, uh <UNSURE>at</UNSURE> uni um, so uh, uh, I'm just living with a flatmate I suppose, um.

Hi, I'm Dr. Jacob and welcome to Babylon. How are you doing? OK Peter, so just before we <UNIN/>, is it alright if you could confirm your full name for me please? OK, and your date of birth? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. And uh, and <UNIN/> um, what's your email address? That's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location, and we can have a confidential conversation. Alright. So, you've mentioned that you're not having much of an appetite and energy lately. I'm sorry to hear that. Could you tell me a bit more about it please? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> So, so you, are you telling me that your, your mood's low? Is that what you're trying to tell me? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> your mood, would you say you're depressed? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> it's a tough one isn't it? Because we don't want to actually say <UNSURE>Uh do you like </UNSURE> your work? Do you like your work? You like your work. OK. And um you, and how are things at home? Alright? Are you having any kind of stress <UNSURE>at home</UNSURE>? And have you lost any weight? OK, right. So you mentioned that you've lost your appetite for a while now. So how long are we talking about? We talking about two months, three months, or six months <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> ? <UNIN/> <UNSURE>and a half </UNSURE> months ago. But you said your weight loss is much longer than that? Sorry, could you <UNIN/>, I couldn't hear you. What did you say, your weight loss, how long? <UNIN/> at least six months, would you say? <UNIN/> six months. And roughly how much have you lost? Just approximately. So about a stone, yeah? Six months, OK. <UNIN/> OK. <UNIN/> , OK. Right, OK. So, just a few more questions. It might seem a bit awkward, but it's quite relevant. OK? So, how are your bowels? Are they OK? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Yeah, um, your bowels.  How's your toilet? <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE>. So, you're not going to the toilet? <UNIN/> you are going. Like, to be very more <UNIN/> specific, you don't have any diarrhoea? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> OK, so there's <UNIN/> blood in the poo no mucus nothing of that sort? <UNSURE>Just now</UNSURE>, you mentioned nausea. Have you been ever sick with it? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> OK, well just <UNSURE>the nausea</UNSURE>, OK. Is there any particular <UNSURE>foods</UNSURE> that make you nauseous? OK. So you can't think of any real.... Do you suffer from acid reflux? OK, OK. You also mentioned that you're feeling short of breath so <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> yeah is there any cough? OK. Yeah. Is it like in closed spaces? So, how far can you walk and when you start feeling short of breath? So <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> how far can you walk with no shortness of breath? <UNIN/> Walk, you start with walk. Do you feel short of <UNSURE>breath</UNSURE>let's start this way, do you feel short of <UNIN/> uh breath when you walk at all? Right. You so you can walk about a mile and you don't feel short of breath at all. OK, so just explain a bit more just make myself clear about the lift thing.  So you said you're short of breath when you're in the lift? <UNIN/> <UNSURE>described them</UNSURE> like palpitations to me, yeah? So that's what you're, you're feeling your own heartbeat. Yeah, OK. You get any chest pains with it? <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE>. OK, no chest pains. OK. Alright. Fine. So, what we need to do, um, just before that, um, just a few more things. Uh, any <UNIN/> any past medical history you'd like to share with me today? <UNIN/> Sorry you had thyroid problems. Ohh yeah, underactive thyroid, yes. Yep. Yeah, you're taking thyroxine? <UNSURE>Are you</UNSURE> using it every day? Why is that? OK, so is that, so all these things are since you've stopped taking the thyroxine? When was your last blood test? OK, so you've not had a blood test. Right, OK. It could, you know, generally for you know <UNIN/> for underactive thyroids what symptoms you've said um <UNIN/> it's the opposite that usually happens, yeah. It's for overactive thyroid like you can feel a bit like the <UNIN/> racing of your heart beat and all so I'm not quite clear on what picture we are having here. Yeah? I think a general set of bloods is a good <UNIN/> , good start. So what we look at, because you're not, you're not having the umph, aren't you? You're like, you're just <UNIN/> feeling a bit, you know low and things like that, right? Well, um, and weak and things like that.

You <UNIN/> come into one of our clinics in central London, that's one option, and then the the GP there who examines you can then decide on how urgent the blood tests and things are going to be.

I'm going to type up what my thought process is and what kind of test I think you need in the notes for this appointment, so you could show that to them at reception. Um, I'll be asking for something called thick and thin blood films, to check for malaria.

Um, the other thing I'd like you to do, is maybe consider taking some time off work. OK, because if the headache is due to stress from work. Um, maybe having a week off if you self-certify, that might help with things. And I'd also like you to explore, counselling options as well so there's, a counselling service in your area, that I can give you the link for, for you to self-refer. I'd like you <UNSURE>to</UNSURE>, <UNIN/>, OK I'd like you to try that. Um, what, we're gonna do is, we'll have a follow-up in a week's time. As well as those two things, other things I'd like you to do, is to try and ensure that you're having a minimum of seven, eight hours sleep at night, every night. <UNSURE>And you're drinking a</UNSURE> minimum of, um, one point five to two litres uh, of water or fluids a day, and that's not including coffee or tea. All right, because sometimes dehydration and you know uh, fatigue can be causes of headaches as well. Um. Yeah, so <UNSURE>it</UNSURE>, that, that, that is um, you know, we need to rule those things out. Um, let's, let's try that. OK. Um, and let's have a follow-up appointment, if we're finding that things are not getting better, we might need to arrange some blood tests or um, look at uh, other possibilities, but, we'll try that in the first instance. Um, if anything changes in the meantime, or you get worried or things get worse. Feel free, have a lower threshold for ringing us back and <UNSURE>we can</UNSURE> book you an appointment, and we can reassess the situation. OK, no problem. So there'll be a summary of all of this in the notes. Um, and I'll also leave a link, to some of the danger signs of symptoms of headaches, in the notes. If you can read through that in your own time, that will just help you to have a bit more, control over what's going on and understanding of what, what, what kind of things, should trigger you contacting another doctor. No problem, OK. So we'll, we'll touch base in a week's time, with me <UNSURE>or</UNSURE>, myself or one of the other doctors, and we <UNIN/>, we'll take it from there, OK. Brilliant, OK then, all right. Take care then, <UNSURE>all the best</UNSURE>. Bye bye.","Hiya. Hi there. My name's <UNSURE>Atan</UNSURE>. Sure. So, it's <UNSURE>Ayrton Warren</UNSURE>. Um, and my date of birth, is the sixteenth of May, nineteen, eighty two. I am, yes. Um, so I kind of woke up this morning, um, and I've just got this, really horrible pain on the left side of my head. Um, a real kind of headachy feeling. Yeah, it woke me up, um, quite early this morning. Um, probably around, five thirty ish. Um, I normally get up at about, seven o'clock. Yes, it is. Um, I mean uh, I've, had a bit of a history with headaches, but nothing as severe as this before. Um, not so much on the one side, it tends to be, a bit of a cluster at the front of my head in a way. Um, but this time it's just kind of more prominent on the left side which, I've never really had it, normally they kind of spread across the front of my head. Uh, no. No. Um, it, I'm a little bit sensitive it just, it kind of, makes my eyes a little bit sore, but nothing that I can't really handle. Um, not really, like <UNIN/>. When I first got up this morning, my head felt a bit dizzy, but that's kind of subsided now, and I, seems to, be fine. Uh, no. They haven't. Um, work's kind of, um, a bit stressful at the moment. I've got a lot going on. Um, yeah, I just seem to have like, a lot of, kind of, a backlog of work that I need to go through at the moment. So, I've kind of, been, doing a lot of late nights as well. Uh, <UNSURE>for</UNSURE> probably about a couple of months now. Um, I'm not, like moody, I'm not angry or, um, like I get a bit frustrated during the day. Um, but <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, it kind of, um, ebbs and flows every now and then, but, yeah. Um, I've had, um, so I had, like anxiety for about, two years now, and I've been on, uh, Sertraline for, a while. Yes. <UNIN/>, no, not necessarily at work, sometimes I do feel a bit anxious. Um, but I, I kind of just, uh, the panic of not being able to get my work done on time. Um, but other than that, I, I don't, feel, um, massively anxious. No. Um, when I lay down, like, uh, it kind of feels a little bit sore at first, um and it takes me a while to get comfortable. Um, so yeah, at the beginning it does, but then again that's just kind of, um, <UNSURE>soothes</UNSURE> a little bit. Uh, yeah, I would say so. Um, I've taken some Paracetamol. Um, not really, no. No that's it, just Paracetamol. Uh, none. No. No. Um, no, there's nothing. My parents, uh, my mum's had a history of anxiety as well but, no kind of like physical illnesses or anything like that. Um, no, other, other than Sertraline and having taken, um, Paracetamol this morning, uh, nothing else. Not that I'm aware of, no. Um, I live with my partner. No. Uh, I have a cat. Um, so normally I, try to go running at least three times a week. Um, it's OK, um, it's nothing, <UNSURE>it's</UNSURE> nothing <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> um, really healthy, um, but it's fine. I <UNSURE>wouldn't say</UNSURE> unhealthy. Sure. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. Ohh right, <UNSURE>O</UNSURE>. OK. OK. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Yeah, that'd <UNSURE>be</UNSURE>. OK. OK. Ohh <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE>, I didn't realise that. OK. Yeah, <UNSURE>the</UNSURE>, that, that sounds brilliant. Thank you so much for your help. OK. That's perfect. Thank you so much for your help. OK. Thank you. Yeah, I'll book an appointment, in, um, yeah, in that time. <UNSURE>Bye</UNSURE>. Thank you, and you. Bye.",data/Primock-57/audio/day2_consultation10_doctor.wav,data/Primock-57/audio/day2_consultation10_patient.wav,579.42,579.42,"Hello, good afternoon. Hi there, this is Dr Dean Meza from GP at hand. Hi, Anthony. So could I have your, before we start, can I have your full name and date of birth if that's possible? That's great. Thank you for that. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak? Okay, great. So how can I help you today? Sure, okay. And did the pain wake you up? What time did it wake you up? And what time do you normally get up? Right. Okay. Is the headache still present now? Okay. Have you had this kind of pain before? Okay, all right. And can I just Do you have any neck stiffness at all? Okay. And do you have any fever? Alright. How are you with bright lights at the moment? Do you feel sensitive to bright lights? Okay. Okay. And can I just double check, are you feeling nauseous at all? Okay. And can I just double check, does anyone in your family have any migraines or anything like that, have they been diagnosed with migraines? Okay. And are you under any particular stress at the moment? Right, okay. And how long has that been the case for? Okay. How would you say your mood is? Okay. Do you have, have you ever been diagnosed with anxiety or depression or stress in the past? Okay, are you taking any sort of treatment at the moment? Okay, and how do you feel in terms of anxiety at the moment? Do you feel anxious at the moment? Okay, all right. Now, sorry to ask this, just need to ask this for anyone suffering from migraine. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or hurting yourself? Okay, so would you say ultimately it's better when you lie down or you not? Okay, and in terms of this headache since this morning, have you taken anything for it yet? Has that helped? Okay, taking anything else at all? Okay, do you have any other illnesses at all? have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure have you ever had your blood pressure checked okay and are there any illnesses in your family okay all right and are you on any medication do you have any allergies to any medication okay and are you living by yourself at the moment or with someone else okay are you a smoker okay and do you have any pets at home okay and can i just double check how much exercise would you do normally a week okay and what's your diet like okay all right now in terms of this headache obviously i haven't been able to examine you or see you directly but it sounds like it might be one of two things it could be an element of what we call tension headache that's one possibility and what makes that more likely is the fact that you've been under some pressure and you have a history of anxiety in the past okay the other possibility is migraine as well. Okay. And the fact what makes that more likely is the fact that it's on one side and that you've got some sensitivity to light. Okay. So what what I think we can do is I think we can give you some generic pain relief that would be the appropriate first step for migraine type headaches. Okay. So I'll tell you this in a second. And the other thing that I was going to suggest is we maybe look explore things to try and decrease the stress from work. So the medication wise, the thing that we start off first line if someone had migraine was to start ibuprofen and the dosages of ibuprofen can be a bit more than the normal dosages of ibuprofen. So that's one thing we can start. You can keep on taking paracetamol as well if you like, but the ibuprofen is actually more effective for migraine. And yeah, so the guidelines have changed recently. We used to give paracetamol as first line but now it's ibuprofen and aspirin. That's the thing. The other thing I'd like you to do is maybe consider taking some time off work. Okay, because if the headache is due to stress from work, maybe having a week off if you self-certify that might help with things. And I'd also like you to explore counselling options as well. So there's a counselling service in your area that I can give you the link for you to self-refer. I'd like you to try that. What we're going to do is we'll have a follow-up in a week's time as well as those two things. Other things I'd like you to do is to try and ensure that you're having a minimum of 70 hours sleep at night, every night, a minimum of 1.5 to 2 litres of water or fluids a day and that's not including coffee or tea alright because sometimes dehydration and you know fatigue can be caused of headaches as well yeah so that that is you know we need to rule those things out um let's let's try that okay um let's have a follow up appointment if we're finding that things are not getting better we might need to arrange some blood tests or um look at other possibilities but we'll try that in the first instance um if anything changes in the meantime or you get worried or things get worse feel free have a low threshold for ringing us back and booking an appointment and we can reassess the situation okay no problem okay so we'll we'll touch base in a week's time with me myself or one of the other doctors and we could we'll take it from there okay brilliant okay then all right take care then yes bye bye","Hiya.

And I <UNSURE>don't know</UNSURE> what's causing them. I have googled it and, um, nothing's coming up, so I thought I'd come and speak to you about it. So, it started with, feeling very tired, but for a couple of days, and then I get back to normal. And then I started losing feeling, in my hands and arms. I get a weird sensation like, uh, I guess, pins and needles. And. Yeah, that's correct. My right hand. Yes. Yes, that's fine. Uh, the pins and needles are in the hand, but I feel like my arm is getting weaker, but it only lasts few days and then goes back to normal. So, it's very weird. Uh, my, colleague said, I'm walking slightly differently to normal. And again, it's only for three days, or three or four days. Yes. Um, I generally feel tired, and weak. And, sometimes I feel nauseous, and I don't feel like I want to do anything. Yes. <UNSURE>Yeah</UNSURE>, so, at the same time I get my arm symptoms, my leg feels weaker. No, it has not.

Yeah. They checked my diabetes, my blood pressure and my, cholesterol, and the doctor said it was all OK. No. I take an aspirin, seventy five milligrams, once a day, but that's, because of something I read on the internet. I think it's, meant to reduce your risk of stroke and heart attack. Yes I took, I started to <UNIN/>, taking it after my, father had his operation, but that wasn't the doctor telling me. No, I haven't. Yes, I am. Uh, I'm, uh, I'm actually a doctor. Yes.

But <UNIN/> let's continue anyway. Uh, OK. Let's start again. So how can I help you sir? OK. No, no problem. I'm happy to help. Um whereabouts in your skin is it affected? Yeah. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> No no, OK. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> I'm <UNSURE>certain </UNSURE> this is obviously affecting you. And uh we'll try our very best to get get this sorted out for you. Um, have you had anything like this before in the past? OK. OK. Did it help? <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE>. OK. Do you remember the name of the cream you bought? OK, steroid, OK. <UNIN/> um <UNIN/> would you say these symptoms are very similar to your eczema symptoms, or different? OK. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Yes. No. <UNIN/> Well OK. That's <UNIN/> so you mentioned the itchiness. Um you also mentioned it's been quite sore. Um have you, have you noticed any uh bleeding or discharge from your skins? OK. You've not, haven't uh seen any other uh pus or blood, coming out of your skin. No. And you mentioned it all started three days ago. Are you, four days ago. Are you aware of any triggers, or anything that you may have done, that may have caused your symptoms to start? So for example, have you changed your uh shower gel, any clothing? Have you been around anyone else? Mm. Mm. No no, OK. That's OK. Um Fine, so just to resummarize. For the last four days, you've had very itchy skin, very sore skin all over your body, mainly your chest. And did you also mention your arms and legs as well? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> OK. <UNIN/> anything on your face at all? On your face? No, OK. And apart from this, any other symptoms have you noticed? For example, have you noticed any temperature or fevers? Itchy. OK. So your, your bowels are working OK? Your chest is OK? No cough, no breathing difficulties? You're passing urine OK. OK, alright. Um It's always good to know. So, I mean, do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms? Any ideas, as to what could be causing your symptoms? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> OK. That's OK. So um, normally at this stage I like to examine you. Um To see the rash itself, to see exactly what type of rash it is. But from what you've told me, you mentioned it's, you've got some dry skin and some, uh cracked skin as well. Uh and has been very itchy. And so would your um Uh your your background of eczema. Um <UNSURE>So</UNSURE> Sorry to say, there's a couple of questions I wanted to ask you, which I completely forgot, my apologies. Um, apart from the eczema, do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of? OK. Not anymore, OK. And do you take any regular medications at the moment? No, OK. Do you have any allergies to anything? <UNIN/> sorry I said do you have any allergies to anything? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Hello? <UNIN/> can you hear me? That's alright I think it <UNIN/>. Uh do you have any allergies at all? No, OK. Um and tell me about your um uh your situation at home. Who do you live with? OK. And what do you do for work? OK. Uh no no no that's <UNIN/>, that's absolutely fine. Um just a couple of questions I want to ask you, which can sometimes affect your symptoms, is, do you smoke at all? No. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol? OK. OK. OK I've got to say, at this stage I've got to say <UNIN/> this sound quality is not uh great. But I will continue because we've come this far. Um So um, based on everything you mentioned <UNSURE>Sarah </UNSURE>, <UNIN/> I do wonder whether this is a flare-up of your eczema. Um The reason being that you said it was quite itchy. Um it's mainly affecting your chest and your back. Um and uh, having looked at your skin, uh the the the rash does appear quite familiar. Um you mentioned <UNIN/> using steroid creams, yesterday. Um from the pharmacy. I wonder whether giving you a stronger prescription of a <UNIN/> of a steroid may be beneficial. Uh, which I'm happy to prescribe to you today. As well as, I'm going to give you something, some emollients, which helps to moisturize the skin. Um which <UNIN/> use in the bath and shower. And it's definitely worth um using that for the first seven to ten days. Uh before we make the decision on whether it's working or not. Um it's also worth um using antihistamines, which you can sometimes buy over counter. Things like Loratadine or Piriton, which can help the itchiness of your skin. And uh, um it's also worth keeping a diary of any triggers which are affecting your symptoms, anything you wear or anything you use, in terms of shower gels or soap. Because if that's causing your symptoms, then we need to have a discussion about an eczema CU. Ohh, could you say that again, sorry? OK. <UNIN/> OK. So it's something for you to think about. <UNIN/> you can get different types of antihistamines. I can give you something a little bit stronger today as well. Um, something like Fexofenadine, which I can give to you today. It's definitely worth trying, and it's not going to do you any harm. Um but I <UNIN/> think using the steroids and the emollients, um on a regular basis Uh over the next week to ten days, should hopefully <UNIN/> control your symptoms. But do come back and see me next week, if things don't get better. OK? Um do you have any questions for me? OK. Well I wish you all the best. Thank you. Have a good day.","Hello.

Okay, do you do much in the way of exercise? Okay, who's at home with you? Okay, are you coping okay at the moment? Yeah, okay. Do you smoke at all? yes and do you drink much alcohol okay alright um so norm at least i said i kind of proceed to examination um but um based on your story um i wonder whether you may may have a migraine migraine type headache it sounds um very classical of that nature the the the headache on one side throbbing nature the nausea vomiting um sensitive to bright lights um i'm reassured that you don't have anything more serious such as meningitis or indeed brain cancer i know that was one of your big worries of yours initially um yeah well i hope that put your mind at ease and certainly this is the second migraine you've had in the space of a month um so i think moving forwards there's a couple of options i think keeping a headache diary would be quite important and to see exactly what's triggering this headache but we should also try and treat your headaches today some strong painkillers will be advisable so you know think about paracetamol or even codeine and some anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen and naproxen how does that sound to you um and you know if your headaches were to become more persistent then we can maybe think about giving you some medications that will stop your headaches in the first place something prophylactic medicines then we can have discussion next time I'll see you next week perhaps okay now a couple of things i want you to think about is you know if your symptoms aren't getting better in the next two three days or indeed they're getting worse i'd like you to come back and see me straight away if possible so if your headache is getting worse and not responding to medications or your neck pain is getting worse or you're developing weakness in your arms and legs or your vision then i want you to come back and see me straight away okay does that sound all okay great any questions for me okay","Hello. Oh, I've just got a terrible headache since midday. I'm on the left side, it's just making me feel so ill. I just feel like I need to vomit. Well, you know, I've noticed some zigzag lines in my vision a few minutes before the headache started. My vision blurred. You know, it's just, I yeah, pain's just horrible. It's just making me feel so unwell. I don't know really, it just happened. Yeah, I guess it's, yeah, I guess it's throbbing on that left side. No, but it's worse when I move. Well, like if I lean forward or like move my head or neck, yeah, the headache gets worse. I'm just really worried like I've just been googling and like I've read, you know, if your head gets headache gets worse when you move, it could be a sign of brain cancer. It feels like it's on both. Yeah, well I'm wearing sunglasses right now, it's just, you know, light's really hurting my eyes. Yeah, I vomited twice. No, I don't feel feverish. No, I haven't noticed anything like that. Um, not really prone to them, no, but I did have a similar headache a few weeks ago. Just similar. couple of days um yeah i had to take painkillers and had to sort of go to bed and rest and a couple days off work and work in the fashion industry and you know they're wondering what's going on like having to take sick days i have to get back to work today but you know what if it is a brain tumour what's going to happen with my future and my career you know yeah i'm really worried about this never had headaches like this before like why should i get them now no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no I've not been diagnosed. My mum has an underactive thyroid as well. No. I take the pill, microgynon, at three months. Yeah, it's really stressful actually, having problems with people at work, you know, managers putting a lot of pressure on me to deliver and oh yeah, it's not a good time. I don't feel down, just feel a bit stressed. Nothing really. No. I live on my own. Fine. Thank you. I was so worried that I had cancer and now you say migraine. Yeah, I guess my mum had similar symptoms to me and yeah, it does make sense. Okay, that sounds good. Okay, okay, doctor, that's great. No, thank you."," Hello. Hello there, it's Dr. Seed here. How can I help you this afternoon? I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a bit more about the headache? Mm-hmm. And is it moving anywhere else at all? Okay, is that when you move your neck? Okay. came on and your vision has been blurry as well is that right is that on both eyes or just left left eye both eyes okay have you any difficulty with seeing bright lights at all well let's see okay and you mentioned that you felt quite nauseous have you vomited at all Did you do anything that made it better? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. or be knocked on the head okay all right um and and you're feeling otherwise okay so for example your um uh your breathing is okay you're not feeling breathless or no okay um do you have any other medical history i should be aware of no so for example have you had if anyone told you've had and is that mainly for conception or is that for something else okay all right that's something we may need to have a little discussion about today as well um uh well my next question was examination. But based on your story, I wonder whether you may have a migraine-type headache. It sounds very classical of that nature, the headache on one side, the throbbing nature, the of options i think keeping a headache diary would be quite important to see exactly what's triggering these headaches but we should also try and treat your headaches today some strong painkillers would be advisable so you know i think about paracetamol or even cocodamol um and some anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen and naproxen how does that sound to you um and uh you know if your headaches were to become more persistent."," Hello.

Um, it depends on the lighting, so it may not be possible. But <UNSURE>the</UNSURE> next thing I'd like you to try and do is just, to get you to squeeze the tip of your finger. And then let me see how quickly the redness come back. OK, so if you can see what I'm doing now. My finger's come, right behind the screen, I'm squeezing it, OK. <UNIN/>, just watch me first, it's all right, just watch me first. Yeah, I'm, I'm squeezing it. And then you can see, that, it goes, pale and then it goes back to the normal red colour, OK. So if I can get you just to put your finger up to the, your camera. And then with the other hand, just try and squeeze it, and <UNSURE>see</UNSURE><INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. OK, perfect, that's great. Thank you so much. The last thing I'd like to do, is I'd like <UNIN/>, to <UNIN/>, try and have a look down your throat. OK. Are, are you doing this consultation via, um, a phone or a <UNIN/>, laptop? A phone? <UNIN/>, sorry, say that again. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> OK, <UNIN/>, OK. So if you, if you, um, position your device up above your head, put your head back, mouth open wide, and let me see if I can have a <UNIN/>. That's, <UNSURE>fantastic</UNSURE>. And say ah. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Perfect. Thank you for that. Excellent. OK. Last thing, is if I can get you to feel inside your neck. Just on the sides here, OK, um, by your Adam's apple. Tell me whether you can feel any enlarged glands or not. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. OK. All right. Um. Now, um, uh, <UNIN/>. Sorry, I've forgotten your name. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Doris, OK Doris. Um, so, so Doris, um, what, what I think we need to do, is um. This sounds like you might have a chest infection. OK. If you're coughing up blood, and you're feeling your heart racing. Um. Uh, I think, you need to be examined today, someone needs to listen to your chest. And, um, maybe check your blood pressure as well, check that, you're stable. I have to say examining you now, from what limited, examination I could do online. You're, everything does seem to be OK, in terms of, you, you don't seem acutely unstable. However, if you've got, this kind of pain, um, when taking a deep breath in and you're coughing up blood. We do, do, we do need to assess you to figure out whether you have <UNSURE>a</UNSURE> Pneumonia or chest infection. And um, that would involve someone listening to your chest with a stethoscope, and you may need um, an antibiotic. Uh, there's one thing I need to ask you. Have you been, on any long-haul flight recently? No, OK. Have you ever had any clots in your legs, or clots in your lung? Blood clots? No, OK. Anyone in the family have that? No, OK. All right. Um, what I think we'll do is um, we'll arrange for you to get reviewed in a clinic today. OK. Um, I would like someone to listen to your chest, and check your blood pressure. And to, to recheck your pulse as well. Just make <UNSURE>sure</UNSURE>, and check your temperature, make sure all those parameters <UNSURE>are</UNSURE> OK. You may well need an antibiotic, OK. Um, do you have any allergies to any antibiotics? No, OK. Um, I, I'm not, I'm gonna, not, I'm not going to prescribe anything for you now, because I think you need to have that, basic assessment first. Um, before we proceed to the next step. But the, that's what I would predict the next step might be. Um, I'm going to leave the number in the notes for this appointment, for you to ring our support team. And then, they will, book you in for a face-to-face appointment with one of our GPs today. And <UNSURE>then</UNSURE>, they'll do that assessment, and then we'll take it from there, OK. Um, uh, given the, the way in which you uh, have presented now. Just one day, with a fever and, this slight pain, <UNIN/>, concurrent with the, the blood in the, the, the flem. That's not usually how lung cancer is <UNSURE>presented</UNSURE>. It's more insidious, over a longer period of time, with other symptoms. Um, however, we might need to get some investigations to exclude that. It depends on the examination finding, when we see you. All right. <UNIN/>, are you worried about lung cancer? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. Sure, of course yeah. So, just remind me how old you are again. I'm sorry. Forty five, OK. It's something we do need to be cognisant of, OK. Um, and, we may end up having to do a follow-up chest X-ray, if things don't settle down. But at the moment, it, it seems more like a chest infection, rather than a lung cancer. Yeah, that, that is good to know, yeah, so that's, 'cause that's easier to treat. But we still need to make sure that things are OK because, chest infections can become nasty as well. <UNSURE>It</UNSURE> can lead to infection inside the body, <UNIN/>, we want to avoid that as well. So, let's get you checked out today, and hopefully we can put your mind to rest, <UNSURE>and</UNSURE> get you on the right course of treatment. All right, you're welcome. All right, take care then. All the best. Bye.","Hello. Lovely to meet you. Uh my name is, Tracy Chapman, and, um, my date of birth is. <UNSURE>God</UNSURE> <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. <UNIN/>, I'm forty five.

You ever smoked or been exposed to asbestos? You know. Okay. And this so just going back to the your symptoms of shortness of breath with a cough it's a dry cough no you're not coughing up any phlegm um do you do you have and you say you don't have any chest pain as such um are you taking any medications okay are you allergic to any medications peanuts okay and you mentioned that your mother had lung cancer um any other family history feverish hot cold sweaty okay and in general do you sorry yeah okay and in general would you say you're feeling you're you're beginning to to feel better worse or sort of staying the same okay so i just really need to ask any other sort of risk factors that you may have so um no sort of significant weight loss or unexplained weight loss any rashes or anything and you no no okay so i would ask to examine you now but i i don't know if i could sort of look inside your throat at least to see if there's a probably there's oh no well no it's okay i might think about doing it have you got any lumps or bumps around your neck that you can feel not the no okay and and so finally you you were talking about i mean it sounds to me that um you've been a little bit up and down sore throat developed to dry cough and you are slightly short of breath but not too overly concerningly short of breath well i would say we're just coming to the end of the consultation now as is if you feel significantly worse um and if you get more short of breath or sudden change in your breathlessness or breathlessness that you are concerned about then i would advise you to see medical attention again see a gp and actually see somebody physically but i think for now i can sort of try and reassure you that if this clears up as i expected would so expect this to sort of be getting better in the next four or five days if it's not please get in touch with the medical professional again and i would expect it to and so therefore i wouldn't be concerned about tuberculosis your concerns about lung cancer was that the other thing you were concerned about yeah so again if you're not getting better please see somebody again i've just got four seconds now so nice talking to you and we've got to we've got to tidy up yeah okay so and i'll provide you with a sick note just to give you a few more days off work and paracetamol lots of fluids and rest up and as i say if you're not feeling better please get in touch okay thank you","Yeah, yes, I can. Can you hear me? Hey, my name is Vincent. Uh, 9th of May 2016. Sorry. Yeah, I am. Yeah, yes, I am. Yeah, so I have a call. I've been having a cough and a sore throat for about a week and it's been causing me problems. I've had to stay away from work for about three or four of those days because of how bad it is. Yes. Uh, the sore throats came first and then after a day or two the cough. No, it's very dry. Okay. Well, I mean, you know, you know how we all are. Once this happens, you Google it and it seems. It could be all kinds of bad things. It could be a cold or flu obviously, but it could be a tuberculosis, it could be cancer, always comes up. So it would be good if none of those. Well yeah, so reassurance, so hopefully some sense that it's not anything too serious, but also if there's anything you can prescribe me to make it better or any advice or maybe even a sick note. So if I need to stay at work, well I can work from home. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, No, no, that's the only one, just lung cancer from my mother.

No, so I haven't always lived in the UK, like, so I was born in the US and moved over about 12 years ago, but it was always really just to Europe, nowhere too exotic. Yeah, so a little bit feverish at first, so the first three or so days of this, but then the fever's gone away. So I was just gonna say also had a bit of a headache, but like headaches that come and go rather, but like right now it's fine. So it's like it's up and down, so so let's see.

So you mentioned that So are you able to walk up a flight of stairs, for example? Any history of clots on your legs or your lungs, so these are DDTs or PEs, no one in your family has had those, clots on the legs or the lungs. Your mother had lung cancer, do you smoke, of any significant illnesses when running in family okay and you say you're feeling you're beginning to feel better about that but you haven't you haven't lost any weight that you are concerned about, then I would advise you to see a GP and actually see somebody physically. people.

would set off the ringing in the ear.

See you later."," Hi there, good morning. I'm Dr. Dean Mirza from Babylon. Hi, can you hear me okay? Okay, great. Well, nice to see you this morning. Before we start your appointment, could I confirm your full name and date of birth, please? ear is fine okay so you've had ringing difficulty hearing in your left ear and feeling slightly sick and that's been doesn't clean out the wax, it pushes it back in. Alright, the first thing that we need to do is we need to get someone to have a look inside your ear, okay, and just exclude the simple things. The simple things might be wax, someone might have impacted wax blocking the tube going into the eardrum which can lead to muffled hearing. If that's the case, let's get your ear checked out i think that would be the most reading about it okay and often that that awareness of what it is and what the treatment options are and there are limited options um that helps us in terms of conversation about what we do next if your area is clear okay so i'm going to paste a link to that and you can can read about that and what we'll do is we'll see you in about four"," Jack Smith, 31st October 1990. Thank you. get like a ringing in my left ear uh just on the one side and um there's actually been a few times when i felt kind of a bit sick or a bit dizzy as well just the left ear yeah it seems to be yeah Thank you. Nej, jag tror inte det. Nothing major, it's just the kind of disney's you get with nausea, not proper room spinning or anything like that, but just a little bit off balance and not fully comfortable, no. Thank you. Sure.

Okay, so usually with migraines they can present at different times in people's lives. So sometimes they can present as a child, sometimes they can present when they're older, and sometimes they can present even post-menopausally. So there's different ways you can get migraines. And the reason why this sounds like migraines is because it's on one side of the head, which is typical of a migraine. You've got blurry vision again, which is very typical with nausea and vomiting, that's also typical of a migraine. Now, obviously if the headache is really severe, and I'll suggest some medications you can try, if that doesn't work, we would want to see you as soon as possible to do a full neurological exam as well, to make sure that there's, you know, when we do a more specific examination. that everything all seems fine. I what I would recommend in the time between now and when we can see you if you take some medications, maybe something like ibuprofen. So yes, a migraine, yeah, you know, even sooner than that, we can look at maybe half an hour to 40 minutes, depending on what your response to it is. For some people, whatever medications they take, the migraine doesn't improve and it can last from anywhere from four hours to 72 hours. Migraines can last. But I'll be so no, so what there's lots of medication treatments, so they can be ibuprofen with an anti sickness, so and which you can get from the pharmacy and you also to drink a sugary carbonated drink, something like coke. So the three of them is a good sort of cocktail to start them, then we can go up the treatment ladder, you can get specific migraine relief medication and that's just something to try between now and when we see you to do the to do the assessment, where we can see you today at some point. But however, if you do take these medications and you know by the time your appointment comes in and you feel much better on yourself, you can cancel it. You can give us a call and cancel it. Any any questions for me? All right, okay. Any any further problems between now and your appointment, please do let us know. okay bye bye","Yeah, I'm Maria. Yeah, sorry. 27 of March of 90. So I'm having like a really really strong headache. I don't know what is happening, I'm quite concerned. So it started in the morning. I feel like dizzy, my vision is a little bit blurred, like it's it's really painful and I'm getting really concerned, especially because I'm having like these changes in the vision. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It came like kind of suddenly. Well, I had the kidney stone, so let's say that that's 10. I have now maybe five, what? Well, six, six, probably. But it's more about me being really concerned because this is very weird. Sorry? Um, well, not really. Like this, yeah, like this, no, definitely. It's something new. My vision is quite blurred. It's it's really weird, like some zigzag lines. Kind of. I don't know how to describe it properly. Yeah, I tried paracetamol, but uh, didn't work. To be honest, I feel exactly the same. Uh, well, uh, the headache started like four years, four hours ago, so I would say like maybe three hours ago, because I couldn't stand it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I feel a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, looking, I cannot stand screens, but yeah, definitely. And when I move, like the thing is that if I If I leave bed I start to feel like even worse if I move so I just want to have my head like really not moving. Oh yeah, oh I forgot to mention definitely I vomit twice. Actually as soon as the the headache started I also vomited so initially I thought it was something that I ate but then the headache started to be really bad and I still feel nausea. To be honest I'm about to vomit very soon I think. Sorry? Yes. So not actually my mother has migraines I'm not sure if that's relevant and also I have hypothyroidism in the family so it might be I don't know I don't know. I think we are losing connection.

No, not that I'm aware. no not that i'm aware yeah not that i'm aware i really doubt it well i'm a little bit hypochondriac so i feel that this can be some kind of brain tumor or something because i'm like this is really the pain is so worrisome that or maybe a stroke i don't know it's just like you know you hear so many stories that you definitely start to wonder if i should go to a n e urgently because i might really have something serious no not really it's really about the head that's why i find it very weird yeah yeah exactly sorry uh no no it's i don't know Not to describe it, but it's just like, yes. No, yeah. No, it's the first time, but I'm very familiar with the disease because my mother has it. Well, but I never had it.

Sounds Bye.",data/Primock-57/audio/day2_consultation02_doctor.wav,data/Primock-57/audio/day2_consultation02_patient.wav,541.56,541.5,"Hi there, good morning. I'm Dr Dean Misa from GP at hand. Nice to see you. Okay, before we start your appointment, could you please tell me your first name and your date of birth? Okay, that's great. Thank you for that. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak freely? Okay, great. Okay, so tell me a bit about what's been happening. You said you mentioned in the notes that you've got a problem with your elbow. Sure, sure. And sorry, did you say it was the left elbow or the right elbow? Left elbow. Okay. And have you banged that elbow? Did you have any kind of injury? Sure, okay. And in terms of your job, do you do anything physical? Right. Okay. And has this happened before? Sure, okay. And can I, can I just double check, has anyone in your family got any kind of rheumatology diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus or anything like that? Okay. So you said you think you've got osteoarthritis. Has anyone ever told you that? Have you ever seen a doctor who's confirmed that and told you you've got osteoarthritis? Okay. Was that a GP or a specialist or a physiotherapist? GP. Okay. All right. Um, can I just, sorry, can I just double check how old you are please? 53. Okay. Fantastic. All right. And do you have any other illnesses at all? Right. Okay. Are you allergic to any medication? No, sure. And do you, are you on any medication on a regular basis? this no okay and you normally fit in well mobile active okay good glad to hear that well done that's good it's good that you're doing that on a regular basis okay um and um ah is it possible for me to have a look at your elbow now okay bear with me one second right okay and if you can just raise your elbow up a little bit like that a bit higher so i can just see the underside okay fantastic all right and if you can just touch the tip of your elbow with your fingers is it is it hot compared to the surrounding skin the adjacent skin it's a bit warmer okay um and um is it very tender when you're pressing on that now does it if you give it a press does it hurt you at all okay what i noticed the skin was a bit dry on the tip of the elbow but do you do you have dry skin anywhere else in the body do you suffer from eczema at all no alright okay so um what i think we should do with regards to your elbow problem. Okay, is um, I think it would be worthwhile. This seems like what we call the bursitis. Okay, so that's an inflammation of one of the fluid sacks around the joint. Um, what I think we should do is I think you should be on some anti-inflammatory medication in the first instance. And as well as that, what I would like to do is to get some blood tests done to check for other types of causes of joint swelling. Okay, so um, what we're going to do is we're going to arrange some blood test forms to be sent out to your house. And there'll be instructions within that pack about where to get the blood test done. And that will involve you having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers, infection, rheumatological antibodies. So we'll do a full screen and also check for things like gout as well. Okay, um, the time frame for that will be the results will come back to us after about five, six days from now. So we take time for the forms to come out to you. And if you get the test done straight away, by the time that we're expecting a result back, you know, one or two days after that, we're looking at maybe six days. And what I'd suggest is we can arrange a follow-up appointment for you, the clinic, where we can have a look at your joint, feel it, we can review the blood tests and we can get a gauge as to what's going on. Now in terms of your joint right now, it doesn't look like to me like something called, excuse me, septic arthritis. So we are worried sometimes that something's going on. Someone might have an acutely infected joint and your your joint doesn't look like that however if your the elbow was to become very red very painful and the redness was to spread or become you know more intense then you need to get on the phone or get have a video appointment with one of us as soon as possible because that would be an emergency that would require more immediate assessment more immediate treatment okay no i don't think this is anything dangerous don't worry okay what i'm doing is i'm just outlining the worst case scenario if things were to develop okay so if things were to worsen this this is not the case right now right now it looks quite straightforward it's nothing sinister or life threatening what i'm doing is i'm just saying in case things worsen these are the things that we'd be looking out for and this is what you have to do but you don't have that now thankfully and i don't think you're going to have it but i'm just saying the what if scenario is that okay all right did you have any questions that you wanted to ask me okay so i would take ibuprofen regularly okay you can get that over the counter that's 400 milligrams two times a day and you should take take that after food not on an empty stomach if you get any heartburn stop taking it okay all right so what i want to do is i'll get the form sent out to you and We are going to arrange a follow up appointment maybe within a actually you know the follow up appointment doesn't have to be face to face if it's more convenient to do it over the phone we can do that over the phone over video you can do that as well that's your call but you contact us after you've had the blood test done and we can review things then okay sure sure that's a good idea all right then okay um take care then so just leave that with me i'll sort out those bits and pieces out and then we'll get them sent out to you and then we'll we'll review you after the test things go well okay all right then take care then all the best bye bye","Hello, good morning.

So use that. You, you have to use it twice a day, for the next couple of weeks. OK. If, if there's no improvement, you need to get back to us. Or, if you have any kind of adverse reaction, like an allergic reaction, which is unlikely, but if it still happens you need to get in touch with us. OK? <UNIN/> So, what we're going to do is, we're going to send off the prescription to your pharmacy. It looks like Boots on the systems, is that correct? Yeah? Yes, so i'll send it across to Boot's. And it will be there for <UNIN/> collecting. If things are getting worse in the next two weeks, call us before hand. Otherwise, wait for two weeks, take the medication and the cream. You still need to continue on your, emollients like the dermal soap, and, as well as the, <UNSURE>diprovate</UNSURE>. Yeah, so you still need to use those, in the interim.

My name is Sarah Smith and my date of birth is the 20th of the 4th, 1980. Great. Yeah. Yeah, I was watching TV and just like over the last hour I've started to feel like a bit short of breath. Yeah. No. So I started with a cough yesterday. Yeah, I don't know if it's relevant, but I had a C-section a few weeks ago. Yeah, four weeks. Yes, I am. Yep, he's good. No, no, he's fine. No, I haven't, no. You know, I get coughs and colds quite a lot, but probably good few months ago. Yeah. No. I mean, yeah, my chest feels sore, but so does my C-section scar, you know, it's all tender. No, just some pinkness. They gave me some codeine. Yeah, I've been taking that fairly regularly, but probably haven't taken it for a week. Yeah. Um, no. I'm allergic to ibuprofen though. Um, I don't know. Uh, yeah. No, I haven't, no. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. It feels a bit dramatic to call an ambulance. I will go. I will take myself. Okay. Okay. No, my partner's at work. Okay. All right. Okay, that makes sense. Okay, yeah, I mean, my mum's had clots in her legs before, so I guess, you know, yeah, that makes sense. I know what they are. No, no, I'm fine. I'll just take myself to the hospital. All right, thank you. Bye."," Hi. Hi, can you hear me? Good. My name is Dr. Gohil. I'm one of the physicians that works here at Babylon. Can I confirm your name and date of birth, please? 1983. And Are you in anything else? Okay. Okay. And how long ago was that? Just a few weeks? Okay. And are you with baby at the moment? And how is baby doing? Okay. And he coughed so cold. shortness of breath you're having is it getting worse okay so you're feeling your heart more than normal and the shortness of breath does it cause any pain in your chest how about when you take ibuprofen? So I need you to do something for me. Have you measured the rate of your heart before? Have you measured it moment which is probably because of your shortness of breath and some of the pain that you're under given that you've had a c-section and you're short of breath which has come on either be found in the legs or your chest so in your lungs it's quite a common thing to happen and it's not something to worry about but needs to be checked up in the hospital first and if it if that does become the case they can give you something to reduce the clock. It's a really quick process."," Hey. Yeah, I can hear you. Okay. My name is Sarah Smith and C-section a few weeks ago, yeah, four weeks, yes, I am, yep, he's good. no I mean I don't know I feel, yes, no. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. yeah okay all right okay that makes okay yeah I mean my mum's had clots in her legs before so"

Just before I go any further, can you confirm your name and your age please? Okay. And how can I help you, Mrs Smith? Right. Well, thank you for coming in. So hopefully we can help with your symptoms. And so you mentioned it's started a few days ago. So can you tell me a bit more about that? What kind of pain it is that you're experiencing? Okay. And the pain in your tummy, is it, can you describe the pain to me? Is it cramping, burning, sharp? Right. Okay. Okay. Fine. And have you found yourself going to the toilet more often than normal? No. Okay. Fine. Could we note any? Any funny colour to your urine? So has it been any blood in your urine or have you seen any other darkening of your urine? Yeah, okay, fine, okay, right, let me just write a few notes down as well. Fine, and you mentioned a tummy pain that also started a few days ago. Does the pain move anywhere else? Does it move towards the back or towards your flank? No, okay, fine. With these symptoms, have you noticed any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting? Okay, any fevers or temperatures? Sorry, any fevers or temperatures? No, okay, fine, sorry. Okay, in terms of your bowels, are your bowels working okay? Any diarrhoea, loose stool? Okay, alright. And then Jessica, sometimes we have to ask very private, sensitive questions just to get a full history. I hope you don't mind me asking, but are you currently sexually active? Okay, ended up with a regular partner. Fine, okay. Have you noticed any other discharge from from down below? No, okay. When was your last last STD screen, if if ever? Okay, fine. And do you use any form of contraception at all? You use condoms at all? Okay. And when was your last period? Is there any chance you could be pregnant, perhaps? Is there any chance you could be pregnant? No. It's always worth asking young females like yourself, uh uh so if that obviously if you are worried about a pain, um not getting any better, then I always advise you doing a pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy. Okay. Fine. So just moving on, moving on. Are you otherwise fitting well? And so by that I mean do you have any other medical problems, medical hit, med-medical history? Okay. Do you take any regular medications? Okay, so you've tried that and it didn't help. Okay, all right. Do you have any allergies to any medications? And what happens when you take indomycine?

That must be very difficult for you. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> <UNIN/> quite lethargic and weak, you mentioned. <UNSURE>Um</UNSURE>, OK. And um, April are you normally otherwise fit and well? Uh fit and well. So do you have any other medical history? OK. OK. And what do you take for your blood pressure? Any, or what what medications do you take on a regular basis, if you don't mind saying? Yep. Zinopril. OK, fine. Any allergies at all, to medications? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> No, OK. Regarding any family history, is there anything I should be aware of? OK, alright. Who's looking after your diabetes? Is there anyone, is there a doctor in a hospital, who looks after your diabetes? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Right, excellent. And in terms of your social situation, who lives at home with you? lives OK, um fine. Is your partner well at the moment? Right, OK. <UNSURE>So he</UNSURE> Go away, he's got away with it, at the moment. OK. And uh, are you working at the moment, April? Yeah. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> No, I can imagine. What is it that you do for work? Ohh, so you work in the IT field. OK. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> IT field. Right, OK. Uh No. Has it been quite stressful recently? OK. The reason I ask is sometimes Sure. <UNIN/> reason I ask is because sometimes stress can really affect your immune system. Um but uh it's good to know you're you're you're not feeling stressed. Um, do you smoke at all, April? OK. Um and what about alcohol? And what is it that you drink? <UNSURE>The wine</UNSURE>. How much do you drink on those nights? OK. So um, yeah so you're probably just about under the limit of um, the recommended limit. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Something <UNIN/> think about, just in terms of your blood pressure and diabetes, maybe something that you can maybe cut down on if you can. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> really ideally, the the the right answer is to cut down completely. But so in practice I know that's not realistic. So maybe for the first few weeks, why don't you cut down to two glasses a week. And then, one week thereafter Um and if you are coping OK, then you can maybe try and cut down altogether. OK? Just something for you to think about. Um, right so uh just <UNIN/> as we wrap up really, um April I think based on your story, I think uh essentially I think you're, you're going through a bit of a bit of a viral illness. Um, I don't think there's anything to worry about. You know you've had a bit of a cough, bit of a runny nose, feeling quite weak and lethargic. I'm hoping that, you know, you're probably over the worst of it now. It's been five days. I'm hoping you're maybe going to get better in the next couple of days. It normally lasts for about a week to ten days. Yeah, absolutely. So, you know things you can do to help yourself in the meantime is to, you know get some nice, good rest. Drink plenty of fluids. Keep yourself well-hydrated. You can take regular Paracetamol. If you feel like you're still not getting any better in two to three days, it's probably worth coming back to see me again. We can check you over. And if you are still feeling feverish, um and your cough isn't getting any better, then we may look to give you some antibiotics for your chest. <UNIN/> some of the uh uh common source of infection. Um Yeah so I think you know <UNIN/>, really I think it depends on you. <UNIN/> it's um if you are coughing, then there is a theoretical, you know risk that you're maybe slightly infectious still. So I would say maybe take a day or two off work, if you can. Uh and get some good bed rest. Um and maybe think about work early next week. But um, if your cough isn't getting any better, or your breathing is getting worse, I want you to come back and see me sooner. OK? No no no <UNIN/>, nothing to worry about otherwise. OK. Well, have a good day. Appreciate it.","Hello? Uh, yeah. Uh my name is April, and I'm fifty. Well I've just been having this like, cough, for quite a few days. And my nose is running. Um and it's just been super annoying, and it's not going away. Uh I think it started like maybe, a bit less than a week ago. Like maybe, maybe five or six days ago. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Uh, it's just so continuous. It's really, really frustrating. It's quite dry. And it's just all day, it like keeps me up at night as well, which is really annoying. I mean, apart from, I mean the coughing is giving me a sore throat. But it's not like, you know not more than, than that. You know just, just my throat is irritated from coughing. But it's not like, it's not that bad when I swallow or anything. No.They feel OK, actually. Yeah. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. Nothing, nothing on the ears. Um, I don't think so. Like, I guess I get laboured when I'm coughing and I can't breathe. But I, not, yeah, not, I, I don't think so. Not really. I don't feel restless. No, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> I feel you know, generally tired. So like, yeah, but <UNIN/> not, not anything special with my chest. No not, not that either. Um I've been having like, like shivers, even when I'm in, when I'm in bed. You know like, when you, when you go to sleep and, and you feel like I I should be warm. But I'm still, still you know, shivering a little bit. But I haven't taken my temperature, so I'm not a hundred percent sure if I had a fever. But it feels like I probably did. 'Cause I was just, I was next to my boyfriend. And he was completely warm and totally fine. And I just like couldn't stop shivering. And kept adding more sweaters on, and I was still cold. No. No, no nausea. No vomiting. Like, um yeah, <UNIN/> nothing like that. Um, I mean it's OK. I, at the beginning, like when I was starting to have the <UNIN/>, the <UNIN/>, the coughing and stuff. Um, I had a little bit of diarrhea. Um but, but it didn't, it didn't cut my appetite or anything. I just like, my stomach wasn't feeling great. Yeah, yeah. It got better. It was only like the first, like it started at the same time as the cough started. And then it stopped. So I thought everything would be fine. But then the cough just kept going. With my what? Ohh. Uh, no. No no, it's fine. No. I, I drank loads of water, when I started having the diarrhea. Now that it stopped, I just went back to normal. Uh <UNIN/> like my, you know when I had the, when I was telling you I had like the, I had chills, and I was really cold. My <UNSURE>muscle </UNSURE> was really hurting. Sometimes I do pilates. But like, it's hurting me so much at the moment. Um so, to be honest, all I feel like doing is just lying in bed. Yeah, <UNSURE>right</UNSURE>. Especially like in my arms, my legs, like just everywhere basically. Yeah, pretty much. Am I normally what? Uh, well I have type two diabetes. And I have quite high blood pressure. Um I take <UNIN/> Metformin for the diabetes. And I take Lisinopril for the high blood pressure. No. No allergies. Uh my dad also has type two diabetes. But I think that's it. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> I just regularly go see a doctor. Um, that just checks up on it. Same with the high blood pressure. Like I, I have it under control. And since I've started taking this medication, I've just been like regularly checking that it, it's under control. Uh just, it's just me and my partner. Yeah he has none of this. Like he's just going ahead like, like <UNIN/> nothing. Like I was a bit worried that I would pass it to him but, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> not uh, diarrhea, nothing, fine. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Uh, yeah I am working. But the, the first day I skipped. <UNIN/> because I was feeling just too shit. Um, but then, I just felt like had to go back, 'cause I had so much to do. <UNIN/> So I've been going in. But it's not been fun. Uh, I am a developer. <UNIN/> yeah. Work in IT. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> not too active a job. Uh, yeah. Not more than usual. I don't think it's related to stress. Like I, I don't feel like I've had a particularly hard time at work that way. Um <UNIN/> I've been able to take a day off to try and recover. So yeah, I don't think it's related. I used to, but I've stopped for about six months now. I mean, yeah I, I don't think I drank that much. Like, I I don't really know how you count the units. So I guess like I don't drink more than like, like, let's say three evenings a week? And I rarely get like properly drunk, or anything. Wine, mostly. Uh, I'd say like maybe two or three glasses. Yeah? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> I should cut down on it. OK. Yeah. What, what should I do if it just keeps going on and on? Like if it's still going on in, in say four days? Do you think I should keep going to work? Or do you think I should just OK. OK. Thank you. OK. But otherwise, I don't need to worry. OK. Alright. Thank you very much. Thank you.

And also some, sachets um, which you can get from the chemist, some sachets which just help change the acidity of your urine. So I, I can put the details of that on your notes. Um, if you feel like your pain is getting worse or not settling, you get lower back pain, um, or you're getting a high temperature, or you have any problems actually passing urine.
