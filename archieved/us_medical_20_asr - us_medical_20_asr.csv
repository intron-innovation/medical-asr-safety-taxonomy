D: I see OK. And can you tell me a little about your living situation right now, like you're living with and where?

P: Yeah so I'm living with my wife and um daughter and I'm living just in a condominium in the city.

D: OK, and are you working right now?

P: Yeah, so I'm an accountant. I'm working from home, so it's not that bad, but I I might just take a few days off depending on what I have to do with this injury.

D: OK, and um do you and hobby wise you mentioned like weight lifting, are you an active person like bodybuilding and that sort of thing regularly? 

P: I I just actually probably started this past year. I used to. I used to workout a lot. In University and in my early 30s but then I stopped and this year I've kind of gone back into it.

D: OK, well it's good that you're staying active. And um do you smoke cigarettes?

P: No, I uh, probably tried a couple times and. High School and University, but just it was never my thing.

D: OK, and how about cannabis, like smoking marijuana or using any of those types of products?

P: No, I I try to stay away from any drugs.

D: OK, uh, including recreational drugs?

P: Yeah.

D: OK and. Uh, are there any musculoskeletal or neurological problems that that run in the family?

P: Not that I know of, no.

D: OK, now how about any autoimmune diseases?

P: Uh, no, I don't think so.

D: OK, so next I just wanted to ask you to have a look at the at the arm. Compared to the other side, are you noticing any swelling, redness, or?

P: Yeah, any swelling or redness, I do see some just like kind of like in the middle of this area, some redness kind of looks like some bruising in in that in that region. Uhm, I also feel like when I like try to flex my biceps kind of have moved upwards.

D: OK, is this the mass or lump that I you were mentioning earlier that you kinda can notice in the in your right arm? 

P: Yeah yeah.

D: OK, is there any temperature change, like does it feel warm on that side?

P: Uhm I can't really tell if it's warm or not.

D: OK, and you so you mentioned are you able to bend your elbow all the way up so to flex it all the way up, or is a range of motion limited?

P: It's pretty limited. It's pretty tough to flex. It's really painful and that I also can't like. I can't turn my arm, I can't supinate.

D: OK so yeah, so is that so you have reduced supination as well?

P: Yeah.

D: And how are your shoulder movement, are you able to like if you're lifting your arms straight out in front of you, are you able to to lift them all the way up above your head?

P: Out like at the sides or in front of me?

D: In front of you. 

P: Yeah, the shoulder seems to be OK. I am able to lift up, but it's just if I try to move my upper arms at all it hurts a lot.

D: OK, alright so. You'll get some pain at the at the shoulder with the movement.

P: There there is discomfort in the affected side, but I can I can move it much more than I can move my elbows or anything like that. 

D: OK, I see. So I think that was everything that I wanted to ask about and and I look for on on the physical today. Was there anything I may be missed or anything like that? 

P: Uhm no I think, uh, I don't have any other questions.

D: OK, alright, so based on the history and what you're telling me for the physical as well of having a history of exercising and also shoulder pain with overhead head movements which are risk factors for developing a biceps, tendon tear or biceps tendon injury. And having the swelling and bruising as well as reduced function of biceps or elbow flexion, they all suggests that there is a biceps, tendon tear, or injury there, and so will want to get an ultrasound or MRI to look at will start with the ultrasound, but then possibly get an MRI as well to look at the extent of the tissue damage, but if there is just a long head of biceps tear, it will usually be treated conservatively. And so we'll just need to look to see what the extent of the injury is.

P: Yep they are. 

D: Excellent, um OK and do you smoke cigarettes? 

P: No, I don't.

D: How about marijuana or using other cannabis products?

P: No. 

D: OK and do you use any recreational drugs?

P: Uh no.

D: OK, and how about alcohol, how many drinks per week would you have usually?

P: Um alcohol have about. I usually have about 2 glasses of wine a day.

D: OK, and has that changed recently for you.

P: No, not really. I've just been I've also been start drinking like a beer every day as well recently.

D: OK. Alright, and alright could you tell me a little bit about your living situation right now who you're living with and and where?

P: I live with my son in a house.

D: OK, uh, and have you been around anybody who's been sick? 

P: No. 

D: Alright, and have you traveled anywhere recently?

P: Um no no travel recently. 

D: OK, and and can you tell me a little bit about your diet an and like do you eat a lot of red meat and or a lot of seafood like like shell shellfish?

P: I eat a lot of red meats. But not a lot of um seafood.

D: OK. And. OK, and anybody in the family have a history of musculoskeletal or or neurological conditions?

P: Um so. Who OK, so my my father had like arthritis and I don't remember what kind of arthritis he had but he had severe arthritis. He also had high blood pressure and diabetes, and on my mother's side. Um there is some arthritis there as well and as well as gout and kidney stones.

D: OK.  So that that was everything I wanted to ask all the history. And so, uh, next to ask you to have a look at your feet. And are you seeing any swelling, redness, or discolouration?

P: I see some redness and uh, some swelling in that area.

D: OK, and are you feeling any temperature changes?

P: Yes, and the right one is definitely warmer than the left.

D: OK, then how about any muscle atrophy in the foot or or lower leg or any joint malalignment or deformities?

P: Uh, so in terms of deformity is like it just looks swollen and so there's like a big bump on the right side of my foot, whereas it's completely straight on my left, but other than that, no deformities.

D: OK, and if you were to a palpate or press on areas of your foot or joints of your toes, are you feeling any any pains along the top of your foot or or in any of your other toes?

P: None of my other toes.

D: OK, and how about any pains at the ankle?

P: Um no pain at the ankle.

D: OK, so the metatarsals are not having any pain and then the joints of the 2nd 5th digits are pain free along with the ankle as well. Um and when it comes to range of motion, are you able to flex your toes downwards and extend them upwards towards your nose?

P: Yes, I can do that.

D: OK, and how about your ankle, are you able to um move your ankle on a full range of motion.

P: I can.

D: OK, and are you having a limping with, walking or otherwise called an antalgic gait?

P: Somewhat because I'm trying not to put too much weight on my right big toe.

D: OK. Alright, and so I think that was everything that I wanted to ask and check today. So did you have any other questions or anything that I maybe forgot to ask about you wanted to mention today?

P: Um no just what can I do for my foot how do I make the swelling go down?

D: Yeah, for sure it's so right now with having a like a red, warm and swollen joint that that's extremely tender and has limited range of motion. It's important to rule out a septic arthritis, however. Based on several of the risk factors such as diabetes, and obesity, as well as your family history of arthritis and gout. Taking the most likely thing is that this is a gout flare, and in particular in the toe like that it could be called podagra and so we will need to get a aspiration of the joint fluid just to send it off and make sure that it's not not an infection and that we're treating the right thing. If this is, gout and it comes back that this way it's treated with that high dose, high doses of anti inflammatories. I will start with medication called colchicine to help with this flare, and in the meantime, important things for preventing this in the future are diet and kind of lifestyle related with reducing things like red meats, alcohol, weight loss and um just trying to improve the diabetes management as well.

P: OK, that sounds great. Thank you.

So the first thing that we will um, need to do, we'll need to do some blood work just to get some inflammation markers and just your uh, CBC, and see if you have um, an infection. However, we'll also need to do a joint aspiration of your of your um, go your knee, and we'll be taking some fluid within your joint called the synovial fluid and assess for um, we'll send in for um, culture, and look for like these crystals, and count. And then based on that, we'll understand um, the infection you have and what kind of infection you have. We will start you on antibiotics right away um, today, and so you will be um, here for a while until we get all those results back. And you may also require um, an admission today as well.

Have you had when was the last time you had cellulitis? The last time was about six months ago. Okay, and were you admitted at all or were you treated as an outpatient? I was treated as an outpatient for that. And it did clear up. It wasn't the first time that I've had cellulitis and yeah, so it was treated. Okay. Have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past? No, I haven't. Okay. Any family history of any conditions, musculoskeletal or rheumatologic conditions? Any rheumatoid arthritis? Anything like that? I don't think so. Okay. And currently, right now, what is your living situation like? So I just live with two of my actually, no, I live with my parents. And yeah, it's just both my parents. Okay. And do you currently work? I was working until like 15 years ago now. I got injured on the at work and I've had like chronic back pain and I don't know. I think that's kind of how this partly all started. So I've been at home. I'm receiving I'm on disability. Okay. And do you smoke cigarettes? I do, yeah. I smoke about half a pack, two pack a day. Okay, and how long have you been smoking for? So this has been about 20 years. 20 years, okay. And do you drink alcohol? Sometimes, yeah. I'll have just a few beers, maybe a few beers a week. Okay. And yeah, we were just talking about some of like the movements, but you're saying you have pain with any kind of movement at all, right? Yeah, it's really painful. I try not to move it at all. And it's very red and swollen and warm as well? Yeah, all of those. Any symptoms at all in your hips or ankle? No, those feel fine. I can move my hip and ankle okay, and no pain. Okay. All right, so those are all the questions I had for you. We'll do like a full physical examination, take a look at your knee. And most likely what this sounds like is something called septic arthritis. It's when there's like an infection that can go into your joints and it is a pretty serious issue that we need to assess and treat as soon as possible. So the first thing that we will need to do, we'll need to do some blood work just to get some inflammation markers and just your CBC and see if you have an infection. However, we'll also need to do a joint aspiration of your knee and we'll be taking some fluid within your joint called the synovial fluid and assess for we'll send in for culture and look for like these crystals and count and then based on that we'll understand the infection you have and what kind of infection you have. We will start you on antibiotics right away today and so you will be here for a while until we get all those results back and you may also require an admission today as well. Okay thank you. Yeah that sounds good. All right. Yeah. So yeah, we'll get all that done for you shortly and we'll go from there. All right. Thank you. And we might also need an x-ray so just sit tight. We'll come call you. Okay. Thank you. All right. You're welcome.",what brings you in here today i i i had this uh i had this pain in my knee it started within the last day or two and it's been going on for about two days ago and it's just been going on and on and on and i've been on disability for about two years and i was working until like i um yeah about fifteen years ago and i like i i got injured on the uh at work and i've had like chronic back pain and i don't know this i think that's kind of how this partly all started so i've been at home i receiving uh i'm on disability uh and most likely what this sounds like is something called septic arthritis it's uh it's when uh there's like an infection that um can uh go into your joints and uh it is a pretty serious issue that we need to um assess and treat as soon as possible so the first
MSK0045,/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/BioRAMP/ASR/data/us_medical_20/audio/MSK0045.mp3,"D: What brings you here today?

P: Um so I'm here because my shoulder has been really painful for the past week um and any movement of that shoulder, of my right shoulder, causes a lot of pain.

D: OK, and how long have you been having uh this pain for?

P: For the past week,

D: Past week, OK. Um and did you injure your shoulder at all recently? Any trauma to the area or anything like that?

P: Um so about like, a couple of months ago, I um was do, I I work in construction so um I was moving around some heavy objects and um I guess like the repetitive motions caused some sort of rotator cuff injury. But I had that um, like I got that treated and everything was fine for a couple of months. But this pain just started a week ago.

D: OK, and where is this pain located exactly?

P: Um it's it's just like in my shoulder, like at the joint between my upper arm and um shoulder.

D: OK, and uh is it an aching pain or is it a sharp stabbing pain?

P: So at rest it seems to be like achy and stiff, but um but when I move my shoulder, when I try to move it, it it causes more of a sharp pain.

D: Sharp pain, OK and what kind of movements cause the sharp pain? Or is it just any movement?

P: Uh any movement.

D:  OK. Are there any uh movements that are worse in particular?

P: Um I think um, like no, anything hurts.

D: OK. OK, and how much would you rate this pain out, on a scale of zero to 10, 10 being the worst pain you felt in your life?

P: I'd give it about a 7. 

D: Seven, OK.

P: Yeah.

D: And are you having uh, is this pain moving to any other uh joints or any other part of your body?

P: No. 

D: OK, so just just in the area that you described?

P: Yes. 

D: OK, and do you notice any kind of um, just looking at your shoulder outside, from the outside, any swelling, redness, any masses or deformities?

P: No, I don't see anything like that.

D: OK, alright and um is there anything that you've tried that has helped with your pain?

P: Um I've tried some ibuprofen, some ice. It seems to help temporarily.

D: OK, and earlier when you had the rotator cuff injury, did you get physiotherapy? 

P: Um I did. But not, but I didn't finish the full course. I just went for a week or so and then um I had to go back to work, um so I stopped doing that.

D: I see, um yeah, so that's something definitely uh it's very important and we'll need to consider going forward as well. Other than that, are you having any symptoms of any fevers or chills?

P: Uh no, nothing like that.

D: OK, and have you been sick recently at all or met with someone who was sick?

P: No.

D: OK, any any weight loss um or loss of appetite? Anything like that?

P: Uh no, nothing like that.

D: OK, any numbness or tingling? 

P: No.

D: Any weakness in your extremities?

P: No.

D: Any um any just symptoms or anything else like diarrhea, constipation, urinary changes? Anything else is going on?
 
P: No. 

D: No, OK. So it's mainly just the shoulder pain?

P: Yes. 

D: OK, um alright, and does rest help at all, like when you're lying down, just not moving your shoulder. Does that help with your pain?

P: Uh, yeah I would say so.

D: OK. And is is this stiffness there just throughout the day, or is it there in the morning and then gets better during the day?

P: It's pretty much there all day.

D: OK. Alright um and have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?

P: Uh, I have um, I have diabetes, but that's about it.

D: OK, and do you take any medications?

P: I'm on metformin. 

D: OK. Um and do you have any allergies to any medications?

P: No, no allergies to medications.

D: Have you been hospitalized or had any surgeries in the past? 

P: No. 

D: No, OK. Um any family history of any musculoskeletal or rheumatological conditions?

P: No. 

D: OK, and currently right now, so you said you work as a construction worker, right?

P: Yes.

D: And are you off of work right now, or have you been off work um due to your previous injury and pain, or are you still working?

P: I'm still working, but modified, um so I am not uh lifting any heavy objects or anything like that. I'm just doing some like groundwork.

D: OK, that's good. Yeah, I mean, um we might also need to, if you're doing any kind of overhead like work where you're raising your arms above your shoulders, that might uh, cause further problems as well, so we'll look into some of those modified duties as well.

P: OK.

D: Um yeah, and what is your living situation like right now? Who do you live with?

P: Um I live by myself right now.

D: Do you live in a house or apartment?

P: Um I live in an apartment. 

D: And, uh, uh, in terms of your daily life, do you smoke at all?

P: Um I don't smoke. I used to smoke before, but that was like 20 years ago.

D: OK, that's good, and do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana or any other drugs?

P: Uh no, no.

D: How about smoking, you smoke cigarettes? Sorry, you said you you quit. Um do you drink alcohol?

P: I'll drink like a glass of wine here and there.

D: OK. Alright, um yeah, and those were some of the questions I had for you. In terms of just a physical examination, uh when you press on the area that you describe, um when you press around the area, does it hurt?

P: I have to press pretty hard for it to hurt.

D: OK, but otherwise it's not tender?

P: No.

D: OK, and again, no swelling, redness, or anything like that, just it's mainly just on the inside?

P: Yeah.

D: OK, and um and any kind of movement hurts, right? There's no particular movement that, like if you were instead of um trying to raise that shoulder by itself, if you were to just move it with the other arm. Does it hurt?

P: The other arm? The other arm doesn't hurt at all.

D: Or like if you were to use your left arm to to passively move your right arm and shoulder. Does that hurt or is it when you just try to move the right arm by itself?

P: It's, oh, it still hurts, any any moving of the shoulder hurts.

D:  OK, alright, so yeah, so based on what um you've told me so far in your recent shoulder cuff injury, what can sometimes happen is uh with those injuries, you might get some um inflammation and what might happen is something called uh adhesive capsulitis, or just commonly knows as known as a frozen shoulder. And there's different stages, so that might happen, so in the initial stages like freezing um and then there's stiffening in stage two, and then usually after 6 to 12 months it starts uh getting better.

P: OK.

D: Um and it might also affect your other shoulder as well. So what we'll um end up doing today is see if um we can get some um imaging done so we can do an X-Ray of your shoulder. I'm sure you've had X Rays before, so we'll kind of compare them to your shoulder X Rays from before. We, if we need to, we can also get an ultrasound if um we don't, uh we can't really tell from the X Rays. And then from there, um we can get some blood work as well. Um just your normal blood work as well as inflammation markers, and then um from there we'll need to uh, really um discuss some management strategies. So you've already tried some physiotherapy, but now we need to make sure that's uh, it's it's consistent because this is something that has a high recurrence rate and we will definitely need to finish the full course of physiotherapy, whatever it may be, um because if physiotherapy doesn't work, we may have to consider like other options like um corticosteroid injections right into your shoulder.

P: OK. 

D: For some relief.  But yeah, so first we'll just try some conservative methods like physiotherapy, pain management, uh and then go from there. How does that sound?

P: That sounds pretty good. Thank you.

D: Welcome, alright, so we'll call you for the X-Rays and then we'll go from there.

MSK0046,/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/BioRAMP/ASR/data/us_medical_20/audio/MSK0046.mp3,"D: What brings you here today?

P: Um I'm here because my left hand, kind of just like at the base of my thumb, has been hurting for the past two days and it seems to be getting worse, um and I'm left handed so it's really hard for me to write or do anything um where I have to like, clench or grip things.

D: OK, and how long has this been going on for?

P: Uhm, so for the past two days, but it's got, it got bad yesterday.

D: OK, and have you had any, uh if you were to describe the pain, where is it located exactly?

P: It's just at the base of my thumb. Uh you know where the fleshy part of your hand is?

D: OK yeah yeah.

P: Yeah, so just just over there.

D: OK, and what kind of pain is it? Is it sharp or is it aching?

P: Uhm, it's it's like a um, at baseline it's an achy pain, but if I try to move it or um try to write or you know, use a computer or anything like that, it becomes sharp. 

D: OK, Um and on a scale of uh zero to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've felt in your life, how much would you rate it?

P: I'd say like a 6.

D: OK, and does this pain move anywhere else in your hand, or does it just stay where you described?

P: Um it just stays there. 

D: OK, and what kind of motions uh cause the most pain?

P: I'd say like um you know, trying to touch my pinky with my thumb, that that hurts. Um just like trying to rotate it hurts.

D: OK, um have you tried anything for the pain that has helped? 

P: Uhm, no, I haven't really tried too much. I've just I just tried not to use it as much.

D: I see. OK. And um, has this ever like, have you ever had any injuries to this hand? Any trauma either recently or in the past?

P: No, no, nothing like that.

D: OK. Alright, and is there any, do you do any kind of repetitive work that requires gripping or lifting um with that hand, anything repetitive?

P: So I do a lot of work at the computer. And um I guess I tend to type a lot with my left hand, so maybe that.

D: OK.

P: And sorry I also take lots of notes, like handwritten notes with my left hand.

D: OK, so are you left handed? 

P: Yes.

D: OK. Alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?

P: No. 

D: No, so you're healthy?

P: Yes.

D: Um do you take any medications on a regular basis? 

P: Uh no, no.

D: No, OK. Any allergies to any medications?

P: Um no allergies.

D: OK, um any previous surgeries or hospitalizations?

P: No.

D: No, any family history of any medical conditions, whether it's musculoskeletal, rheumatological, any conditions?

P: Uh no, nothing like that.

D: OK, um any cancers in the family?

P: Um I know there's, yeah there's a lot of cancer in the family. There's colon cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer. 

D: OK. And are they first degree relatives who had those cancers?

P: Uh no first degree relatives, just like aunts and uncles. 

D: OK. Uh alright, and currently are you working right now or have you had any time off work or any modified duties?

P: Um so I'm still working online, I've just um haven't been taking notes by hand anymore.

D: I see, and does that help though? 

P: Uh yeah it it has helped a little bit because I'm not moving my hand as much so it helps with the pain. 

D: OK. Have you taken any uh Tylenol, Advil, anything for the pain? 

P: No, I haven't.

D: OK. Alright. And currently right now, what is your living situation like?

P: Uh I live in an apartment by myself.

D: OK, and um, do you currently uh smoke cigarettes? 

P: Um I smoke, I used to smoke like five years ago, and I only did that for like a year or two, um and it wasn't very much. But I don't smoke anymore.

D: OK, that's good. Um any alcohol?

P: Um I'll have like a beer on the weekend.

D: OK. Any recreational drugs like marijuana?

P: Um I will take an edible like once a month.

D: OK. Um and yeah, those were just some of the questions I had um and we're just going to do a few things for examining, examining uh that area. So are you able to make a fist?

P: Um I can, but it hurts.

D: OK, it hurts in that location that you mentioned?

P: Yes. 

D: How about um if you make a fist without your thumb, does it still hurt or is it just when you are moving the thumb?

P: It's just when I'm moving the thumb.

D: OK. And if you were able to, are you able to uh rotate your wrist?

P: Uh yes, I can rotate my wrist.

D: Does that hurt at all? 

P: No.

D: OK, um now I just want you to do this one test. It's called a Finkelstein test. OK so I want you to flex your thumb, press it up down against your palm.

P: OK. 

D: And then hold your hand, sorry.

P: No, go ahead.

D: Yeah, and then after you do that, um, bring your fingers above your thumb, so just cover your thumb.

P: OK.

D: Kind of like a fist, but your thumb is on the inside of your fingers.

P: OK.

D: And then bring your uh arm out.

P: OK. 

D: And with your other hand, can you, from above push your wrist downwards? So your uh pinky finger is uh pointing to the pointing to the ground.

P: OK, yep.

D: Yeah, and did that hurt at all? Like when you, so this is just called ulnar deviation or your um of your wrist. Does that hurt at all?

P: Yes, that is very painful.

D: That's very painful, OK. Alright, um and then you're also having pain with gripping and, OK, so those are kind of all the things I wanted to ask. Uh it seems that you may be having something called De Quervain's tenosynovitis. Um it's caused by some repetitive motions, uh it can be due to gripping. Sometimes it happens to new mothers who are lifting their children as well as daycare workers. It can also happen in other work environments, and so what we will first just need to do um is mainly to rule out something like osteoarthritis. You are fairly young um but if there was ever an injury in the past, it you can have early osteoarthritis in the area. So we just want to get an X-Ray. And other than that, the way we kind of deal with this issue is usually conservatively and with a splint. 

P: OK. 

D: And a sling for your thumb that uh helps relieve some of these symptoms, uh restricts some of your movements, reduces some of the swelling, and if it does get really bad and it's affecting your work and conservative management with pain and the splint don't work, and with physiotherapy, we do uh offer injecting corticosteroids into just right like in the area that you mentioned, right below the thumb.

P: OK. 

D: Um and that often has some effect as well. Um but at first, yeah, let's just do some conservative management and see if that helps. It's only been a few days, so hopefully um what we try first helps. And then we can go on from there.

P: OK yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.

So I want you to flex your thumb, press it up down against your palm. Okay. And then hold your hand. Sorry. No, go ahead. Yeah, and then after you do that, bring your fingers above your thumb, so just cover your thumb. Okay. Kind of like a fist, but your thumb is on the inside of your fingers. Okay. And then bring your arm out. Okay. And with your other hand, can you, from above, push your wrist downwards? So your pinky finger is pointing to the, pointing to the ground. Okay, yep. Yeah, and does that hurt at all? Like when you so this is just called ulnar deviation of your of your wrist? Does that hurt at all? Yes, that is very painful. Okay, that's very painful. Okay. All right. And then you're also having pain with gripping. Okay, so those are kind of all the things I want to ask. It seems that you may be having something called the quarvian's tinosinovitis. It's caused by some repetitive motions. It can be due to gripping. Sometimes it happens to new mothers who are lifting their children as well as daycare workers. It can also happen in other work environments. So what we will first just need to do is we may need to just rule out something like osteoarthritis. You are fairly young, but if there was ever an injury in the past, you can have early osteoarthritis in the area. So we just want to get an x-ray. Other than that, the way we kind of deal with this issue is usually conservatively and with a splint. Okay. And it's a splint for your thumb that helps relieve some of these symptoms, restricts some of your movements, reduces some of the swelling. And if it does get really bad and it's affecting your work and conservative management, the pain and this don't work. And with physiotherapy, we do offer injecting corticosteroids into just right in the area that you mentioned, right below the thumb. And that often has some effect as well. But first, yeah, let's just do some conservative management and see if that helps. It's only been a few days, so hopefully what we try first helps, and then we can go on from there. Okay, yeah, that sounds great. Thank you. You're welcome. Take care. You too.",

P: My father. 

D: OK, so that was everything that I wanted to ask today, was there anything else you wanted to tell me?

P: No, that's it. What do you think I have?

D: Well, it is sounding like it could be most likely an infectious type of process going on with the possibility of having a fever with a cough and sore throat. So we'll do a physical exam and also some investigations which will include a covid test today. Because some of these symptoms do overlap, but it could be something like the common cold. I don't know the virus that's bringing this on but it's not necessarily covid. But because we're doing the test, it will require 14 days of self isolation. We'll get back to you with the results as quickly as we can.

RES0073,/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/BioRAMP/ASR/data/us_medical_20/audio/RES0073.mp3,"D: Would you mind by starting with what brought you in?

P: Yeah, so over the last week I've just been feeling some symptoms. It kind of first started with, like a runny nose. That was around like 5 days ago and then it turned into just a lot of congestion, like around my nose and like my throat. And now over the last two days I've been just feeling so much pressure around my nose and around my jaw so I've been getting a lot of pain there as well.

D: OK, is your nose still running?

P: Yeah, I'm still getting some discharge and I also feel like I'm getting some dripping at the back of my throat too, especially when I wake up.

P: Uh, it's fairly clear and sometimes, like a bit white, but like, it's not like green or yellow.

D: OK, uh, and have you felt that it's difficult to breathe in through either of your nostrils, like it's obstructed?

D: OK, and you have pain. Do you feel it in your jaw or do you feel it in the in the front of your nose?

D: OK, And do you grind your teeth at all at night? or have you had, TMJ issues before?

P: No nothing like that. I think it's not so much on and around my teeth, it's more so just to right below my nose, above my teeth and just around my cheeks.

D: OK, so no pain in your mouth or anything like that?

P: No, not inside my mouth.

D: OK, have you had any fevers or chills?

P: No.

D: And how has your energy been? Any fatigue?

P: Uhm, it's been mainly OK, just maybe sometimes difficult to get to sleep with all the all the congestion, but I don't think my energy has been affected too much, no.

D: OK, and, uh, sorry to go back to this, I don't think I asked. Did you notice any discharge from your eyes or any eye redness?

P: Not discharge, but yeah, maybe a little bit of redness.

D: OK, have your eyes been itchy?

P: Uhm Yeah, a little bit. I would say they have been a bit itchy.

D: OK, alright then, do you have any medical conditions that you see a physician for regularly? 

P: Uh, just uhm, its called dyslipidemia. 

D: OK, I see, and any medications you take for that?

P: Just like a Statin medication.

D: OK, do you take any other medications? over the counter? prescribed?

P: No, other than that I take multivitamins.

D: OK, and do you have any allergies to medications or like environmental allergies that might be getting worse?

P: Uh, no, not that I know.

D: OK, so you don't experience any symptoms like this when the seasons change?

P: I don't think so. I have had this happen to me, Uh, I would say like once before. It happened like two years ago. It was pretty similar. 

D: OK, uhm, and what was done at that time?

P: At that time it kind of just went away on it's own. It got better. I feel it's definitely worse this time. But at that time I didn't even go to the doctor, it kind of just went away.

D: OK, I see. Any recent hospitalizations?

P: No hospitalizations.

D: Any surgeries?

P: Nope. 

D: Alright, and could you tell me where abouts you're living currently and who you're living with?

P: Yeah, so I'm currently living in an apartment by myself, just outside of London.

D: OK, and anybody that you've been around who's had any symptoms?

P: Uh, no, not that I know of.

D: OK, so no sick Contacts. And have you traveled anywhere out of the city or province?

P: No, I've tried to stay home, besides going to work. I just work at the grocery store. Besides that, no, nowhere else.

D: OK, and any of your coworkers have any symptoms? Or any coworkers being off sick?

P: No, we're pretty careful right now with the pandemic.

D: I see, yeah, that's great. OK, and do you smoke cigarettes?

P: No, I quit just a couple of years ago.

D: Oh, that's great. It's not easy to quit, so that's awesome. And do you drink alcohol?

P: Just maybe like red wine a couple of times a week.

D: I see, OK, and do you use any recreational drugs?

D: Alright, and how about any cancer in the family?

P: Uh, no, no cancers.

D: OK, I think I that was everything I wanted to ask about today. Was there any other symptoms or anything else that you wanted to make sure I knew about today?

P: No,  I think that's all. I just didn't know if I needed any, like, medications or if I needed to get tested. I just wanted to make sure.

D: Yeah, so well, certainly check your temperature to see if you have a fever. And if you do and it's high enough, that will increase the chance that you have a bacterial sinusitis,  and if so, with some of your symptoms, including the discharge, obstruction, loss of smell, and facial pain, that all fits the picture for it and also you had a period where you felt a little bit better and then worse again. So that might require antibiotics, but we will check your temperature and go from there.

P: Uhm, not really, it's kind of, I just feel like, it's just more difficult to breathe, uh, most of the time. 

D: And, has this happened to you before?

P: Uhm, not like, no, nothing like this has happened before. 

D: OK, do you have a history of any lung problems?

P: No, I don't, I've been healthy.

D: So no COPD, no asthma, nothing like that,  right?

P: No, nothing like that.

D: OK, so you're just having difficulties breathing for the past three-four days. Do you have any, uh, do you have a cough?

D: And has it been a dry cough or wet cough?

P: I've been bringing up, some, like, uh, whitish sputum. It's like, yeah, whitish or clear.

D: OK, have you had a sore throat?

P: Uh, it's felt a little itchy I guess but no pain with swallowing.

D: And do you have any chest pain or chest pressure?

P: Yeah, when I like, uh, take a deep breath or after after I cough I've been having some chest pain.

D: To give it a number from one to ten, what would you say in terms of how severe it is with ten being the worst pain ever.

P: I would say, maybe six. It feels pretty sharp when it happens and it goes away after a few minutes.

D: OK, and where exactly is it, is the pain?

P: Uh yeah, I kind of feel it, Yeah, just over on the right side of the sternum. 

D: OK. Alright, and does it radiate anywhere? Does it go anywhere other than that one location?

P: No, I feel it just in the one spot.

D: OK, uhm, and has that pain gotten worse overtime?

P: No, that pain started, I guess like two days ago. More recent than the cough or shortness of breath.

D: I see, I see, OK. And so you said that coughing makes it worse and sometimes breathing in. So is it just normal breathing or when you're doing like, deep breathing?

P: Deep breathing. 

D: Deep breathing hurts? OK. Alright, and you've never experienced this before, right?

P: No, I haven't had a pain like this before.

D: OK, when you sort of touch that area over your chest, does touching it make it worse?

D: Yeah, no problem and your throat's been a little bit itchy and then two days ago you also started having this pain in your chest. Is there any other symptom that I have not mentioned that you have been experiencing over the past couple of days?

P: It's just his right ear.

D: Just his right ear, OK. And have you noticed that it's like, swollen, red or warm?

P: Uh, no, I don't see any swelling or redness at all.

D: OK, OK, good, and have you taken a look inside his ears?

D: OK, yeah, that's fair. And you mentioned he's had a runny nose too, When did that start?

P: Yeah, so that, kind of like last week he was recovering from, I think it was just a cold and he had a runny nose and just was a bit congested. But then over the last week it kind of just resolved. But then this week he started having just this ear pain.

D: OK, good. Does he have a sore throat at all?

P: No, not that he's told me. He's still eating things and I don't think he's having any trouble with eating anything, so I don't think so.

D: OK, that's good. Has he had a cough?

P: Uhm, actually he did. He did start coughing like yesterday, but just a few times a day. I don't know if it's because of this or like, what else might be going on.

D: OK, and you said for the past few days, he's had the cough?

P: Yeah, I think just maybe started yesterday.

D: Started yesterday, OK. Is it a dry cough or is it, is he bringing up any phlegm?

D: OK and has he traveled to anywhere recently?

P: Uh, no, like, he's mainly just been inside his home. 

D: OK. has he ever had ear pain before?

P: He did have a similar pain, I think when he was like around three years old, but it happened with his left left ear, not the right one.

D: OK, was he prescribed any medications?

P: Uh yeah, he was given a, like a course of antibiotics at that time. I forgot what it was called, but I think at that time it was much worse, like he, I don't know if he was just younger and couldn't tolerate it but I think he also had a fever at that time.

D: OK, OK, and then any other ear infections outside of that one time.

P: No, I think that, only that one I can recall.

D: OK, alright, is he otherwise healthy?

P: Yeah, otherwise he's healthy. No, other conditions or anything like that.

D: No hospitalizations or surgeries? 

P: No.

D: And is he on any medications?

P: No medications. 

D: OK, is he up to date with all his immunizations?

P: Yeah, all his immunizations are good.

D: OK, any allergies?

P: Not that we know of so far.

D: And any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions.

P: No lung or heart conditions. Just, his father does have like celiac disease, so I don't know if that's related at all.

D: OK, how old was he when was diagnosed with celiac?

P: Fairly young I would say, in his 20s.

D: OK, OK, uhm, alright, we'll keep an eye on it in him, like if he has any changes in his bowel movements or if he's getting severe abdominal pain after eating certain foods with gluten you can get him checked up for that as well.

P: OK. 

D: Yeah and then, in terms of where he lives, does he live with you and your partner?

P: Yeah, so it's just, he's an only child, lives with me and my husband, and also we have like a pet dog.

D: OK, do you live in an apartment or in a house?

P: We live in a, it's like a condominium.

D: OK, OK, any old carpet, mold or asbestos in the building?

P: No, no, nothing like that. It's fairly well kept. 

D: OK, And is he other-wise like developmental-wise, he's OK? There's no past history of like developmental disorders, anything like that?

P: No, no issues from like when he was younger like no complaints at all. I Think he was doing the same as every other child.

D: OK, no complications during your pregnancy with him, no complications during the actual delivery and then when he was a newborn?

P: Uh no, no complications, it was just a vaginal birth at 39 weeks and we didn't need to stay in the hospital at all afterwards.

D: OK, good. So those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?

P: Yeah, I don't know if, uh, like last time we did get some antibiotics. I don't know if he needs them right now or what would you recommend?

D: Yeah, uhm so I'm gonna have to take a look into his ears first before I can come up with like a management plan for him. So once I do, if I see, uhm, if his tympanic membrane has been perforated or I see pus in there, we'll prescribe him like 10 days of antibiotics. We can give him either Amoxicillin, or if he has bad reactions to penicillins,  we can give him Cefuroxime and then if, uh, it doesn't seem to have any systemic symptoms, so if he has systemic symptoms like fever, which we'll check for today, and if he's like been really ill and he has like a middle ear effusion or bulging tympanic membrane, again we'll give him antibiotics for 10 days. But if his tympanic membrane is just bulging a little bit, or if he has some middle ear effusion but no systemic symptoms, like, no fevers, and he seems to be fine otherwise, we'll reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see if he's better and if he's not, again, will prescribe him antibiotics.

P: No, between us two we managed to get the shopping done, the cooking and and all the cleaning, and that sort of thing. I use a walker to get around when we're going longer distances.

D: OK. And currently right now, do you smoke at all?

P: Uh, yes I, I spoke about half a pack per day or maybe even less.

D: OK, and how, how long have you have smoked for?

P: Since I was 15 maybe?

D: OK. 

P: So yeah for like 45 years. 

D: And have you, at all been diagnosed with COPD or anything like that?

P: No, I was tested actually, uh, a couple of years ago and that the results were normal.

D: OK. Alright, and have you thought of quitting at all? I know you've been smoking like for a very long time, but have you at all tried to quit before?

P: Like I've considered it, but I I just don't think it, it'll be possible at this time.

D: OK, well if you at all are wanting any information or want to talk about quitting at all, um, we can provide more resources. Do you besides smoking, do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana?

P: No.

D: No. Any alcohol at all?

P: No.

D: OK. Yeah, so those are some of the questions I had a, I will be doing a physical examination with your shortness of breath. I just want to get a good listen to your lungs and take all your vitals as well. However, yeah so after that since you're having some symptoms of what might be a pneumonia, it can be a bacterial infection, a viral infection, we will have to get some blood work done as well as a chest x-ray. And right now, with the pandemic going on, we will also do Covid swab test for you as well, just in case. Does that sound good?

P: Yeah, that makes sense, thank you.

D: Alright and, if if you're while you're here, if your shortness of breath gets any worse at all, just let us know and we'll help you out.

P: OK, thank you, will do.

P: I do yes I I smoke about a half a pack per day. 

D: For how long?

P: Um, yeah, but I I started in my, yeah, after the kids were born actually, uh so like 10 years ago.

D: OK, have you tried cutting it down at all? 

P: Yeah, I have. I've kind of gone through spurts of quitting and restarting, quitting and restarting. So yeah, I've tried before.

D: OK, and what about marijuana or recreational drugs?

P: No, don't use anything like that.

D: And alcohol? 

P: Yeah I'll have some wine on the on the weekends, but maybe that's like a glass or two.

D: OK, OK uhm, and do you have any medical conditions that long run in the family?

P: Just, uh, yeah, my father actually had a stroke when he was 68, and that's it.

D: OK OK uhm. You haven't ever had one, have you?

P: No, I I haven't had anything like that. 

D: OK, alright. So. I guess come to in terms of smoking, you said that you've tried to quit a couple of times in the past. Do you intend on trying again? I know it can be very hard to, to quit smoking.

P: Yeah, it's only something that is always kind of in the back of my mind.

D: OK, if there's I'm happy to assist you and share resources and problems like medications and things like that that could help you if you're interested so we can talk more about that. talking about your I guess you mentioned that your weight is a little higher than or, its outside the normal range, is that something that you would like to cut down?

P: Yeah, I really try to eat more vegetables and have been trying to do that sort of thing. I've lost a few pounds, but not enough, definitely want to keep going.

D: OK, good good, as long as you feel that you what you're currently doing is helping you and is helping you reduce weight. That's great. But also I'm here for you if you need more education or guidance on that. So, given what you've told me so far, it sounds like you might have developed a clot in your leg somewhere, simply because you had a surgery and you were not moving around very much. Sometimes that causes the blood to kind of, not move around your body is as as much as it usually does, and kind of stays in one place and get turned into a clot and that clot can sometimes get dislodged and settle into your lungs, and that can make it difficult for you to breathe. So, we'll do some tests that that's what my understanding is. Given what you've told me so far, but we do have to confirm it using a test. Also, the fact that you smoke and your weight, and your BMI is high, increases your risk of developing a clot, so I would definitely strongly recommend that you continue to try to reduce both and try to quit smoking. And so we'll do an ultrasound of your leg and we'll do a scan of your chest and see what's going on and then decide if we need to give you any medications, like any blood thinning medications.

P: OK, yeah, that sounds really good. Thank you.

P: Uhm, no, I, no that was everything I think. The only I I guess other thing that that I forgot to mention is that just he doesn't really like his appetite's been a little bit lower couple of days as well. But uh, he hasn't had any, like nausea or vomiting though.

D: OK, OK, yeah, that's good to know. Uhm, so because some of his symptoms overlap with those of Covid, we will do a swab on him and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results and he should isolate for 14 days because of those symptoms. And it doesn't, it sounds more in keeping with the picture of community acquired pneumonia, so for that we will get a chest x-ray, we'll check his oxygen and his temperature and if the chest x-ray shows consolidation umm, or some sort of infiltrate, it is likely that he has pneumonia. So, we will start by giving him some amoxicillin populate or cefuroxime for five days, and just keep monitoring his symptoms. They should resolve in about 5 days when the course of antibiotics is complete. If his condition gets worse like he's getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, just take him to the ER. And if symptoms don't resolve in five to seven days, we can do further work up or things like fungal infections or TB, or things like that. How does that sound?

P: That sounds great. Thank you.

D: OK, yeah, no problem.",642.17,us_medical,"What brings you in? I brought my son in today because he had a fever that started two days ago, and then since then he's had a cough that's started as well, and he's been short of breath. It looks like he's breathing faster and just having a harder time to breathe. Okay. Before the fever, did you notice any other symptoms like a runny nose or a stuffy nose? No, nothing like that. Yeah, the fever kind of came on pretty suddenly. Okay. It seemed like. Okay. And did you take his temperature at home? I did, yeah. It was like 38.7 and then like two days ago and then it was high again like yesterday and today. Okay. And you mentioned the coughing started soon after the fever, correct? Yeah, yeah, kind of like the day after he started getting this cough. Okay. And is it a dry cough or is it a productive cough? It's he is bringing up a little bit of sputum. Yeah, okay. What color is the sputum? It's maybe like greenish, greenish yellow. Greenish yellow. Okay. Any blood in there? No, I haven't noticed any blood. Okay. And does he seem short of breath or wheezy? No wheezing, but he does have some shortness of breath. Okay. And the shortness of breath started with a cough? It did, yeah. Okay. How much shortness of breath is he having? Is it just when he's exerting himself or is it at rest as well? I'd say even at rest now, he's like breathing faster. Okay. And does anything help with that? So does sitting up help or getting fresh air or anything like that? No. But you'd say like taking smaller breaths helps because if he takes a deep breath, then he gets like chest pain. Okay. Okay. And how about when he's laying down? No, he hasn't said anything like that for laying down. Just I think when he's just taking a deep breath, he said. Okay. Is it waking him up from sleep? No. No, okay. How about chest pain? Yeah, so yeah, he's had some pain when he just when he takes that deep breath in. Okay. Does he ever feel like his heart's racing? No. No, okay. How about dizziness or fainting spouse? No, he hasn't had anything like that. Okay. Has he had a sore throat? No. No. Any changes in vision or hearing? No. Smell or taste? No. No. Weight loss? No, he's been gaining weight well. Okay. How about any rashes? Nope, I haven't noticed any. Hmm. Okay. And then any numbness or tingling? No, he hasn't said anything like that. Okay, muscle aches or joint aches? No. Okay. Confusion or memory loss? No. Changes in his bowel movements? Nope, that's been good. No diarrhea or anything like that. Okay. Changes in his voiding? Nope, he hasn't had any urinary problems. Okay. And is he an otherwise healthy child? Does he have any long-standing medical conditions? No, he doesn't. This one was so surprising. He's been healthy. Okay. So he's never had any hospitalizations or surgeries? No, he hasn't. Okay. How about his mother's pregnancy with him? Were there any complications at that point? Nope. Everything went well. No complications. And he was like at a good birth weight and went home right away. Okay. Okay. And how about the delivery itself? Any complications during that point? Oh, no. It was a vaginal delivery and it was normal. Okay. And he didn't need to be hospitalized as a newborn for anything like jaundice or shortness of breath? No, he hasn't had any reason to be hospitalized. Okay. All right. And has he been hitting all his developmental milestones as well as like his height, weight, and head circumference, milestones? He has, yeah. He's been growing well and reaching the development milestones. Okay. Is he on any medications? No, he's not on any medications. Okay. Any allergies? No allergies. Is he up to date with all his immunizations? He is, yeah. Okay. Any family history of lung or heart conditions? No, nothing like that. Okay. How about cancers in the family? No, no, no cancers, luckily. Can you think of anyone he's been in contact with who's also been sick? Yeah, maybe he has a younger sister that goes to daycare and she was sick last week with like she had a cough and stuff as well. Okay. Okay. And does she have a fever as well? She did, yeah. She got better last week. We had to take her to see the doctor and she got antibiotics for that actually for a few days. Okay. Okay. And have you traveled anywhere recently? No, we've been at home. Okay. Does anyone at home smoke? No. No, okay. And who lives at home with him? So it's me, his mom, and then his younger sister. Okay. Any old carpets, mold, dust, asbestos, anything that could exacerbate his condition? No, I don't think so. It's a newer home. Okay, good. So those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own? No, no, that was everything, I think. The only, I guess, other thing that I forgot to mention is that he hasn't really, like his appetite's been a little bit lower these last couple days as well.

RES0217,/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/BioRAMP/ASR/data/us_medical_20/audio/RES0217.mp3,"D: So I understand you removed insects from your leg earlier today?

P: Yes I did, it was uh it was behind my left uh knee kind of in like the joint behind where it bends. Um it was stuck pretty good, it's still kind of red and tender there. I noticed it because the back of my knee was starting to just feel a bit sore, um not the joint itself, but just kind of the skin, the whole area back there. Um and I found this tick, I brought I brought it in with me if you wanted to have a look at it, um it's in like this little plastic container, uh and I don't really know when I got it. I was hiking on Friday um and then Saturday I was out in my garden, I hope they're not around my house, I hope that it was from hiking um and not gardening, but uh I did spend a lot of time outside on Saturday as well.

D: OK, so sounds like it's been a little bit of time since you were last outdoors to when you first noticed it?

P: Yeah.

D: OK, so when you picked it off the tick, obviously you have it for me, is it quite swollen or engorged?

P: It's not too bad, um I I have actually had a tick in the past and this is a long time ago and um maybe like 10 years and I actually had that kind of target rash thing that they talk about. And, uh at that time I remember I had to take antibiotics for a bit. Um this um didn't look like that, it was more, it was just kind of sore in one spot, I don't think it um it was as bad as that time and the tick that time, sorry I've kind of gotten off track, that time it was quite swollen, this one was maybe a little bit, but not as much.

D: OK, so just in terms of the tick's size, it doesn't look like it's been feeding for too long, so when ticks uh are feeding they tend to engorge, they tend to swell up, so this looks more like a tiny little bug or does it kind of look like a little grape, almost like it's been swollen up with blood?

P: No, this one, this one's pretty small.

D: This one's pretty small, OK. And I should mention that, well obviously you've had a tick bite in the past, the big concern for us is a disease called Lyme disease, which is spread by bacteria, but in fact only one type of tick predominantly is a transmission transmitory agent for it. It's called a deer tick, and its coloration, it's got a little bit of a brown butt and there's some black legs. Does it look like that at all?

P: I don't think so, uhm, I uh I was looking at the pictures online, I think it looks like the other kind of tick, um but I heard that, yeah, but I heard that lately now they've been considering all ticks in this area as possibly carriers of Lyme um because I think it's kind of become more more of a problem sm so that was making me a bit nervous.

D: OK, absolutely, what we can do is we can send this tick off to the lab and they'll be able to identify the species for it, but for tick bites in general, one of the key considerations is for how long it's been on your body for. So unfortunately, if you're out on Friday and Saturday, that'd mean that this tick has been on you for longer than at least 72 hours. So I think one way or another, we're likely going to have to put you on antibiotics just as kind of a prophylactic at the very least, just want to make sure that um you're not at risk of developing Lyme disease. I'm sure you've heard from the news that Lyme disease can present in a variety of ways, but it's a disease that we try our best to avoid. And just in terms of your symptoms, so you say you've had a bite in the past and you you've got that rash before, that kind of bullseye rash, do you have that rash now?

P: No, I don't uh as far as I know, I mean, you can have a look too. It's behind my knee, so it's not the easiest place to see, but it's uh it looks a little red, it's like tender where the tick was, but I don't see that like larger circle rash.

D: OK, that's reassuring. Now any, it'd be pretty unlikely for you to have other symptoms, but just in case, do you have any other joint pain? 

P: No.

D: Have you been feeling ill or have been feverish in the last little while?

P: No, no, I've been fine.

D: OK, and you removed that twit tick once you found it, you presented to me, have you checked your body for any other possible bites?

P: Oh yeah, I looked around and I looked at my husband too 'cause we we were just a little bit, you know, gave us a little bit of a scare, but no, there's been nothing else.

D: That's good. And did you bring a pet with you at all when you were hiking and gardening?

P: Uh no, I didn't, no.

D: OK, good. Any other family members you think might have been exposed?

P: Uh no it was just uh me and my husband.

D: OK, and what geographic area were you in um when you were hiking?

P: We were uh in Strathroy along the creek.

D: OK. I can do, if I remember there's a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario and we can see exactly how that lines up to see if we should be a little bit concerned or not. Looks like Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point, so I think that we will be moving forward with antibiotics, but of course we'll be talking to the physician who'll be having a look at you as well. So it sounds like you haven't been having too much symptoms aside from you've noticed this tick, the skin around it is fairly sore and you've had this in the past, but you were treated with antibiotics in the past and since then you haven't had too many health problems after that?

P: No, no. I've been pretty healthy.

D: OK, and just about your health right now, is there anything that you see the family physician or doctor for in general and regarding your health?

P: Uh just for my cholesterol.

D: OK, are you taking and medications for that?

P: Uh Yeah, I take a uh statin, can't remember which one. 

D: OK, got it. And do you have any allergies?

P: Uh no.

D: So no drug allergies?

P: No.

D: OK, now we've already talked about other exposures, so it doesn't sound like anyone else in your family or any pets are around, so it's unlikely that you have ticks coming in and you said you might have gotten this from gardening, but um you're hoping that your area doesn't have ticks. Maybe just take a look, ticks like to live in long grass, kind of on the intersection between woods and fields to see if there's any hovering around that kind of make a waving motion with their legs and they're sometimes easy to spot, you might wanna get some insecticide out there. But it sounds like this is fairly recent, unfortunately just for the length of time this tick might be on you for, it's probably safer than not to start you on some medications, but I'm going to go talk to the doctor after we do a quick physical exam, and we might also send the tick off to a local laboratory so they can identify the species for it definitively, as well as might just send some blood work just to see if there's any titres or any serology that would make us a little bit more concerned for Lyme disease. But aside from that you've been feeling well otherwise?

P: Yeah, totally fine. It was just a little tender there and that's the only reason I looked.

D: OK. So no headaches?

P: No.

D: Nothing like that?

P: Nothing like that. 

D: OK, excellent, alright. I'm fairly happy with what we talked about today. Do you have any questions for me Jean? 

P: No, this is pretty well what I expected today, so thanks for helping me out.

D: No problem. OK, I'll go talk to the doctor, we'll come back and talk to you, OK?
