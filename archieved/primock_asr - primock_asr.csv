Hello, can you hear me okay? Okay, great. I am, yes. Dr. Seod here, Oscar. How can I help you this afternoon? Okay. Do you want to tell me a bit more about it? So, when did it all start? Okay. Okay. Okay. Is there anything you're particularly worried about? Okay. Right. Right, okay. So you mentioned you've been feeling short of breath for the last couple of weeks, but maybe the last couple of days has got a bit worse. And you're now feeling more breathless on kind of minimal exertion, you mentioned. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all with your breath? So, for example, any pain in your chest? Okay. Have you found yourself coughing at all? Okay. Okay. And how's your general health otherwise? Are you feeling weak, lethargic? Okay. Okay. And what do you mean by that? Okay. Is that both angles? Both ankles? Okay, I can imagine, yeah. And again, over how long have you noticed this for? Last few days, okay. And is this something that you've had before in the past? Okay, okay. Fine, okay. So just to really recap, so really the last couple of weeks, you've been feeling breathless, but worse in the last couple of days. You mentioned you had a bit of a dry cough and some swelling in your ankles, but importantly no chest pain. And have you noticed your heartbeat racing at all? So palpitations or skipped heartbeat? Okay. And any temperatures or fevers? Okay. And how about your appetite? Are you eating and drinking okay? Okay, and your water works. Are you passing urine okay? Yeah, sure. Okay, all right. Fine, so moving on to your past medical history, you mentioned heart failure. Any other medical history I should be aware of. Okay. Okay. And when you say small heart attack, did they give you a name for what happened? A name of a diagnosis? Okay, was it like angina or okay? Okay. You've been okay since then. Okay, all right. So apart from the heart, the heart problems, the heart failure, any other problems I should be aware of? Okay. Do you take any regular medications apart from your diuretics that you're taking? Do you know which ones? Do you know which dose you're taking? No problems. Any other medications? Okay. That metopola was it? Sorry, the connection is not very good. Okay, thank you. Yep. Great. Okay. All right. Any allergies at all? Any medications? No. Okay. Anything in the family that's that's that's important for me to know any family history or medical problems, heart problems, lung problems? I'm sorry to hear that. And how old was your father when he passed away? He's 60, so okay. Anything else I should be aware of? Okay. Is your mother still with us? Okay, all right. And socially, sir, just tell me a bit more about your situation at home. Who lives at home with you? You've got two cats. Okay, great. Do they have names? Okay. So this is you and your cats. And in terms of day to day, are you working at the moment? Okay, and how is that? Is that quite stressful? Long hours? Yeah, this is certainly a consideration, isn't there? So let's try and get you better soon so it doesn't have any impact on your job. And do you find yourself doing a lot of antisocial hours? Do you do a lot of night driving, weekend driving? Okay. Okay. All right. And what about smoking and alcohol, so? Because they can sometimes be very important when it comes to heart problems. So do you smoke at all? So you used to smoke. How many did you smoke a day on average? And how many years was that for? Okay. Well done for stopping. I must have been very difficult for you, but well done for stopping. And what about alcohol? Okay. Do you do much in the way of exercise, sir? Okay. Okay. Right, okay. And certainly now with your symptoms, you said you're feeling more breathless even walking to the shop, she said. Right. So based on your based on your history and having listened to your story, I wonder whether you've had a flare-up of your heart failure, sir, which can sometimes happen. So it seems like your heart's not pumping as well as it should be. And obviously having diagnosed with heart failure, there's obviously the first thing that comes to my mind. Now there's a couple of options to move forward. Given that you're otherwise well at the moment and having examined you, your chest and your saturations and blood pressure all okay, I'm quite happy to increase your dose of fruzamide. So maybe rather than one tablet day, we can give you two tablets a day for the first few days and see how you're getting on. I think it's definitely worth treating your symptoms, but what we should also think about is maybe doing a couple of other tests like a blood test and maybe an echocardiogram of your heart to see how well your heart's pumping. Is that something you've had? Yeah, so an echo scan, it's a jelly scan if you're holding. You may have had it done before when you were diagnosed and it's just to get a good sorry okay fine. That's something I can organise for you today and they may take a week or two weeks for that to be organized. But I think certainly in the meantime let's let's let's get a blood test done. We can check your full blood can look for signs of anemia. We can have a check of your kidney function and we can definitely increase your fruzamide to you know one tablet twice a day. But I really like would like you'd come back and see me in about a week's time to see how you're getting on. Does that sound reasonable? And of course in the meantime if you are getting more unwell, so if you're getting more breathless or you're having any other symptoms like chest pain or palpitations or dizziness, then you know I want you to give me a call sooner than that and we can have a chat on the phone as well. Okay, do you have any questions for me? Great no, I wish you all the best. Have a good day. Okay, thank you.","Hello there. Yes, I can hear you. Are you the doctor? I'm contacting you because I've been quite short of breath lately. Well, it seems to have been slowly getting worse over the last couple of weeks. It's become quite troublesome in the last few days. I kind of normally can walk to the shops without a problem, but now I'm having to sort of sit down and catch my breath. And I'm even starting to get a bit breathless just about the house. And it's got me kind of worried. I don't really know what's going on. Well, I've got heart failure. I was told that a while ago. And I got a bit breathless when I was first diagnosed and put on some medicine that helped, but I'm a bit worried it's just getting worse. No pain in my chest. I've got a bit of a dry cough, but it's not too troublesome. I'm feeling a little run down, but otherwise, otherwise, pretty normal. I've noticed my ankles have got a bit bigger. It's just like they've sort of swollen up a bit. Kind of yeah, both ankles. Yeah, it's a bit embarrassing. I kind of noticed it the last few days. I think my ankles did swell up a bit last time. The heart failure was a problem. No, not really. No. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, that, yeah. I usually pee a lot ever since the drugs. Well, I was told I had like a, they called it like a small heart attack about five years ago. I had I had like a chest pain and they took me to hospital and they but then I just got better I can't remember. They just called it something like that, a small heart attack. No, they said they it seemed it was like more than angina. But I didn't, but I only had to stay in hospital for a few days and yeah, I've been okay since then. No, I think I'm otherwise I'm okay. Yeah, I take something called ferrozemide. I can't remember. I'm sorry, doctor. I have to check. Yeah, I take aspirin and zoprololprolol. And Simbastatin. No, no allergies. My father died of a heart attack. He was early 60s. My mother had osteoporosis. Yes, she's still living. I live on my own. I've got two cats. They're my family. They're called Polly and Tim. I work part-time as a lorry driver. It's okay. Yeah, like when I'm working, it's pretty exhausting. I guess I'm a bit worried that if I get sick, if I get more sick, then I won't be able to work properly. Oh no, I only take shifts during the day. I don't like working at night. Not anymore. Yeah. Ooh, it was about a pack a day back in the day. Oh, that was a good 25 years. I don't drink alcohol. I try and walk to the shops at least once a day. But that's about it. Yeah, I don't I don't go running like I used to when I was young that what's going on Okay, if you think that would be best Okay, what does that remember now Yeah, I remember now I think that sounds like a good plan Okay, I'll see how I get on that's all pretty clear thank you very much doctor see you soon",hello hello can you hear me okay okay great i am yes dr sud here oscar um how can i help you today okay okay and what about smoking and alcohol though because it can sometimes be very important when it comes to heart problems so do you smoke at all and how many did you smoke a day on average um and how many how many years was that for um and certainty now your symptoms you said you're feeling more breathless even walking to the shop you said um and see and see how you're getting on um i think it's it's definitely worth treating your symptoms but what we should also think about is maybe doing a couple of other tests like a blood test and maybe an echo cardiogram of your heart you may have had it done before when you were diagnosed and it's just to get a good um sorry now okay fine that's something i can organize for you today and it may take a week or two,hello there yes i can hear you are you the doctor i'm contacting you because i've been quite short of breath lately uh well it seems to have been slowly getting worse over the last couple of weeks um and it's become quite troublesome in the last few days uh i kind of normally i can walk to the shops without a problem but now i'm having to sort of sit down and catch my breath and i'm even starting to get a bit breathless just about the house and uh it's got me kind of worried i don't really know what's going on uh i think that's all i can think of i think that's all i can think of i think that's all i can think of thank you very much doctor okay see you soon uh i think that's all pretty clear thank you very much doctor okay see you soon

Uh over the last, has it, has it been affecting your work? Mm, OK. Is that stress, is that affecting your um, your mood at all any, in any way? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> OK.

Um had initial fever, but now settled. Um I don't think there's a lot to worry about. I think you probably have, you know a bit of a viral, what we say viral illness, maybe a viral upper respiratory tract infection, or maybe early signs of a flu. Um these normally last about seven to days and just gets better really, um over time. But things you can do to really help yourself, um is get plenty of rest. I'd probably advise you taking a day or two off work if you can. Um Making yourself, <UNIN/> pushing fluids and make yourself well-hydrated. Continue with the regular Paracetamol, Ibuprofen. Um and and you should see how things go, really. Um if next week you're still not better, I'd like you to come back and see me. Um is that clear? Does that, does that make, does that make <UNIN/> Yeah, <UNSURE>yeah</UNSURE>. <UNIN/> and things to look out for if you're really not getting better, if you if you have a high fever, or your breathing is becoming a bit more labored, or chest pain, I'd like you to come back and see me much sooner, give me a call. Um and <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> we can help you out. OK? Great. Have a great day. Good luck with your work. Thank you. <UNSURE>Bye bye. Bye bye.</UNSURE>","<INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> <UNSURE>Yeah</UNSURE>.

Um it started with the um, uh sore throat and runny nose, and It's sort of, um, it's sort of going into a cough now. Um, the sort throat is kind of going away, but, um, <UNIN/> I'm starting to cough. And uh <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> kind of uh bad and tired. Um ,so I, I <UNIN/>, you know I think I, it all started with, uh, this colleague of mine, she just kept sneezing next to me, all the time. I think her kids are catching something from the uh from their kindergarten or something. And uh, you know the it it started as normal sore throat, and uh was quite painful for a couple days, but then it was past. Um yeah. Yeah it was uh, it was quite painful to swallow, <UNIN/> for one or two days. Um no, not really. Um No. Um I I didn't think about uh <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. Yeah yeah, it's uh it's <UNSURE>clearing up</UNSURE> <UNIN/>. Sort of um, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> sort of getting my nose stuffed all the time. It's very had to, uh to get it free. Yeah, quite congested. Um yeah that started recently, like just uh um maybe yesterday. And um it's uh, it's dry for now, it's it's not very painful but it's sort of there, all the time. Sorry? Um No it's it's um, it's sort of, it's sort of constant. Um I forgot to mention, that um I'm also having uh night sweats. <UNSURE>That's</UNSURE>, that's very odd actually. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> makes me a bit tired, um makes my <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> uneasy. Yeah, yes. Um I I had some some fever in the beginning, but it's now sort of uh going down. I I've been taking some Paracetamol and Ibuprofen for that, and uh they, they help. Um so no pain in chest, but uh I noticed that I um um so I feel a bit winded on exertion. So if I I <UNIN/> I haven't been going, going to the gym thus uh, because of that. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> yeah. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Yeah, yeah. When when when I'm resting it's OK. So <UNIN/> I've been actually going to work, um sort of managing. Um no. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> No, I don't think so. Um, yeah, yeah. That that's still, that's still there. Um it's sort of general. Uh and uh <UNIN/> they're not, they're not always there, but you know every now and then they will come and go. Um no. No, I don't think so. No, none of that. Uh yeah, yeah. Think so. Yeah, yeah. Yeah I've been, I've been drinking a lot more than the usual. But uh so <UNIN/> other than that, so <UNIN/> Um maybe a bit less than uh than what I, I would usually have. Um no, no. Yeah, yeah. Yeah that's, that sort of started in the past couple days. Um, so otherwise that, uh, I'm I'm fine. There's um, there isn't anything that I'm taking or, I'm being treated for. <UNSURE>Um</UNSURE> Um, no <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Um, yeah my grandma has diabetes. Um, and, my grandma. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> I think <UNIN/>, I think it's type two. Yeah, I, I think um, one of my uh, great grandads had an eczema. Ohh um, I live alone. Yeah, yeah. I'm an, I'm an accountant. Um, a little bit. I've been a bit slower. And you know, it's uh, it's, it's a bit of a stressful period just around the um, end of the year. Right. Um, no I think I think it's, it's the, you know it's the good kind of stress. It's um, it's good work. I don't know. I, I like my job. It's just you know, it's a bit more work than usual. Um, yeah occasionally, you know, cigars and things on company parties. No. Um, occasionally yeah I would have some. I'm, I'm not a very big drinker. Yeah.

Do you think I should keep going to work? Or do you think I should just OK. OK. Thank you. OK. But otherwise, I don't need to worry. OK. Alright. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Hello. Before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your date of birth? You're 50, okay. April, how can I help you this afternoon? Right, I do. Okay, when did it all start? Okay, and you mentioned a couple of things there. You mentioned a cough, you mentioned a bit of a runny nose, that right? Okay, let's focus on your cough first. Can you tell me a bit more about your cough? Okay, so it's a dry cough, so you're not bringing up any you're not bringing up any more. Oh, I can hear that, yeah. You're not bringing up any mucky phlegm or anything like that. No, okay, so keep shop at night. Um, you mentioned uh the cold symptoms as well, the runny nose. Do you have a sore throat at all? Right. Do you have any? Um, do you are you how are your ears? Your ears feel blocked or no pain or discharge from your ears. Okay, all right. Um, fine. In terms of your breathing, um, how's your breath? How's your chest? Is your breathing more laboured? Day today, when you walk around, you don't feel breathless, do you? Okay, okay. Any pain in your chest? Okay, you mentioned feeling tired. Um, have you felt feverish at all? Have you had a temperature? No, okay, okay, all right. Um, fine. In terms of any other symptoms, so have you had any nausea? Have you had any vomiting? How's your appetite? Okay, I got better now, the diarrhea. Okay, fine. Um, any problems with your water works at all? Your water works, your urine passing urine, okay? You're drinking plenty of fluids and passing urine, okay? Okay, all right. Um, in terms of any other things, you notice any funny skin rashes or um problems with your muscles or joints, yeah, okay, right, right, okay, okay. I'm sorry, that must be very difficult for you getting quite lethargic and weak. Mentioned, okay, and um, April, are you normally otherwise fitting well? Uh, fitting well, so do you have any other medical history? Okay, okay, and what do you take for your blood pressure? Any medications do you take on a regular basis? Shall I say yep, cinnabrela? Okay, fine. Any allergies at all to medications? No, okay. Regarding any family history, is there anything I should be aware of? Okay, all right. Who's looking after your diabetes? Is there anyone? Do you have a doctor in the hospital who just stops your diabetes? Great, excellent. In terms of your social situation, who lives at home with you? Okay, fine. Is your partner well at the moment? Right, okay. Oh, wait, he's got away with it at the moment. Okay, and are you working at the moment, April? Yeah. No, I can imagine. What is it that you do for work? Oh, so you work in the IT field? Okay. Right, okay. No, has it been quite stressful recently? The reason I ask is sometimes some reason I ask is sometimes stress can really affect your immune system. But it's good to know you're not feeling stressed. Do you smoke at all, April? Okay. And what about alcohol? And what is it that you drink? And how much do you drink on those nights? Okay, so yeah, so you're probably just about under the limit of the recommended limit. Something maybe to think about just because of your blood pressure and diabetes. Maybe something that you can maybe cut down on if you can really ideally the right answer is to cut down completely, but in practice, I know that's not realistic. So maybe for the first few weeks, one you can't add to two glasses a week and then one week thereafter. And if you are coping okay, then we can maybe try and cut down altogether. Okay, just something for you to think about. Right, so just as we wrap up, really, April, I think based on your story, I think essentially I think you're going through a bit of a bit of a viral illness. I don't think there's anything to worry about. You know, you've had a bit of a cough, bit of a runny nose, feeling quite weak and lethargic. I'm hoping that you're probably over the worst of it now. It's been five days. I'm hoping you're maybe going to get better the next couple of days. It normally lasts for a week to 10 days. Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, things you can do to help yourself in the meantime is to, you know, get some nice good rest, drink plenty of fluids, keep yourself well hydrated. You can take a regular paracetamol. If you feel like it's still not getting any better in two to three days, it's probably worth coming back to see me again. We can check you over. And if you are still feeling feverish and your cough isn't getting any better, then we may look to give you some antibiotics for your chest, which can sometimes be a common source of infection. Yeah, so I think it really, I think it depends on you. If you are coughing, then there is a theatrical risk that you're maybe slightly infectious still. So I would say maybe take a day or two off work if you can and get some good bed rest and maybe think about work early next week. But if your cough isn't getting any better or your breathing is getting worse, I want you to come back and see me sooner, okay? No, no, nothing, nothing to worry about otherwise. Okay, great. Have a good day. Appreciate it.","Hello. Yeah, my name is April and I'm 60. Well, I've just been having this like cough for quite a few days and my nose is running. I've just been super annoying and it's not going away. I think it started like maybe a bit less than a week ago, like maybe five or six days ago. Yeah. Yeah. It's just so continuous. It's really, really frustrating. It's quite dry and it's just all day, like keeps me up at night as well, which is really annoying. I don't know. I mean, apart from, I mean, the coughing is giving me a sore throat, but it's not like, you know, not more than that. You know, just my throat is irritated from coughing, but it's not like, it's not that bad when I swallow or anything. No, they feel okay, actually. Yeah. Not pain on the ears. I don't think so. Like, I guess like it's labored when I'm coughing and I can't breathe, but like, not, yeah, I don't think so. I don't feel breathless. No, I feel, you know, generally tired. So like, yeah, but not anything special with my chest. No, not that either. I've been having like shivers, even when I'm in bed. You know, like when you go to sleep and you feel like I should be warm, but I'm still, you know, shivering a little bit. But I haven't seen my temperature, so I'm not 100% sure if I had a fever, but it feels like I probably did because I was just, I was next to my boyfriend and he was completely warm and totally fine. And I just couldn't stop shivering and kept adding more sweaters on and I was still cold. No, no, no nausea, no vomiting, but yeah, nothing like that. I mean, it's okay. At the beginning, like when I was starting to have the coughing and stuff, I had a little bit of diarrhea, but it didn't cut my appetite or anything. I just like my stomach wasn't feeling great. Yeah, yeah, it got better. It was only like the first, like it started at the same time as the cough started and then it stopped. So I thought everything would be fine. But then the coughs just stopped going. With my what? Oh, no, no, no, that's fine. Yeah, I drank loads of water when I started having the diarrhea. Now that it stopped, I just went back to normal. Like my, you know, when I have this, when I was telling you, I had like the, I had chills and I was really cold. My muscle was really hurting. So I try to do Pilates, but like it's hurting me so much at the moment. So to be honest, all I feel like doing is just lying in bed. Yeah, right. Especially like my arms, my legs, like just everywhere basically. Yeah, pretty much. Am I normally wet? Well, I have type 2 diabetes and I have quite high blood pressure. I take metformin for the diabetes and I take lithonopril for the high blood pressure. No allergies. My dad also has type 2 diabetes, but I think that's it. I just regularly go see a doctor and just checks up on it. Same with the high blood pressure. Like I have it under control. And since I've started taking this medication, I've just been like regularly checking that it's under control. It's just me and my partner. Yeah, he has none of this. Like he's just going ahead, like nothing. Like I was a bit worried that I would pass it to him, but not the diarrhea, nothing. He's fine. Yeah, I am working, but the first day I skipped because I was feeling just too shit. But then I just felt like I had to go back because I had so much to do. I've been going in, but it's not been fun. I am a developer. Yeah, work in IT. Okay, not too active a job. Not more than usual. I don't think it's related to stress. Like I don't feel like I've had a particularly hard time at work currently. I've been able to take a day off to try and recover. So yeah, I don't think I'm related. I used to, but I've stopped for about six months now. I mean, yeah, I don't think I drink that much. I don't really know how you count the units, but I guess like I don't drink more than like say three evenings a week and I rarely get like properly drunk or anything. Wine mostly. I'd say like maybe two or three glasses. Yeah? How much do you think I should cut down on it? Okay. Yeah. What should I do if it just keeps going on and on? Like if it's still going on in say four days. Do you think I should keep going to work or do you think I should just Okay, okay. Thank you. Okay, but otherwise I don't need to worry. Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you. Bye.",hello hello before i go any further can i confirm your name and your date of birth,

I threw up once, <UNIN/> that <UNSURE>was a</UNSURE> little worrying, uh. I threw up once, <UNSURE>yeah</UNSURE>. Uh, nothing else was worrisome. Uh, four to five. Uh, what do you mean? It probably depends on the time of day to be honest, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. No blood. What do you mean mucus? In the stool? No. Uh, maybe a little bit, but. It hasn't been, that in particular hasn't been too worrying. Uh, a little bit of.

Mostly it's <UNSURE>been dry and red</UNSURE>. Nothing yet. Uh, nothing yet. Uh, I. Probably I <UNIN/> <UNSURE>I had</UNSURE> asthma. Um or, or I don't know I guess I still have it.

Hello. Nice to meet you too. So just before we start, is it alright if you could confirm your name for me, please? And your date of birth. Okay. And your address for me, please. Okay, and that's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. Okay. You've mentioned on our notes that you're suffering from bad diarrhea. I'm sorry to hear about it. So if you tell me a bit more about it, please. Okay. So you haven't had anything from outside, nothing dodgy, anything? No. Repeat that, please. That wasn't clear. What did you say? One, after that, we said something. Okay, right. And with the diarrhea, how many times a day are you going to the toilet? Four to five times. Yeah. And is there any, and it's like water? Is it like water or is it just loose? Are you going like water or is it just you know bit bit of solid stools bit loose kind of thing bit of both and is there any blood or mucus? It's like the snotty stuff Yeah, it looks like snot do you no so no mucus okay any fever at all are you still able to eat and drink okay sure so but you're you're still able to drink quite a bit yeah you're drinking plenty okay excellent okay and um what have you taken have you taken anything so far for the diarrhea nothing yet okay anything for the abdominal pain okay right and any unfortunately we don't have any of your past medical history is there anything you'd like to say okay and are you any anything else other than asthma okay yeah oh dear okay oh cancer 10 years ago and how old was he when he died okay and um you mentioned you had asthma are you using any inhalers at all which ones sorry laxipro okay not heard of it maybe is it like salbutamal is it like a blue color yellow okay i'll have to check that one not sure lacid pro okay um that's fine any other medication that you're using over the counter anything at all regularly now okay right any allergies no allergies at all right here fine so obviously you know you just have diarrhea it's about four to five times a day um you're still drinking plenty and you look like you're not dehydrated which is a good sign okay um when we start worrying about diarrhea is if you're going more than eight times a day that means probably you are you know whatever you're eating is going straight through okay you still need to drink plenty of water because you're losing a lot of fluids okay when you go to the toilet things that one would advise is a soft diet so avoid dairy fish meat eggs while you're having the diarrhea go sorry okay so that will be like crackers toast jam those kind of things that's easily digested like what you would give babies yeah when they start eating you give simple food for babies you don't give eggs or meat the first time they start feeding so that's the kind of soft diet we're talking about yeah once you are able to you know keep most of it in you can start off with some just boil vegetables and mash once you're okay with that for about 48 hours then you can start having meat so just don't have meat immediately once you feel like you're slightly better because you might go back to square one again all right for 48 hours you're not having any diarrhea you're fine then you can go and start having meat egg fish and all so that should be when you no no no you preferably just it don't because why do we say this it's because it takes much more time for meat to get digested so because your gut flora you know the the the bacteria in your gut is not you know as it should be it takes a bit more effort for one to digest these food while it doesn't take that much of an effort to you know digest mash and vegetables does that make sense yeah so um at the same time you could have some although you can't milk is not a good idea yogurts are a good idea because they are probiotics it help to build up the normal um gut bacteria back okay so those kind of now things to look out for if your diarrhea doesn't go away in a week's time or if you're passing blood we need a stool sample because that means you might you may have some um some particular bugs that might need treatment with antibiotics okay if you're again as i've mentioned previously if you're going about six to eight times a day that means there's a high chance that um you are having dehydration and you might need to go into hospital at that point in time if that happens do get in touch with us again all right any questions you look a bit confused yeah okay and also you could get something called diary over the counter so it helps to uh replenish your the salts that you've been that's lost through going to the toilet okay if you're a bit confused you know you can actually all this is all recorded in your app so you can go back i'll put that all in detail so if you know i know sometimes it's a bit difficult to process everything you can go back and read read the notes is that okay all right then you take care bye now","Hello, nice to meet you, Michael Johnson 0929831 Leonard London Street, or sorry, London.

So, as much as you can, 'cause that really does make a difference to injuries. <UNSURE>Brings</UNSURE> the healing blood into the area, and it gives it the best chance of, getting better. So, as much as you can, use the ice. Um, obviously you're trying to stick to a marathon programme, but. Um, I would, try and ease up on the running, if you can. And if it, if it's painful enough that you're, having to stop running, then it's not a good idea, to do that. Um. It's fine to take the Ibuprofen. Um, I can prescribe you a slightly stronger, anti-inflammatory that you can take regularly instead of the Ibuprofen, but not with the Ibuprofen. But make <UNSURE>sure</UNSURE> that with food. Ultimately we probably need to, examine the knee. Um, so, the best thing I would, suggest, getting a appointment with the physiotherapist first, who can do like a long, assessment, and examination of the knee. And then <UNSURE>we can</UNSURE> make an assessment as to whether we need to do any, um, imagery to <UNIN/>, have a look inside the knee, and see if there's any problem with the, cartilage. Um, it's, it's not really possible to, diagnose that over the <UNIN/>, over the video. So we definitely would need to, see you. And, the, a physio is the best point of call, because they'll probably be the most likely initial treatment. But certainly if the appointment time's too long to wait, then we can see, we can see you <UNSURE>in</UNSURE> our clinic as well. Yep, <UNIN/> we can, we can do a referral before that. If in the meantime you develop like persistant swelling, heat, redness, um, of the knee, or high temperature, feel unwell, or it completely locks up and you can't bend and stretch it. Then, you'd need to see a doctor urgently, so call us back <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> in that, case. <UNIN/>. OK. I'll send it through to your pharmacy for you. OK? Thank you, bye.","Hi. Hi Doctor Smith. Yes. My name is Mary Jo. Date of birth is January first, nineteen eighty. And my address is uh, sixty Sloane Avenue, London. <UNSURE>Absolutely</UNSURE>. So, a couple of things. I, I, think I may have, overdone my workouts, and now my knees are hurting, and they're clicking a lot, and it's starting to worry me. Um, I can't run very far, um, any more without just feeling, pain in my knees. And then, sometimes I also get this weird tingling in my toes. Um. So yeah, that's, that's it. I'm just concerned and I figured you know I'd call and, see if you can, help me figure out what's going on. So probably, it's been about two weeks. You know not, not really. I mean I play a lot of sports. Um, and I had a <UNIN/>, like I play some ice hockey, and I had this injury a few months ago. You know I just like, fell on the ice and, and, you know had a, huge bruise but, I think that's about it. So I'm training, well, I'm currently training for a marathon, um, that's gonna happen in, June. And so, I'm trying to run like. I mean right now, I'm actually not even doing such long runs, maybe like seven or eight miles. And so, I started about uh, maybe a month ago. Uh, I've done like, you know, four or five miles, and I've just done like a couple of seven, mile runs. And then uh, uh, and then you know I go to the gym like few times a week and, kinda do my, usual routine. Um, but, yeah, I think the only thing that's really different has, have been, the runs, the longer runs. Um, well, I, what do you mean by that? I'm not sure what, what <UNSURE>that</UNSURE> means. Not, not bad, I mean it just kinda starts hurting, you know. Um. You know I would say probably starts off like after, uh, maybe, twenty minutes or so. Which is, probably I don't know like somewhere around mile, three maybe,  two and a half or three miles. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> switching my kilometres and miles, I'm not sure, <UNSURE>all right</UNSURE>. Yeah, that is a good question. So, um, you know the last few times, the last time I actually stopped, I mean I ran a little bit longer, but then I stopped, because it was um, I, I feel like it's getting worse. Um, and, when I start doing my abs, that's, you know when I do my abs. <UNSURE>It's</UNSURE> kind of requiring me to move my you know, um, to kind of go from the flex position on my knees, and straighten my legs, then I feel all this clicking. And, I think that's also freaked me out, and uh, I just figured you know, something's wrong <UNSURE>here</UNSURE>. So it's more, um, it's actually my right knee that hurts. No. So, ah, you know I, I feel it, it's kind of weird, I feel it in the middle, but I almost feel like maybe it kind of uh,  um, moves to the right, to the right of my knee a little bit. So, yes, well it's, I have, probably some fluid. I googled it, and you know it says that sometimes <UNIN/> fluid accumulates uh, <UNSURE>I</UNSURE>. Sorry? Um, well it did, like, the first time I ran, it was a little bit swollen, but then I just put some like ice on it, and it went away. Um, but, right now, right now it's not swollen, and right now it doesn't hurt, you know. Um, but, it just kind of comes on when uh, um, or you know right now when I flex and extend my leg, it, there's no clicking but, I'll notice it in the gym and then, you know, when I run it'll start hurting. No. No. No, <UNSURE>none</UNSURE>, I don't. Yes. Yes. Well, um, since you're asking. Um, yes I <UNIN/>, I take Ibuprofen, um, and I'll just kinda, use it sometime like uh, um, like sometimes I have some joint issues, but you know, that kind of, is not very frequent. So I'll take Ibuprofen for that. But you know it's nothing like major maybe, like, four hundred milligrams max, something like that. I also sometimes will um, you know, smoke a joint. Um, and, yeah, other than that, that's it. <UNSURE>No</UNSURE>. Uh, well I have sometimes, you know how sometimes like if you stand for a long time, your feet will kinda, or your legs will swell up. Like I noticed it because of my socks, I'll just kind of, notice this indentation. And then, another weird thing. I've felt this just once, but there was this tingling in my toes, like uh, um, after the run. There was tingling in my toes like on my, you know my right toes, um, so. Yes. No. Well I don't know if I really try that, but I, I will tell you that, what I noticed is like if I, you know when my socks come off, I kind of notice that indentation a little bit, I mean it's not like major, right but, I. Uh, I mean do you mean I just need to like press and see what happens, if it like kind of stays or, <UNIN/>. <UNSURE>No</UNSURE>, no, nothing like that, no. No it was just, it was that time, uh, but it was just really weird, because it kind of went on for a while. No. No. Uh, well, I had uh. You know <UNSURE>what</UNSURE> just, kind of your garden variety stuff, right, colds and, uh. I mean I, I do have, I'm far-sighted, and so I had uh, I had Lasik surgery. And then, once I had this really bad UTI, they thought it was kidney stones, and so they had me actually in ER. And if my GP didn't call them, tell them, that you know, they don't need to give me Morphine. Um, that was kind of an awful experience but, uh, other than that, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm pretty good. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Well, I'll take uh, I take vitamin D. Uh, I take melatonin. Sometimes, you know, just for cramps, I'll take, like, uh, um, ibuprofen, or actually <UNIN/>, uh, I'll take, what am I taking? Aleve. Whatever Aleve is. Think that's maybe um, Acetaminophen, or, I can't remember what class of drugs. You know occasionally, if I'm really having hard times, like I'll, I'll sleeping, I'll take Xanax. Um, but, I prefer Melatonin, it's just sometimes Melatonin doesn't work. No, no, no problems. Mm-hmm. <UNSURE>Hmm</UNSURE>. I see. OK. Well, you know I read, I read some stuff online that, that maybe like my ligaments there's, I think it's like ACL or, or something like that right, and so if that. I mean I'm kind of like freaked out that <UNSURE>that</UNSURE> may break. So do you think it's that, or? <UNSURE>Right</UNSURE>. OK. OK. Can you, so are you going to send referral for that? <UNSURE>OK. Great</UNSURE>. Mm-hmm. <UNSURE>That sounds</UNSURE> good. Thank you yeah. <UNIN/>, sure I mean, give me the, stronger medicine, I'll give that a try. <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE>. Sweet. Thanks so <UNSURE>much. OK</UNSURE>.

So, when do you think it started? Okay. And any joint problems before that? Okay, so at the moment, just tell me about the exercise that you're doing normally. And have you had any times when the knee feels like it's giving way underneath you? So it means if you're there and you just feel it sort of jolt, like give way, feel unstable underneath you. And does it hurt? How far into the run does it generally hurt? Okay. Oh, you're fast. And do you have to stop running or can you run through the pain? Okay. Okay. Right. And you said before it's both knees. Any problems with your left one? Okay, can you just describe in the knee or show me whereabouts the pain is happening mainly? Okay. Have you noticed any tenderness when you press over any areas in the knee? Okay, does it look swollen to you? Does the knee look swollen? Okay, and if you're sitting still for a while, do you have any problems when you stand up, any locking up of the knee? Can't straighten it. Any problems going up and downstairs? Any problems just walking normally? And in terms of range of movement, are you able to fully straighten the leg? And what about fully flex it? Okay. Are you taking any medication for the knee? Okay, and any other joint problems that you're getting? Any back pain, small swelling of your hands, feet, elbows, wrists, any pain? Okay. On your right side. Any change in colour or temperature of your lower legs? Any swelling which stays if you push in and then you release it, that it stays there? Yeah, any pain in the back of the calf or anything like that? And with your foot, has that gone back to normal now? Do you feel any altered sensation, tingling, numbness, anything like that? Okay. And any pain in the joints of your foot or on the underside in the arch? Any problems walking around on hard floors? Okay, have you had any other medical problems before?

So on the skin is there any, you know any of the patches, <UNIN/> sore and you mentioned it's quite sore. Is it weeping? Is it like watery liquid coming from that area? Weeping? <UNIN/> Nothing <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. OK. Right. Yeah. So you have cracks over there, OK.

Like, <UNIN/> you know, where it's, the skin's very, um, thick, and darkened areas? OK.  <UNSURE>Uh, righty-ho</UNSURE>. So, you've mentioned you've, got a history of eczema, so what do you do about it? <UNIN/> How do you keep it under control? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> <UNSURE>Dermal</UNSURE>, alright, and have you been using them recently, or not? <UNSURE>You </UNSURE> use them every day? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> OK. Have you ever used steroids in the past, for your eczema? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> You've used steroids before? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Yeah. Also, you're still using the steroids.

That, does that ring a <UNIN/> ? Yeah. So you're using the Hydrocortisone, yeah? Are you using any antihistamines at all? No, no antihistamines. OK. Right, fine. Otherwise, other than those rash, you're feeling well in yourself. There's no temperature, no joint pains, yeah? <UNIN/> No fever? You've tried the antihistamines <UNSURE>and it</UNSURE> didn't work. OK which one did you try? OK, so like <UNSURE>cetirizine</UNSURE>, yeah? Yeah, OK, that's fine. Right. OK, so from what you're describing, It looks like, you know, it is quite widespread, your eczema. Yeah? 'Cause you're having it all over your chest and <UNIN/> hands and things like that. Um. So do you have any <UNIN/> allergies to any medication at all? No allergies, OK. And you don't, other than eczema you don't have <UNIN/> any other medical condition. <UNIN/> Mother has migraine and, what was the other one, I didn't understand. <UNIN/> who who has hypothroidism?

This much is, is enough to cover your palms. And your - back of your hands, yeah?  So it's very small amounts, so that if you can imagine you can cover with a very small amount the whole body. Yeah. So use that. You, you have to use it twice a day, for the next couple of weeks. OK. If, if there's no improvement, you need to get back to us. Or, if you have any kind of adverse reaction, like an allergic reaction, which is unlikely, but if it still happens you need to get in touch with us.

Have you checked your temperature at all?  Have you got a thermometer at home? And any problems with weakness, tingling, numbness in your arms or legs? And what have you been doing since it came on? Have you been able to go to work, or have you been at home? OK. Does it get worse with any position that you're <UNSURE>on</UNSURE>? Is it worse when you lie flat, or when you bend forward? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Any problems if you cough or sneeze? OK. And can you just tell me a bit about, your medical history in the past? Have you had any significant medical problems? Any hospital admissions, operations, <UNSURE>something</UNSURE> like that? Do you take any medication? And which contraception do you take? <UNSURE>When</UNSURE> did you start that one? Do you get any side effects from it? OK. And, anyone in your family had any medical problems? OK. And have you had your blood pressure checked <UNIN/> recently? Have you had it checked, when you've had the <UNIN/>, repeat prescription done? Do you know if there's been any problems with it? OK. Um, and whereabouts, whereabouts do you live at the moment? You've given me your, address. <UNSURE>Do</UNSURE>, who do you live with at home? OK. And do you drink much alcohol day-to-day? OK. And do you smoke? Do you take any other drugs of any sort? Um. So, <UNIN/>, what, what tablets did you say you've been taking already? <UNSURE>Yeah</UNSURE>. What tablets have you been taking already, for it? What happens when you get <UNSURE>a</UNSURE>, when you take Aspirin? OK. And have you ever, taken any, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, like Ibuprofen, Naproxen, anything like that? OK. Um, so, this headache is new to you, and you've, you've not had regular headaches before? What I would, suggest is, taking, uh, um, some anti-inflammatories, along with the Paracetamol. <UNSURE>Um, as a</UNSURE>. Uh, you said you're eating OK? I mean it, from the sounds of it, it does, sound quite like a migraine, but obviously <UNSURE>if you</UNSURE> had no history of that, in the past. Um, and is anything changed recently, or any, anything you've done recently might've, triggered it? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Yeah. Um, well that would be the first thing to do, is to take some anti-inflammatories along with the Paracetamol. Make sure you're really well hydrated. Um, and, see how that goes, and if it, if it isn't settling, or it's getting worse, or you get any other change in your headache. Um, or you're unwell with it, with a high temperature, then we would certainly need to speak to you. Straight away about that. The other thing is if you, if you're getting persistent, um, headaches, or headaches associated with your menstrual cycle, or certain things seem to trigger these headaches. Then, it, it would be worth, having a further discussion about it, to see whether we can, work out if we can help <UNSURE>the</UNSURE>, that longer-term. Um, I would, try and arrange to get your blood pressure checked, if you haven't had it checked for a while. Uh, <UNSURE>and</UNSURE>, thing to do <UNSURE>is</UNSURE> to have a thermometer at home, so you <UNSURE>can</UNSURE> make sure that your temperature's OK. If you have a raised temperature or, your headache's just getting <UNSURE>worse, or</UNSURE> you develop any rashes or anything like that. Then we'd need to speak to you straight away. OK, so, have you got any other questions? OK. OK then, we'll, we'll, we'll, um, speak to you again. <UNIN/>, <UNSURE>very</UNSURE> much. Bye.","<INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Uh, yeah it's uh, <UNIN/>.

So when you say annoying, does it hurt to look, uh, look at bright lights? <UNIN/>, OK. And um, have you had any loss of vision or blurry vision? <UNSURE>Mmm</UNSURE>, <UNIN/>, <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE>. Any nausea or any vomiting? When you say sick, you mean you feel sick? OK. Yeah, no vomiting, OK. Any neck pain or neck stiffness? OK. And any difficulty with speaking or, um, speech? Any difficulty <UNIN/>, with weakness in your arms and legs? Ohh really? OK. OK, <UNSURE>yeah probably</UNSURE>, well I'll, I'll ask you a bit more about your work later on. Um, any recent head injuries at all? OK. And have you had anything like this before in the past? Or, uh, or similar, similar to, similar to this kind of headache, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> not, OK. All right. Um, any temperatures, or fevers? Any rashes at all, on your skin? OK. And just moving forwards. Are you otherwise fit and well, Adriana? You fit and well? <UNIN/>, do you have any other medical <UNSURE>history</UNSURE>? Any history of migraines at all? OK. Um, fine. I'll ask you a bit more about that in just a second. Before I go any further, can I ask, do you take any regular medication? Are you on the pill? OK. Do you have any allergies to any medications? OK. So you mentioned your mother and sister both have migraines. Are they, is that normally well-controlled or are they um, having difficulty, controlling their symptoms? <UNSURE>Mm-hmm, OK</UNSURE>. Ohh right, OK, fine. Um, socially, tell me a bit more about your life, outside of, um, outside of, work. So <UNIN/>, who lives at home with you? <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE>. Excellent. And are you working at the moment? You mentioned this <UNIN/>, impacting on your work. <UNSURE>Mmm</UNSURE>. OK. Do you wear glasses? Have you had any, uh, have you had any recent eye check, done? Eye test? OK, all right. Something for you to bear in mind if you feel that you are, your eyes are straining. Um I would always recommend having a repeat eye test done. Um, have you been feeling more stressed or anxious at work recently? OK, all right. Great. Um, regarding smoking or alcohol. Do you drink or smoke at all? <UNSURE>But</UNSURE> only socially? OK. Right. Now um, Adriana, do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms? Have you, have you read anything online, or spoken to people? Mm-hmm. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Mmm. OK. Is <UNSURE>it</UNSURE> anything in particular you were hoping I could do for you today? <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE>. How many tablets did you take of Ibuprofen? Three a day, OK. All right. Um, so uh, Adriana, so um, really what I think is going on here. I <UNIN/>, uh, unfortunately I do think this could be, a headache very similar to a migraine. Um, the reason I say that is because the history is very suggestive of it, given your mum and your sister also migraines. I think it's something for us to think about. Um, now I'm not saying it's gonna, keep happening, but, it may just be a one-off. But it's certainly worth treating it today stronger <UNSURE>analgesia or</UNSURE> painkillers. Um, now moving forward, we have some options which we can discuss. Uh, you tried the Ibuprofen. Now, my only worry is, I'm not sure whether you're taking, the correct dose. You can take up to two tablets, three times a day. <UNSURE>So</UNSURE>, so <UNIN/>, there's definitely room for, improvement there. Or, I can prescribe you something stronger, like Naproxen, which is another anti-inflammatory, which can be helpful. <UNSURE>Um</UNSURE>, we can also add in other, painkillers like, Paracetamol, or Codeine. Which might be helpful as well. OK. And I think it's <UNIN/>, certainly worth looking into that, so I can give you a <UNIN/>, prescription for that today. Um, with regards to um, the next few days. It may be worth keeping a headache diary so we can try and work out what's, you know, if there's any triggers which could be causing your headaches to become worse. <UNSURE>And</UNSURE>, and, you know I'd like you to come back and see me, in about uh, a week's time, week to two weeks' time. If you are having <UNIN/>, more frequent episodes of these type of headaches. We can think about giving you medications as, prophylactic. Which basically means, medications to stop you from having these headaches on a regular basis. But we can have that discussion next time. OK. In the meantime if your headaches aren't getting any better, or they're getting worse. Um, you know, I want you to give me a call, or come back and see me sooner. OK? So, <UNSURE>if</UNSURE> you're having any problems with your vision, or weakness in your arms and legs, or you're just not feeling very well. Just give me a call, and come back and see me. All right? Great. Well, have a good day. Bye.","<UNIN/>. Hi there. Yes, it's um Adriana Katherine <UNIN/>. And I'm twenty six year old. Well, I have this like really crazy headache that's been going on for a few days. And it really annoys me. Eh, around three days ago, maybe. Um, it's basically like, it kind of feels all over my head, but like mainly, um, around my right eye. Um Um it's, it kind of comes and goes. Um but, I mean it is there all the time, but <UNIN/> like sometimes it's stronger. Ohh it's probably a eight. Um, it's kind of, it's dull but sometimes it gets a bit sharper. So basically it like, it developed gradually, I guess. It's like the first day it just started when I was at work. And by the end of the day it was like pretty, pretty, like it was a lot, basically. And then I was thinking OK, maybe I'll just go to sleep. And when I woke up the next morning like, it was even, even worse basically. So Yeah. Um so I tried uh Ibuprofen. Um so I took, like a few. Um for the last two days, basically. But it doesn't really help, no. In in the past it did help me, which is why I decided to try it. But Um Not really, but just when it started, I I got this like weird shooting lights. And like now like light is quite annoying, my eyes. Yeah, yeah. It hurts. So Not loss of vision, I wouldn't say. It's just like some lights from, shooting lights <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. Um, well I'm like basically, I I'm sick with the headache. But I, no vomiting. Yeah. No. No. No, it's hard to focus though. So, I I had to take a couple of days off work, actually. Uh, no. Yeah I mean, headaches, you mean. Yeah. I mean I had. But, usually after I I take uh Ibuprofen it kind of goes away. So, but this time it's just not. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. No. Mm, no not that I've noticed. Am I what, sorry? Yeah, I think so. It's just the headache. Not myself, I've never had a migraine. But my sister and my mom have them quite frequently. Uh, no no. Mm not that I know of. Yeah. Um so my sister's, like better. Like it's kind of, it's very rare. But my mom's is like quite bad, um usually when there's like a season changing and stuff like that. It's, yeah. Takes her out for a few days, basically. Uh I live with housemates. So, three of them. So we're four <UNIN/>. Yeah so I work, well I work in IT. So I work with computers a lot. So it kind of is difficult to focus. Um I had to like reduce the uh, brightness of my screen. Yes, I do. No, uh I've been wearing them since I was five <UNIN/>, five year old. <UNSURE> So, it's quite a long time.</UNSURE> <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Well, it's been a bit stressful, kicking off a new project. But um, yeah nothing out of the ordinary, really. I socially smoke. And I drink <UNIN/> only socially. Um Not really. Um <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> at first I thought it's stress, or maybe I didn't drink enough water. Because sometimes when I don't drink enough water, I I like get headaches. Um But, I don't think that's it. And I'm like worried, it's, I don't want it to be a migraine. Because I know what it's like, from my mom and my sister. And it's really annoying. So I I really don't want to have that. And I know it's genetic. So I've researched that. Um but I don't know if that is the case. So, yeah. Yeah maybe just kinda, if you have any recommendations of <UNIN/> that I can take something stronger. Because apparently, Ibuprofen doesn't help me. Uh Usually it gets resolved if I have headache in like, after like one or two days. But currently it, it didn't help me. Uh, three a day. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Ohh right. Mm-hmm. Mm, yeah. I think <UNIN/> is what my mom takes for when she has um, um migraines. Mm-hmm. Mm, OK. OK. Yeah. OK. Great. Thank you. You too.

My date of birth is the nineteenth of September, nineteen ninety three. My address is, uh, sixty four, Cliveden Place, in, South Wimbledon. Yes I am, yeah. Um, I've been feeling really anxious over the past few months. Um, I just get really nervous every morning about leaving the house, and it's started to really worry me, and just add up, and build up on that anxiety. And I just didn't know, who to talk to or, so I wanted to check with my GP. Um, I guess so, I think um, I would say maybe about two months or so, I've been feeling like this, and that probably coincides with, me starting a new job, um. Which <UNSURE>I</UNSURE> <UNIN/>, I would say it's quite <UNIN/>, I mean every job is stressful, <UNSURE>and</UNSURE> when you first start, but it's been really stressful I think over the past two months, definitely. Um, so I work for a, a, a fashion retailer, in um, the head office team, and it's just a brand new sector. I've never worked in retail before, my boss is not very nice to me and <UNSURE>I don't</UNSURE>. But I also think that, it's just been, I just really dread, going there. I just hate, speaking to her, I hate like seeing everyone and, really worried about whether I'm doing well or not. And it's really <UNSURE>impacting</UNSURE> on like, on the rest of my life, like my sleep and stuff like that. <UNSURE>Right</UNSURE>. Yeah, <UNSURE>this is</UNSURE> really so, I, I, I've, as I say like, I don't want to go to work in the morning, so I just find no way of, I can't get out of bed. But it's also because, when I leave I just, when I've left work, I just feel so stressed and so worried about everything I've done, I can't get to sleep for hours and hours and hours. So I. About ten, eleven, probably. Not for ages, I'm, I'm lying awake all night <UNSURE>Mmm</UNSURE>. So I find my, my heart kind of racing, and then I'm just like panicking that I'm gonna be late, and that that's gonna make work even more stressful. So I do have an alarm, but I find myself waking up before that, 'cause I'm just my heart is racing. And actually the other day, I was just like, I was lying in bed and I really thought my heart was racing so much, I thought I was gonna have a heart attack in the morning. <UNIN/>, I just, I can't even tell because I feel like I'm, even when I'm in sleep it's such a shallow sleep, but maybe, three, four hours, I'm getting now. Probably, not, <UNSURE>significant</UNSURE> changes maybe. No I wouldn't say that, I wouldn't say that I'm eating like, much differently. <UNSURE>Ohh that</UNSURE>, I probably have more chocolate than normal, just because I feel, so down. Yeah, <UNIN/>. Yeah, So <UNSURE>um</UNSURE>, it's, it's usually kind of like, when I realise in the morning that, either um, I feel like I'm gonna be late, because I've like overslept 'cause I'm so tired. Um, or I wake up in a panic thinking I am gonna be late so, it's just kind of like, just a constant like, rapid heart beating. It's <UNSURE>just</UNSURE> really, really stressful. I don't know if it's, stress or if, <UNIN/>,  or I did think it was like, a heart problem <UNSURE>really</UNSURE> actually. Irregular, I think. Ohh it can be anything, I think <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> couple of minutes, or the other day I was actually just, sort of lying there for like, holding my hand on my chest for like ten <UNSURE>minutes</UNSURE>. Yeah, but I would say this is only in the past. Sort of like, couple of months as I say that I've been, experiencing this. No, um, well yeah it's painful to <UNIN/>, when the heart, when my heart is beating fast but, but, yeah. It's just, really, really low, <UNSURE>I mean I</UNSURE>, I'm finding now that I'm just, I find no enjoyment at all. <UNSURE>It's</UNSURE> kind of day-to-day, <UNSURE>and</UNSURE> anything that <UNSURE>I'm</UNSURE> doing. It's not just my job it's, you know when I leave I'm just so tired that, anything that, previously was, really fun is just not, <UNSURE>it's</UNSURE> not enjoyable. And I'm <UNIN/> like, yeah, on edge the whole time. Well right now <UNSURE>I'm</UNSURE>, I'm working so late, <UNSURE>and</UNSURE> everything is really, really stressful. So I don't really get much time to myself but, when I do wanna go out, or, you know, see friends or just relax. It, it seems quite difficult to do that. I avoid them insomuch that I, feel like I'm. Yeah, so I mean sometimes it just, I know that I'm not gonna have fun, because I don't want to, go out and, do things that I would normally have done. Yeah, as I say like everything that I had previously been doing has been, just difficult to continue with like, I did used to like to like go running, and. And to play tennis and stuff, but now it's just not, I'm just not enjoying it, I'm not, I'm not like, I'm not going out to do that quite so much. No, 'cause I think that would just add to the tension, but I do like pretty much every morning I think, ohh I should call in sick or like, <UNSURE>just</UNSURE> not go. <UNIN/>, um. No I wouldn't say so, I think, I've always managed to make it to work. But I, I wonder if it's building up. So this is why I wanted to call, <UNIN/> I'm <UNSURE>just</UNSURE> worried it's building up to that, and I don't know what to do 'cause I <UNSURE>have</UNSURE>, feel it, felt it, get worse and worse over the past couple of <UNSURE>months</UNSURE>. Yeah I mean, I find public transport really stressful anyway, especially being on the tube it's, 'cause it's quite, getting warmer so it's just really airless. Um, but I think the majority of it, 'cause my life is just so focused around work right now, the majority of it is focused around work as well. Not really I, I'm, no, I would say. I mean everybody always has a bit of tension, a bit of anxiety but, I've never felt, anything this bad before. Yeah. Um, I mean, yeah, yeah, 'cause I do, yeah. I'm pretty much, down like, I don't enjoy, being <UNSURE>and not just</UNSURE> my day at all 'cause. I'm just so worried about everything, um, and I find that even when I'm not, like even at the weekends and stuff it's just the, kind of like constant, feeling of just being a bit, down, a bit unhappy. Um. I don't know, that's a good question, I can't really, I can't really put a <UNIN/> on that at all. I wouldn't, no I wouldn't say that I've had, I haven't had any suicidal thoughts or any, thoughts that have been that extreme like, I haven't. You know I have, I have a good support system, like I do have good family and stuff. So I, I have, I don't have, uh worries about, actually wanting to, um, not go on. It's just that, I don't wanna go on like this. Sorry? Yeah, I live with my parents, just my <UNSURE>parents</UNSURE>. Um, ooh I don't know, probably quite a lot on the Friday or Saturday, just because, that, that's kind of normal, um. <UNSURE>Uh</UNSURE>, maybe I, maybe I do have like a bit during the week. Like, my parents obviously are retired, so they just drink whenever they want, so, whenever they're having a glass of wine, they'll offer it to me and it's like. I guess I don't really keep track of it that much. Probably like, probably quite a lot on a Friday or Saturday, because it's usually going out, so maybe like. I probably go over my limit just on those <UNSURE>days</UNSURE>, anyway, and then like, maybe a glass of wine during the week <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. Um, I try not to smoke, but I do, occasionally, but I don't take drugs. I, well I talk to my mum, because she also suffers from, well she's <UNIN/>, suffered from like depression in the past. I didn't think that it was, that I was suffering from, actual depression because it just seems to be, manifesting as, as total <UNIN/>, as just stress the whole time. But um, I did talk to my mum about it but I haven't sought any, she recommended that I come to the GP, um, but I haven't sought any other. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Yeah I think, yeah I think so. I've never done that before, but yeah. OK. Yeah. Uh-huh. OK. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. OK. That's great, I look forward to reading it. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> OK, OK. Yeah, <UNIN/>. OK, I'll call them up.

that I wouldn't say I'm eating like much differently although I probably have more chocolate than normal just because I feel so down yeah so yeah so I'm it's it's usually kind of like when I realize in the morning that either I'm I feel like I'm going to be late because I've like overslept because I'm so tired or I wake up in a panic thinking I'm going to be late so it's just kind of like just a constant like rapid heartbeating it's really really stressful but I don't know if it's stress or I did think it was like a heart problem initially irregular I think oh it can be anything I think a couple of minutes or the other day I was actually just sort of lying there for like holding my hand on my chest for like 10 minutes yeah I would say this is only in the past sort of like couple of months as I say that I've been experiencing this well yeah it's painful to when the heart when my heart is beating fast but but yeah it's just really really low I'm I'm finding now that I'm just I find no enjoyment at all kind of day to day in anything that I'm doing it's not just my job it's you know when I leave I'm just so tired that anything that previously was really fun is just not enjoyable and I'm like yeah on edge the whole time well right now I'm working so late because everything is really very stressful so I don't really get much time for myself but when I do want to go out or you know be friends or just relax it it seems quite difficult to do that I avoid them in so much that I feel like I'm yeah so I mean sometimes it just I know that I'm not going to have fun because I don't want to go out and do things that I would normally have done yeah as I say like everything that I had previously been doing has been just difficult to continue with like I did used to like to like go running and to play tennis and stuff but now it's just not I'm just not enjoying it and not I'm not like I'm not going out to do that quite so much no because I think that would just add to the tension but I do pretty much every morning I think oh I should call in sick or like it's not go um no I wouldn't say so I think I've always managed to make it to work but I wonder if it's building up so this is why I want to cox and I'm worried it's building up to that I don't know what to do because I've felt it get worse and worse over the past couple of months yeah I mean I find public transport really stressful in a way especially being on the tube it's because it's quite getting warmer so it's just really airless but I think the majority of it because my life is just so focused around work right now the majority of it is focal strong work as well not really I'm no I would say I mean everybody always has a bit of tension a bit of anxiety but I've never felt anything that's bad before yeah um I mean yeah yeah because I do yeah I'm pretty much down like I don't enjoy being this my day at all because I'm just so worried about everything and I find that even when I'm not like even at the weekends and stuff it's just the kind of like constant feeling of just being a bit down a bit unhappy I don't know if that's a good question I can't really I can't really put a take on that at all I wouldn't know I wouldn't say that I've had I haven't had any suicidal thoughts or any thoughts that have been that extreme like I don't you know I have I have a good support system like I do have a good family and stuff so I have I don't have worries about actually wanting to not go on it's just that I don't want to go on like this sorry yeah I live with my parents just my parents um I don't know probably quite a lot on the Friday or Saturday just because that's kind of normal maybe I do have like a bit during the week my parents obviously are retired so they just drink whenever they want so whenever they're having a glass of wine they'll offer it to me and it's like I guess I don't really keep track of it that much probably like probably quite a lot on Friday or Saturday because it's usually going out so maybe like I probably go over my limit just on those days anyway and then like maybe a glass of wine during the week with dinner um I try not to smoke but I do occasionally but I don't take drugs I talked to my mum because she also suffers from or she's suffered from like depression in the past I didn't think that it was that I was suffering from actual depression because it just seems to be manifesting as to as just stress the whole time but I did talk to my mum I said I haven't sought any she recommended that I come to the GP but I haven't sought any other professional yeah I think so I've never done it before but yeah okay that's great I look forward to reading it okay okay yeah okay I'll call them up thank you so much have a good day bye",hi there i'm dr smith from babylon hi there can you just confirm your name date of birth and what time you got to sleep okay and what about your mood day to day i mean can you see that you're quite distressed by it but do you ever get really down about this okay and what about your mood ever been so low that you felt like you couldn't cope with work or you can't just do your normal things day to day then it's important for you to give us a call back and just discuss that further i mean some people with anxiety they do need to take medication to control that but that's not something that we would suggest in the first instance and i'll put some more information on your notes about helping with your sleep patterns and things like that um in terms of the palpitations it is most likely to be associated with anxiety but it's probably worth having a couple of basic blood tests just to make sure that there,

Hello there, it's Dr. Seed here. How can I help you this afternoon? I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a bit more about the headache? Okay. Well, let's try our best. Let's try and get you. Let's try and get you well soon. You mentioned this on your left-hand side, is that right? And it started at midday a few hours ago. Okay. Did a pain come on quite suddenly or was it more of a gradual buildup? Okay. And are you able to describe what kind of headache it was? For example, was this throbbing or was it more of a sharp pain? And is it moving anywhere else at all? Okay. That means you move your neck. Okay. Okay. Is that what you're worried about? Is that what your main worry is today? Oh dear. I'm sorry to hear that. I can understand why it's affecting you. But why don't we take a good history first and let me examine you and then we can have a little chat afterwards and see what's going on here. So you mentioned a few things. You mentioned the headaches. You also mentioned some zigzag lines before the headaches came on. And your vision has been blurry as well. Is that right? Is that on both eyes or just a left eye? Both eyes. Okay. Have you had any difficulty with seeing bright lights at all? Oh, I see. Okay. And you mentioned that you felt quite nauseous. Have you vomited at all? Try, okay. This earlier today. Okay. Any temperatures or fevers? Okay. Any other funny skin rashes that you may have noticed? Okay. Fine. And do you normally get headaches? Okay. And what happened then? How long did it last for? Did you do anything that made it better? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, sure. And I can see your concerns. Obviously, there's a lot, there's a lot of worry there. But, you know, let's take a step by step and see exactly what the causes these headaches are first. I'm just going to ask you some very yes-no questions. That's okay, ma'am. Have you noticed any problems with your speech at all? Any difficulty with your words? Any problems with your arms and legs, for example, numbness or weakness? Any difficulty with your balance or coordination? Okay. And have you had any injuries to your head? Have you had a fall recently or been knocked on the head? Okay, all right. And you're feeling otherwise okay. So, for example, your breathing is okay, you're not feeling breathless or no, okay. Do you have any other medical history I should be aware of? No. So, for example, have you had anyone told you you've had migraines in the past? No, okay. Do you okay? Mariah, so my next question was about family history. Is there anything in the family? So, apart from migraines, is there anything else, anything related to the brain, for example? What was that, sorry? Under thyroid as well. Okay. Okay, any other problems, for example, the brain or you mentioned brain cancer. Any other family history of that? No. Okay. In terms of medications, do you take anything on a regular basis? Okay, and how long have you been on that for? Three months, okay. And is that mainly for contraception or is that for something else? Okay, all right. That's something we may need to have a little discussion about today as well. Well, my next question was about your social, really, your situation at home. You mentioned you work in a fashion industry. Is your job quite stressful at the moment? Is it going you down? Okay, all right. And what kind of things do you do to alleviate your stress normally? Okay, do you do much in the way of exercise? Okay. Who's at home with you? Okay. Are you coping okay at the moment? Yeah. Okay. Do you smoke at all? Yes. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol? Okay. All right. So normally at least I'd like to kind of proceed to examination. But based on your story, I wonder whether you may have a migraine, migraine-type headache. It sounds very classical of that nature. The headache on one side, throbbing nature, the nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to bright lights. I'm reassured that you don't have anything more serious such as meningitis or indeed brain cancer. I know that was a big worry of yours initially. Yeah. Well, I hope that puts your ear mind at ease. Certainly, this is the second migraine you've had in the space of a month. So I think moving forwards, there's a couple of options. I think keeping a headache diary would be quite important to see exactly what's triggering these headaches. But we should also try and treat your headaches today. So some strong painkillers would be advisable. So you know, think about paracetamol or even cocodamol and some anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen and naproxen. How's that sound to you? And if your headaches were to become more persistent, then we can maybe think about giving you some medications that will stop your headaches from happening in the first place. Something, you know, prophylactic medicines. Then we can have a discussion next time. I see you next week, perhaps. Okay. Now, a couple of things I want you to think about is, you know, if your symptoms aren't getting better in the next two, three days, or indeed they're getting worse, I'd like you to come back and see me straight away if possible. So if your headache's getting worse and not responding to medications or your neck pain is getting worse or you're developing any weakness in your arms and legs or your vision, then I want you to come back and see me straight away. Okay. Does that sound all okay? Great. Any questions for me? Okay. Have a good day.","Hello. Oh, I've just got a terrible headache since midday. On the left side, it's just making me feel so ill. I just feel like I need to vomit. Well, you know, I noticed some zigzag lines in my vision a few minutes before the headache started. My vision blurred. You know, it just I, yeah, pain's just horrible. It's just making me feel so unwell. And I just want you to do something. Yeah. I don't know, really, it just happened. Yeah, I guess it's, yeah, I guess it's throbbing on that left side. No, but it's worse when I move. Well, like, if I lean forward or like move my head or neck, yeah, the headache gets worse. I'm just really worried. Like, I've just been googling, and like, I've read that, you know, if your headache gets worse when you move, it could be a sign of brain cancer. Oh, yeah, yeah. And I've like, you know, my friend's mum, she recently died of a brain tumour, so it's really concerning me, actually. Okay. It feels like it's on both. Yeah, well, I'm wearing wearing sunglasses right now. It's just, you know, lights really hurting my eyes. Yeah, I vomited twice. No, I don't feel feverish. No, I haven't noticed anything like that. Not really prone to them, no, no, but I did. I did have a similar headache a few weeks ago. Just similar. A couple of days. Yeah, I had to take painkillers and had to sort of go to bed and rest. And a couple of days off work and work in the fashion industry and wondering what's going on, like has to take sick days. I need to get back to work today, but what if it is a brain tumour? What's going to happen with my future, my career? You know, yeah, I'm really worried about this. Never had headaches like this before. Like, why should I get now? No. No. No. No. No, nothing. No. My mum has migraines, but I've not been diagnosed. I would as well. My mum has an underactive thyroid as well. No. I take the pill microgynon at three months. It's for contraception. Yeah, it's really stressful actually. Just having problems with like people at work, you know, managers like putting a lot of pressure on me to deliver. And oh, yeah, it's not a good time. I don't feel down, just feel a bit stressed. Nothing really. No. I live on my own. Fine. No. No. Thank you, Alice. Thanks so much. I was so worried that I had cancer and oh, now you say migraine. Yeah, I guess my mum had similar symptoms to me. And yeah, it does make sense. Okay, that sounds good. Okay. Okay. Okay. Doctor, that's great. No, thank you. Okay, thanks.

So, um, they, they can come, they can make you, your mood change, can be slightly low or <UNIN/> too, slightly high. Can give you, a high blood sugar, um, and, uh, <UNSURE>their</UNSURE>. Uh, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, they can also cause rash, nausea, um, headaches, but, mostly is well-tolerated, and it should help your asthma an awful lot. Um, uh, what I'd like to do is, is send you these, the, some prescriptions for your, uh, inhalers, <UNIN/>, ongoing. So you, um, you can, once you get better from this asthma attack, you can, you can, use the Clenil Modulite in the morning, with Ventolin as a PRN. <UNIN/>, so, a Ventolin when you need to, um, when you're getting <UNSURE>wheezy</UNSURE>. If you should start to use the Ventolin more than, uh, every three hours. Uh, at, at anytime, it's a good idea to seek medical attention. So, um, see a doctor, um, in some capacity. Uh, and, the other thing I'd like to send you is a spacer, which would allow the medication to actually, go into your lungs better. Have you, do you know what a spacer is? Have you used one before? Have you got one? OK. All right. Well, um, I'll send you another one, and it has some instructions about how to use it, but essentially, uh, couple of puffs to prime it, inside, breathing in and out, um, uh, for five or <UNIN/>, five or ten breaths. Uh, yeah. So. Uh, was there anything else that was on your mind? Or you're concerned about at this stage? OK, and, and uh, I might give you some time off work as well. You can self-certify first seven days, but uh, I think I would advise you just to, rest a little bit until you're feeling a bit better, if you're OK with that. All right? <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE>. No worries. Any deterioration <UNSURE>in</UNSURE> your symptoms, like worsening shortness of breath. Um, or just generally concerning symptoms, uh, pain in your chest tightness, uh, feeling light-headed. Uh, then, seek further medical attention anytime please. OK? OK. Thank you. Bye bye.","Hello. Hi. Yeah, sure. <UNSURE>My name's</UNSURE> Daniel <UNIN/>. Yeah. May <UNIN/>. Nineteen ninety two. Yeah. Totally. Um, yeah, I just, my chest has been feeling really tight. Uh, for about. Three hours now. Twenty six, yeah. Yeah, like a little bit, um. Yeah, a little bit short of breath, not too bad. Yeah, I'm feeling a bit wheezy, as well. <UNSURE>Kind of</UNSURE> cough <UNIN/>, coughing, yeah. <UNSURE>Yeah</UNSURE>. You know I had a cold last week, and, it's not as bad as it was, but yeah, I had a sore throat, I had a runny nose. Uh, just feeling under the weather. I mean I feel worse, but the runny nose isn't as bad any more. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. Yeah, but the cough's kind of stuck around. Uh, no. Yeah, yeah, I have asthma, I've had it for a while now, um. And then I have like, a hayfever, you know, and some allergies <UNSURE>just</UNSURE> to dust, <UNSURE>stuff like that</UNSURE>. Um, yeah, so, uh, you know the um, uh, Ventolin. It's called uh, Salbutamol. I got that one, and then I have a steroid, a Clenil, Clenil inhaler. <UNSURE>Yeah</UNSURE>, yeah. Um, well to be honest, I was away at uni last week, and I forgot to bring it with me, so I haven't really in the past week. <UNSURE>Uh</UNSURE>. Because <UNIN/>, because um, sorry, they ran out and I, I forgot to, go and grab the next one. About a week ago. Yeah. Not with me right now, no, I ran out. No, no, not allergic to anything. Just like, just the, dust and stuff, but nothing, no drugs. Um, yeah, my mum has eczema, and my dad has asthma. <UNIN/>, ohh, when I was young, I also had eczema. And I had a milk protein allergy, when I was young too. Um. Not really, like I feel like asthma's probably a part of it, and, probably getting my, inhalers would be helpful Um. <UNSURE>It's just</UNSURE> kinda scary, 'cause I haven't had, a time like this where I've been so, tight, uh, in a long time. I mean, it gets a little bit worse at night but, basically, just pretty consistent, and it hasn't gone away. No, not really pain, it's more like, tight. It just feels like sometimes, <UNIN/> I can't get a full breath in, you know. Not in a long time. When I was young, a little bit, more like, back in high school. Um, but, I've been pretty good at taking my <UNIN/>, my inhalers, so, not, not so much any more. Yeah, when I was in high school, I had to have a tube put down my throat. Yeah I did, yeah. Yeah, I'm <UNSURE>doing</UNSURE> pretty good, I'm doing pretty good, just on the Clenil, and the Salbutamol. Uh, I think I was like seventeen. Sixteen maybe. <UNSURE>No</UNSURE>, no. Uh, I'm definitely not short of breath at rest, like, except for that feeling I was describing. It does when I'm walking up stairs, I do feel like, I have a little bit, more short of breath than I would normally be. No, no, no I'm not. Well I just wanna know that I'm OK, to just like keep. I just don't wanna have to get, um, that, that intubation again. Uh, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. OK. Sorry, sorry, you were cutting in and out a little bit there. What were you saying? Um, I can't remember, probably. <UNSURE>I think so</UNSURE>. OK. OK. <UNSURE>Yeah</UNSURE>. Yeah, yeah, I, somebody told me how to use one a while ago. I don't, I don't really use it, to be honest, but. I think I do, I have one somewhere. OK. <UNIN/>, I think you got me covered. OK, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. All righty. Well, thank you very much. All right, sounds good. <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE>, thank you.

Hi, how are you doing? My name's Joe. I'm one of the doctors here at Babylon. Can I just confirm your name, please? Hi, Daniel. And your date of birth? 92. Okay, Daniel. And are you in a comfortable and confidential place to talk? Happy to go ahead. Great. How can I help? Okay. And how long has this been going for, Daniel? Okay. And so tight chest for three hours. And so you're born in 92, so it makes you 26. And you're any shortness of breath at all with that? Any cough, wheeze? Slight cough, yeah. Sore throat, runny nose, sore ears? You're feeling better now other than the tight chest? Right. Okay, okay, but you know, now you've got this, this, so you've still got, still got symptoms of a cold, essentially. Yeah, okay. And are you coughing up anything? And do you have any other medical problems like asthma? Okay. Do you have any inhalers or any medications? Yeah. Venol modulate, yeah, okay. And have you been using clinol and the ventilin, and how often have you been using them? Both of them. Yeah, sure. Okay. All right. All right. So you haven't got any clinol or any ventilin at the moment? Okay. All right. Any drug allergies that you know of? Okay, great. Now, do you, anyone in your family had any medical problems that you know of? Okay. Right. So just do you have any other sort of concerns or ideas about what might be going on or hopes for this consultation? Yeah, absolutely. I can imagine. Well, it certainly sounds like you've had this cold, you've got wheezy with a cough and it's non-productive cough and you're short of breath. Is the cough worse at night time? Yeah. Okay. And you've got this tight chest. But even though you've got chest pain, there's more of a tight chest, isn't it? Yeah, sure. Okay, well, I would quite like to certainly get you some ventilin, clinol modulate. Have you had asthma exacerbations in the past? Yeah. Have you ever been to hospital as an inpatient, as in stayed in there overnight for asthma? Oh, okay. So you went to hospital and had a... So you stayed in hospital for a few days, did you, with an asthma exacerbation? Okay, but currently you're just on ventilin and clinol and you haven't got any of those inhalers at the moment. Okay. Sorry, how old were you when you had that severe asthma exercisation? Sure. Okay. Just to quantify how short of breath you are, I don't suppose you've got a peak flow with you. No, you won't have, will you? Are you able to walk up a flight of stairs okay, walk on the flat okay, without getting too short of breath? Or are you short of breath of rest? Sure. Yeah, okay, but you're not sure of breath at rest at the moment. Okay, fine. So what I think, and just to go over, is there anything you had hoped about getting other than a prescription for your inhalers? Was there anything else that you'd hoped about getting from this? Sure, yeah. Absolutely. Well, I'm really glad you all talked to me today. I think what we can do is give you a prescription for some more of the inhalers. We can get that to you within the hour, I would hope. And I think the other thing I'd like to do is just give you a dose of steroids. So these are tablets which you can take for five days, two tablets in the morning, and that should just dampen down your asthmatic response. Okay. Now there are some side effects to the steroids, which I should really tell you about, but please read the label that's associated with. Don't be too worried about the side effects. Most of the time the steroids are very well tolerated. And you probably, have you had them in the past, do you know of? Have you had steroids in the past? Probably. Yeah, I really do. So they can come, they can make you, your mood change can be slightly low or slightly high, can give you a high blood sugar and they can also cause rash nausea, headaches, but mostly it's well tolerated and it should help you out an awful lot. What I'd like to do is send you these, some prescriptions for your inhalers are ongoing. So you can, once you get better from this asthma attack, you can use the clinol modulate in the morning with ventilin as a PRN, so a ventilin when you need to, when you're getting busy. If you should start to use the ventilin more than every three hours at any time, it's a good idea to seek medical attention. So see a doctor in some capacity. And the other thing I'd like to send you is a spacer, which would allow the medication to actually go into your lungs better. Do you know what a spacer is? Have you used one before? Have you got one? Okay. All right. Well, I'll send you another one and it has some instructions about how to use it, but essentially a couple of puffs to prime it inside, breathing in and out for five or ten breaths. Yeah. So was there anything else that was on your mind or you're concerned about at this stage? Okay. And I might give you some time off work as well. You can self-certify for seven days, but I think I would advise you just to rest a little bit until you're feeling a bit better, if you're okay with that. All right. No worries. Any deterioration in your symptoms, like worsening shortness of breath or just generally concerning symptoms, pain in your chest, tightness, feeling light-headed, then seek further medical attention anytime, please. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye.","Hello. Hi. Yeah, sure. Daniel Rat. Yeah, May 1192. Yeah, totally. Yeah, I just, my chest has been feeling really tight for about three hours now. 26, yeah.

Yeah, when I was in high school, I had to have a tube put down my throat. Yeah, I did, yeah. I'd be pretty good, I'd be pretty good just on the clenl and the salbutamol. I think I was like 17, 16, maybe I'm definitely not short of breath at rest, like except for that feeling I was describing. It does when I'm walking upstairs, I do feel like I have a little bit more short of breath than I would normally be. No, no, no, I'm not. Well, I just want to know that I'm okay to just like keep, I just don't want to have to get that intubation again. Okay, sorry, sorry, you were cutting in and out a little bit there. What were you saying? Um, I can't remember, probably. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah, I somebody taught me how to use it on a while ago. I don't, I don't really use it, to be honest, but I think I do. I have one somewhere. Okay. I think you got me covered. All righty. Well, thank you very much. All right, sounds good. Okay, thank you.

Um, I've got, got a bit of a temperature, I think. I haven't measured it but um, think I've, yeah, I think I've got a fever. Um, so um, headache started uh, first. Um, and then sort of yeah, fever sort of came along a bit afterwards. Um, so I've had some Paracetamol and some Ibuprofen, but it's not really helping at the moment. Yep. Um no, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> like um it, it's fine, light doesn't seem to bother me too much. And I've got some general aching muscles. Um, not necessarily sort of in my neck. It's kind of a bit all over, really. No, no I haven't, I haven't been sick. Uh no, no cough. Uh, no. No. Um, no it's, it seems to be OK. It, it's fine. Uh, no. Um just, I, I suppose general aching, body aching. Uh, no. I'm, I'm sort of, yeah, <UNIN/> seem to be sort of fine with that sort of stuff but, yeah. Uh no, um general medical history is fine. Uh, no. Um, I, I suppose uh I have been away to um, uh, Thailand.  Um, uh <UNIN/> week or so ago. Um had some, like, <UNIN/> usual mosquito bites from sort of traveling around and <UNIN/> a friend of mine has also been a bit unwell, but um, uh, yeah, that 's the only sort of, like, history per se. Um, I um, uh, I I do feel cold quite a lot. Uh, you know it's, um, I no sort of shivering, but definitely like a bit cold. Yep. Uh, no. Uh, no. Um OK. OK. Uh <UNIN/> no. I mean I've got a bit of a rash, but nothing like, uh no, no, no, no bleeding. Um, it's uh, the rash is kind of <UNIN/> all over my body. Like it's not, it's not, it's not really localised. Um uh sort of red and itchy. Yeah. Uh, yes. <UNIN/> OK. OK. OK. OK. Uh, no. <UNSURE>Sounds </UNSURE> serious. OK. OK, cool.

Hi. So, just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your name for me, please? Okay, and your date of birth and your address for me, please. That's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. Okay, so I understand you're having a headache. Is that correct? Okay, right. And so, what started first? Was it the headache or the fever? Okay, afterwards. Right. And what have you taken so far for your headache? Okay, so just a few more questions with regards to your headache. So, do you find it difficult to look at the light? Okay, and is it any pain when you try to move your neck from side to side up and down? Is there any pain? Okay, all over. Right, and have you been sick with this headache? Okay, and do you have a cough? Okay, so there's no cough or cold, yeah. Okay, and you your ears are okay, there's no earaches. Okay, all right. And with this headache, have you experienced any pins and needles in your face, arms, and legs? No, pins and needles. Any muscle weaknesses at all? Not many weakness, but where you couldn't, you know, hold a cup or anything like that. That's what I mean. Okay, and just a few more questions. Do you, because I don't have any of your background history, do you suffer from any medical conditions? Fine, and no surgical history, that no medical or surgical complaints, yeah, right. And do you have any kind of shivering at all? Do you shivering with the fever? Hot and cold, yeah? Okay, right. And are you using, you've mentioned about the paracetamol amogriffin now, but are you on any regular, any medication, anything that you're using at all? Okay, um, any allergies at all? All right, okay, and okay, so I believe that it is quite important for us to actually examine you. Yeah, it's not possible for us to do that online. I think you would need to come into one of our hubs to have a proper examination, and I think you would need one quite urgently. Okay, so the things that's running in the back of my mind are kind of viral illnesses that one can get with sort of mosquito bites or foreign travel, like malaria. The other common thing around Thailand will be like some dengue, but that would have like you would have some blood spots or bleeding or something, which you don't have at the moment, do you? Okay, so where's the rash? How would you describe? How would you describe the rash and itchy? Okay, so if you want to put a glass on top of the rash, does that rash go away? It goes away. Okay. Okay, so what we need to do is we need to urgently examine you, and that's sometime today. Okay, and after our examination, there is a high possibility that sometimes we might need to send you to hospital, but I'm not sure as yet. So I'd like you to be seen in one of our hubs as soon as possible. So I'll write night notes in and recommend that you would need to be urgently seen by the doctor, preferably in the next few hours' time. Okay, and in any case, if that's not available, I'd like you to take yourself to AE. All right, any questions at all? It's, you know, obviously, when I've spoken to you, you didn't tick the box for many series, but you're in the middle somewhere, let's put it that way. If you, you know, things like we have to rule out is meningitis and all, but then you just have a general muscle ache. You didn't say that you had things like you had problems looking at the light or something. So those are things when we think of meningitis. But and then it's the in meningitis, you get a non-blanching rash. While in any kind of virus, it means that the rash usually goes away. Saying that, we don't know whether these are the beginning stages. So that's why I rather, but I would rather you see a GP as soon as possible if we've got a slot available. But if not, I think you need to be seen and maybe have some blood tests and examinations. Okay. All right. You take care then. Bye now. Cheers. Bye.","Hi.

Can you hear me OK? That's perfect. Um <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> this audio. And then it's absolutely fine. Uh, now before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age? Twenty seven, OK. And how can I help you this afternoon, Dan? Wow, no. Sorry to hear. Seems like there's a lot going on there. Well, when did it all start, your symptoms? OK. And <UNSURE>is it</UNSURE> mainly diarrhoea? So, you mentioned watery stools. Um How many times are you going a day, would you say? Alright, wow. OK. So you're losing a lot of, a lot of, you're using a lot of fluid there. OK. Have you got any blood in your stools? <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE>. And any, any tummy pain? Any, any, any pain in your tummy? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Where is this crampy pain? Which part of your tummy? <UNIN/>. Well why don't we start with, is it, is it in the middle, or is it to one particular side? OK. And does the pain come and go, or is it there constantly? <UNIN/>. Fine, OK. And if I was to ask you on a scale of one to ten, ten being the worst pain you ever had, how bad is this pain? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Is it, is this pain as in making you double over? Is it ten, is it ten out of ten, the worst pain you ever had? Or is it more of a kind of a mild pain, like a three out of ten? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> solid six. OK, OK. Alright, good. Um, and apart from the pain and diarrhea, any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting? <UNSURE>Not sleeping</UNSURE>. OK, alright. Uh And the vomiting is not as pronounced as the diarrhea. Is that right? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> and the vomiting is not as, uh, prominent as the diarrhea. Is that right? OK. OK, alright. Um, any other symptoms, like fevers or temperatures? OK. OK, so you're feeling hoarse. OK. And in terms of your waterworks, are you passing urine OK? OK, alright. Um, fine. And, and you said that, you mentioned, three days ago was when it all kicked off. Are you aware of any triggers? I mean, have you for example gone out, had some takeaway food? Have you been around anyone else, um with diarrhea, for example? Is your, is your brother now better? OK, alright. Are you having anything to eat or drink? Have you, I can see you're drinking a coffee, but are you keeping it down? Are you keeping your fluids down? OK, alright. Fine. When was the last time you had anything solid to eat? And which <UNIN/>, which uh which you kept in? OK, alright. Um and and Dan, moving forwards, are you otherwise fit and well, or do you have any other medical history? Good. I'll take it you don't take any regular medications, then. OK. And do you have any allergies to any medications? OK. And what about any family history? Do you have any family history of bowel problems? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Yeah, yeah. So what I mean by bowel is the whole gut. So it could be anything from the <UNIN/> mouth anus. Ohh dear. I'm very sorry to hear that. How is he? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Yeah, OK. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Yeah I'll make a not of that 'cause uh, <UNIN/> important to know these kind of details. Um, and socially, tell me more about your home situation. Who's at home with you, Dan? OK. And, uh, how are things at home? Don't <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. <UNIN/> in general day-to-day life are you managing OK? Any particular <UNIN/>? Sure. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> you mentioned work. You mentioned work. What is it you do for work? <UNIN/>, OK. So <UNIN/>, OK right. And just a couple last final couple, uh couple <UNIN/> questions. Uh, smoking and alcohol, do you do either? Do you smoke, or do you drink much in the way of alcohol? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> And alcohol? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> But not <UNIN/>. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Well thank you for <UNIN/> me. That's really helpful to know. So um, Dan, just as a a conclusion, uh um, just to wrap it all up, I think your symptoms are suggestive of something called gastroenteritis. bit of a basic infection of your tummy. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. There's nothing to worry about. Uh um uh uh I suspect this will just settle down in the next few days. Just like you did for you brother. Drink, make sure you drink plenty of fluids, OK? And you can <UNIN/> <UNSURE>Right</UNSURE>. <UNIN/> fluid is probably best. But I am obviously worried about the fact that you are losing minerals and vitamins. Um so, you can get things like Diarolyte, which is um, a fluid replacement you can get from the pharmacy. It's probably worth <UNIN/> uh recommending that. <UNIN/> no, you can just get that over the counter. Um, you can try just you know regular Paracetamol if you are feeling feverish. But if your symptoms aren't settling down in the next couple of days, so forty eight hours, I want you to give me a call back. Because um, you know if you are getting dehydrated then we need to do further investigations, OK? But I think let's, let's see how you are in the next one to two days. And uh, we'll catch up soon, OK? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> clear fluids. You can use soft diet, things like soup, mash. And then gradually build up, um as much as your body can tolerate. Um, but let's try and keep yourself well-hydrated first, OK? Absolutely. If you are having, if you've got a bit of tummy pain, if you're feeling feverish, then I think Paracetamol is very sensible. OK? Try and <UNIN/> avoid alcohol if you can. OK. Alright then. Thank you for your help. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. Thank you. Bye bye now.","Hello? Hello. Uh I can hear you, but I can't really see you. Is, is that OK? Am I meant to Just <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> connection on the screen. OK. Um so, um my name is uh Dan Choudhry. I am seven, twenty seven. Um so I've just um, been having some troubles, basically in the <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> uh, I guess it's been a little while now. And I've just been feeling not so great. And It's all come from like, uh it's like basically I think it's diarrhoea. And it's like just coming out, like loads of it. Like I go to the toilet and it's just super watery and it Yeah it doesn't feel very solid. It so, it just, it's just pouring straight from my bum, and like just coming out. And it's, uh, Yeah it's just uh not, not been very pleasant. And like I just, it just kind of hasn't, doesn't feel like it's getting better. So Um, so I think it was a few, when I think about it So Monday, Tuesday, I I, so I think it was about three, it's been about three days now. Um so I <UNIN/>, I feel like it's like almost every hour, when I'm awake. Um, <UNSURE>so </UNSURE> <UNIN/>. Sorry? Yeah, so I mean I'm <UNIN/>, I'm trying to drink a lot of water. But um, yeah it's just quite a lot and Uh it's, yeah I I, I think I <UNIN/> I feel like it's just, just fluids coming out. Um So I, no I don't, I don't remember anything, like, no I <UNIN/>, I think it's just I, nothing like that. There's nothing like that. Yeah. I mean I, it, I feel, I feel a <UNSURE>cramp</UNSURE>. <UNIN/> and then, and then I know it's time to go right? So, <UNIN/>around every hour I just feel something come up. And then I have to go. So, yeah I mean that's, that's the <UNIN/>, kind of the first sign. It's kind of, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. If I think about it, it's like, it's like at the bottom. Uh, I don't know if that makes sense. Um Um I I think it it <UNIN/>, it feels pretty <UNIN/>, like in the middle, to me. Not on any side, left or right. Um, it it comes and goes. It comes and goes. OK so like Um <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> So What do you mean by, uh pain? So I, I think it's maybe a I I guess so. I'm, when I think about it, like when I get it, I can pretend that I don't feel it. So I can still sit down and Uh I can still like cover it up, and people don't really notice. So I, I don't know what that means. But maybe is that like a six, or a seven? <UNIN/> <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE>. Um, yeah I definitely, I definitely feel kind of nauseous. Um Like I and, like I've have vomited. And when I like, I think it's maybe something to do with like, whenever I have like milk or something like that, I just feel like I want to vomit. And actually, <UNIN/> yeah one time I just like had some milk, and I just completely vomited it. <UNSURE>Um, I've been</UNSURE>, I've been trying to avoid it. But um, yeah. Um, sorry could you repeat that? Uh no, no it's not. Um so I, yeah I think I am pretty, I feel kind of really hot all the time. And uh I'm pretty sure I'm burning up. I haven't actually done any temperature reading, or anything like that. But it's, I, yeah I've, I've sure I'm, I'm not a, like not a normal temperature. Um yeah a bit, I guess less frequently maybe. Um but yeah, it seems to be OK. Um so I <UNIN/>, so my um my brother has had, actually had something like this for um <UNIN/> he has it as well for five days, as well. Um and I I've, I'm not, yeah I <UNIN/> I can't think of what, what the trigger is for me. I mean, my brother normally can deal, deals with this stuff a lot better than me. But <UNIN/>, yeah I, that's why Um He, so he's been like this for five days. I think he's getting better, but I'm not, I'm not really sure. He said, he said he had, he's had something for a little while as well. Um so it just feels like the, the fluids do go down. But it just feels like it's going straight through. It just feels like it's going straight through. Um so, I had some, I mean I had some lunch today. Um But again it just it <UNIN/> just came, come out pretty loose. Um, so I um, yeah I think, I think otherwise I'm fit and well. I um Yeah I mean I, I'm an OK weight. And um, I I can't think of any related medical history. Um, I mean like my, yeah I <UNIN/> no I <UNIN/> I don't think so. So I Um No I mean I, I've been taking some like Paracetamols and stuff like that lately. But uh, I haven't been, I'm not on any regular medication or anything like that. Um, so I don't have any allergies that I know of. Um bowel, so would, would bowel like, is is the colon like something that <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> So my, yeah my, my dad actually has um colon cancer at the moment. So um, from what I heard he's kind of, So I don't I don't speak to him that often. So I don't, I don't know the exact details. And I, I don't exactly know the full things of like the steps of cancer, and all that kind of thing. But um, he's sort of in his third stage. Uh, I'm not sure what that means exactly. Um, and yeah. So yeah it's, it's um, he's, yeah you can, yeah I can see he's kind of weaker, and it's affecting him a lot. And um, that's <UNIN/> it's quite, I I guess he's um, had it for a little while now. Um so, uh not my brother. He doesn't live with me. I'm, I live with my, um sister and my mum. Um, I think, <UNSURE> I mean</UNSURE> in what sense do you mean that? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> I mean uh I think uh, yeah it's been, it's been tricky. Um Going to work with all of this. Um I dislike um, taking time off work. I feel like I I just want to go, um when I can. So I <UNIN/> I try and go um I think at, at home, uh yeah I just haven't really um I I don't normally actually um, eat with my family. I normally am buying stuff and that kind of thing. So, I don't think it's affected them. And I haven't really been, haven't really gone into detail with my sister and my mom about it. Um Yeah. I'd, I'd just rather deal with these things. Um so <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Um So I work at a, I I work at um an office, um in Central London. Um it's uh, so I work in government. Um so I I smoke um, I smoke uh, uh for like socially, but not like regularly. Um So normally if if it's a, a Friday or something like that I might, I might have a cigarette or something like that. But um not <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. Sorry? So alcohol, um <UNIN/> uh you know I might have a a beer during the weekdays, maybe uh not that many, maybe um <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. On Fridays I have more um alcohol um But yeah uh, I'll have my units um Uh, honest, I suppose um, not every week, but maybe I'll once or twice a month, that yeah, I'll go out with my friends and drink a lot so that that's um, yeah um OK. OK. Uh-huh. Should I just drink like normal water? I just feel like every time I drink <UNIN/> it's just coming out. Um <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Do i need like a prescription for that? OK. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> OK. OK. So you're saying that I should, <UNIN/> I could, uh I'll try and buy this Dioralyte. What, what should I do in terms of um, food and that kind of thing? Should I just focus on fluids? OK. Is it OK for me to carry on having like, um Paracetamol and things like that? OK. Uh, OK I'll try. Yeah. OK. Alright. Thank you very much.

Good morning, Tim. Um, how can I help you this morning? OK. Right, I'm sorry to hear that. When, when did your symptoms all start? OK. And whereabouts in your tummy is the pain, exactly? OK. Did the pain come on quite suddenly, or was it more gradual? OK, OK. And can you describe the pain to me? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Just in, just below your belly button you uh, mentioned. OK. Um, and is the pain constant, or does it come and go? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> <UNIN/>. Mm-hmm. OK. Um, and with the pain have you noticed any other symptoms, at all? So, for example, let's, let's focus first on your bowels. Are your bowels working OK? OK. So you've got no other symptoms, like diarrhea or loose stools? <UNSURE>No</UNSURE>. OK. And, what about your waterworks? Are you passing urine OK? Mm. And when you mentioned pink urine, do you, was there any blood at all in your urine? Or was it difficult to say? OK, alright. But otherwise, it doesn't hurt, uh, or or or sting, when you pass urine? OK. OK. Um, OK. And um, moving on to <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> other symptoms, have you noticed any vomiting, or feeling nauseous at all? No vomiting. Any temperatures or fevers? OK, fine. Um, uh, uh, and Kim, have to ask um, uh <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> all all all <UNIN/> patients. This this question is about your cycle, if you don't mind me asking. Um, are you currently um, are you currently sexually active? OK. So you've had no other partner since then. OK. Um, uh, and do you use any contraception at all? At the moment, OK, fine. Um, are you still having periods? When was your last period? Two week scare, OK. So, is there any chance you could be pregnant? I know you've got an implement in there, but is there any chance you could potentially be pregnant? It's something for us to think about <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Yeah, OK. Well it's something for us to think about. Um, uh, maybe worth taking a pregnancy test later on, just to confirm that. Um OK. And, and so, just to summarize so far, if you don't mind, it's really for the last couple of days, it's tummy pain that's really affected you, mainly lower down towards your belly button. It's quite burning, you said. It's getting worse. Um, you noticed some pink urine. Um, but no burning or stinging pain when you pass urine. Your bowels are working OK. You've felt a little bit nauseous, um, and feeling hot and sweaty. Have I got that all right? Is there anything else, perhaps, that you feel like you should share with me at this stage, anything that might be important? Yeah, OK. Um, tell me, tell me a bit more about your um, medical history otherwise. Are you normally fit and well? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> OK. Um, have you had anything like this before in the past? Any similar symptoms? No, OK. Um Fine. Um, any other family history I should be aware of? Anything relevant, family, uh related to bowels, maybe related to <UNIN/> history? OK. Alright. Um, and socially, just tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's at home with you? OK. Um, and uh, are you currently working? What do you do for work? OK. Um <UNIN/> <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE>. Um, Do you smoke at all, Kim? No. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol? No, OK. OK. Um, just before I go to the examination, I just want to go through just some few screening questions if that's OK, yes or no. Uh, we've, we've covered the majority of them already. Uh, but I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything else. Um, how's your, <UNIN/> how's your chest? How's your breathing? Um, any <UNIN/> <UNIN/> OK. Any uh, funny heartbeats or rhythms, palpitations? OK. Any headaches? Any problems with your vision? No, OK. Alright. Um, Fine, OK. Um, So really just uh, moving on, um, And so based, based on your story really, uh, uh Kim it's, it's <UNIN/> it's difficult. <UNIN/> it's it's um, you know you've got some tummy pain. You don't exactly know what's causing it. It could be a few different things that could be causing your pain. Could just be a, you know, could just be a urine infection, for example. Could just be something related to your gut. Um, could just be something related to your, you know, a pregnancy-related cause. Um, and so it's probably worth doing some tests initially. to try and rule out um, what's going on here. Um, which I can organize for you today. Um, and basically those tests, we,  we'll have a better idea in terms of how we should proceed. But certainly, it <UNIN/> if it's been going on for the last couple of days, um, Uh, you know, it's probably maybe worth empirically treating you for a maybe urine infection. And, so it's an <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Yeah, absolutely. So, um I think it's certainly worth, you know covering you with some antibiotics today. Uh, but i still want you to bear in mind, you know, have a pregnancy test done to make sure we're not missing anything else here. And, um, and I want you to kind of really come back and see me in a few days time, if your symptoms are not getting any better, or indeed if they're getting worse. So, things to look out for would be, you know, worsening tummy pain, um, if you're feeling really hot or sweaty, your temperature's not coming down um, vomiting et cetera. Does that make sense? OK. Um, you can try just regular painkillers, uh, Paracetamol would be advisable. Um, make sure you drink plenty of fluids. You can try some cranberry juice as well, which uh, can sometimes help with your urine symptoms. Um, take the antibiotics, uh, and give me a call, you know, if you are worried about anything else. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Yeah, if I send it straight to your pharmacy, start the antibiotics today, something called Trimethoprim. Um, you can take two tablets, uh, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> one tablet twice a day for three days. Uh, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, let's see how you get on. Great. All the best! Bye bye.","<INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Um, so I'm <UNSURE>Having</UNSURE> some, some pain, uh, in my tummy, like the lower part of my tummy. Um and I've just been feeling, quite, hot and sweaty. About two days ago. Uh, <UNSURE>like</UNSURE> below my belly button, it's like quite, sore when I press on it. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, it hasn't been, it's more gradual and it's just, it is getting a bit worse now. Uh, it's kind of like a, a, I guess a burning pain. Uh, and it's just right there <UNSURE>yeah</UNSURE>, in that spot, like uh, that's mostly where I'm feeling it. It hasn't spread anywhere else. Yeah. It's pretty constant, it's like getting worse. Um, it's not like, I <UNIN/>, I can still move and walk around. Uh, I mean I'm still kind of functioning, it's just uh, I'm aware of it <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> time. Yeah, I had a bit of constipation, but that's better, now. That was like, since last week. No, I'm <UNIN/>, I'm, my bowel movements are normal now. Yeah, I'm <UNSURE>fine</UNSURE>, that's fine, that's. I did notice that I was a little, the urine was a little pink, in colour. But I haven't like, it hasn't really been burning, specifically or hurting when I pee and uh. And I did notice I was going to the, I was peeing more, regularly, but I have been drinking lots of fluids. So I wasn't sure, um, I wasn't sure, um, like <UNIN/> you know, if that was related to the pain. I can't say, I mean maybe. <UNSURE>And</UNSURE> I haven't noticed that it really burns or anything like that. Um, just that I'm, peeing more than <UNIN/>, more regularly. Just a little nauseous, um, but no vomiting. I haven't <UNIN/>, I felt a bit hot and sweaty, but I haven't really measured it, so I can't really say. <UNSURE>Yes</UNSURE>. Uh, yeah I've, I have had the same partner, I am, we were last sexually active about four days ago. Um, my last STD screen was normal, which was about six months ago. No, the <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. Uh, I'm, on the Implanon. I had the Implanon inserted about a year ago. Yes. Uh, my last period was about, three weeks ago. I mean, two weeks ago. Well, we don't use any other barrier, method so, we just use the <UNIN/>, I just have the Implanon and the same partner. Um. Theoretically, if the Implanon, hasn't been working then I could be pregnant, but I don't suspect <UNIN/>. Yeah, that sounds, very accurate. I don't think so, I think I've, you <UNIN/>, we've covered everything that's really bothering me. Yeah, <UNIN/>, well, I haven't had any, surgical, I don't have any surgical history. I don't have any previous, I haven't had any operations before, or, and I'm not on any other medication, I just have the Implanon. I've never <UNIN/>, I've never had these symptoms before. No, not that <UNIN/>, not that I'm aware of, no. Uh, I live in a share house, <UNSURE>and</UNSURE> with two other, two other room-mates. Yeah, I currently, I am currently <UNIN/>. I am an accountant. No. Uh <UNIN/>, socially I drink, but uh, I don't think more, more than normal. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. All right. I don't feel short of breath uh, or, I'm not having any problems, or I don't have a cough or anything that's <UNIN/>, worrying me. Not that <UNSURE>it</UNSURE>, no. No. OK. <UNIN/>. Yeah, I <UNIN/>, can we do that instead of me, going for tests, and then seeing how that goes? Yeah, I think I'm happy with that plan. Uh, sure. That sounds great. Thank you very much.

Could just be a, you know, it could just be a urine infection, for example. Could this be something related to your gut? Could this be something related to your, you know, a pregnancy-related cause?

And based on those tests, we will have a better idea in terms of how we should proceed. But certainly, if it's been going on for the last couple of days, you know, it's probably maybe worth empirically treating you for maybe a urine infection. And so with some anti-pain.

Take the antibiotics and give me a call if you are worried about anything else. Yeah, but I'll send it straight to your pharmacy. Start your antibiotics today, something called trimethoprine.

Can I just get you to confirm your name and date of birth for me, please? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Date of birth? <UNIN/> And your date of birth? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Again, how can I help today? OK. So, <UNIN/> it started this morning, was it a sudden onset headache, did it come on suddenly? OK. And did it come on really bad or did it start off, uh, <UNIN/> like a slight headache and build up to a, a severe headache? And if <UNIN/>, if ten is the worst pain you've ever felt in your life, how bad would you say the pain was between one and ten? It's not ten. Great! OK. No, that's fine. Have you ever had a headache before? Have you ever had a headache like this in the past? OK. So, it's a first <UNIN/>. OK. OK. If you had to say where uh, uh,  across the head, uh, the headache is, is it across the front, around the back? And tell me what visual problems are you getting? OK. OK. And, um, have you tried any painkillers for this already? OK. Um, OK. Um, what time did you take the paracetamol? How long ago was it you'd taken it? OK. Um, and your visual problem is still ongoing now? OK. OK, Um, so, what about, <UNIN/>, have you felt sort of nauseous or like you want to vomit? Still <UNSURE>feel</UNSURE>. All right. OK. You've mentioned, in the past, you've had kidney stones, any other medical problems? Uh, you've mentioned that in the past, you've had kidney stones. Have you had any other medical problems in the past? <UNIN/>, what else do you have in the family? Ohh, can you still hear me? <UNSURE>Ohh</UNSURE>, it's gone. You can hear me. Um, you said, you mentioned your mother has migraines. What else do you have in the family? <UNSURE>Hyperthyroid</UNSURE> OK. Bye. OK. Um, and no other relevant family history? And do you take any regular medications? Are you allergic to any medications? OK. Is there any chance you could be pregnant? Fine. And so, you're not allergic to any medications. Fine <UNSURE>from</UNSURE>. And what, what were you thinking might be going on? I know you seemed quite worried about it. Was there anything in particular you were worried about? OK. OK, fine. Um, now just, uh, another, uh, question, have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs, anything like that? Uh, and when you're walking, you're able to walk fine in a straight line or is your, your uh walk, are you walking a bit funny? OK. OK. So, just, just to clarify what, what you said <UNIN/>. This morning, uh, you woke up and then later on in the, in the morning, about four hours ago, you've developed a headache? Um, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> on the left side of the head? Left side of the head, is it <UNIN/> behind the eye? Is it behind the eye? Is that where the pain is? Um, you've <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. OK. That's fine. You've noticed that your vision is blurry, there's funny lines, you feel a bit nauseous, you vomited twice. Um, and, uh, you feeling dizzy as well, but your, you've got no neurological symptoms.

So, um, usually with, with migraines they can present at different times in people's lives, so, sometimes they can present as a child, sometimes they can present when they're older. Um, and sometimes they can present, you know, even postmenopausally. So, there's different, there's different ways you can get migraines. Uh, and the reason why this sounds like migraines is because it's on one side of the head. <UNIN/> typical of a migraine, you've got blurry vision, again which is very typical, with the nausea and vomiting, that's also typical of a migraine. Now, um, uh, <UNIN/> obviously, if the <UNIN/> headache is really severe, and I'll suggest some medications you can try, if that doesn't work, we would want to see you, um, as soon as possible, to do like a full neurological exam as well. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> to make sure that, you know, there's, you know, when we do a more specific examination that, um, everything all seems fine. Um, I <UNIN/> I would recommend in the time between now and when we can see you, uh, if you take some medications, maybe something like ibuprofen? So, yes, a migraine, yeah, no, you know, even sooner than that, we can look at maybe half an hour to forty minutes, depending on what your response to it is, for some people, Uh, whatever medications they take the migraine doesn't improve, um, and they can last from anywhere from four hours to seventy two hours, migraines can last. Um, but <UNIN/>. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> No. So, what, there's lots of medication treatments so, there's, it can be ibuprofen with an anti-sickness, um, so and <UNIN/>, which you can get from the pharmacy. Um, and you also to drink, uh, sugary and carbonated drinks, something like Coke. For the three of them is, uh, is a good sort of cocktail to start them, then we can go up the treatment ladder, you can get specific migraine relief medication. And that should be something to try between now and when we see you to do the, um, to do the assessment. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> assessment to where we can see you today at some point. And, but however, if you do take these medications and, you know, by the time your appointment time comes in and you feel much better in yourself, you can cancel it, um, you can give us a call and cancel it.

Hello. Hi. My name is Dr. Kumar. I'm one of the GPs here. Can I just get you to confirm your name and date of birth for me, please? Date of birth. And your date of birth? Again, how can I help today? Okay, so it started this morning. Was it a sudden onset headache? Did it come on suddenly? Okay. And did it come on really bad, or did it start off like a slight headache and build up to a severe headache? And if 10 is the worst pain you've ever felt in your life, how bad would you say the pain was between one and ten? Six out of ten. Okay, no, that's fine. Have you ever had a headache before? Have you ever had a headache like this in the past? Okay, so it's a first. If you had to say where across the head the headache is, is it across the front, around the back? And tell me what visual problems are you getting? Okay. Okay. And have you tried any painkillers for this already? Okay. Okay. What time did you take the paracetamol? How long ago was it you taken it? Okay. And your visual problems are still ongoing now? Okay, okay. So what about, have you felt sort of nauseous or like you want to vomit? Still feel all right, okay. You've mentioned in the past you've had kidney stones. Any other medical problems? You've mentioned that in the past you've had kidney stones. Have you had any other medical problems in the past? What else do you have in the family? Oh, can you still hear me? Oh, it's gone. You can hear me. You mentioned your mother has migraines. What else do you have in the family? Hypothyroid. Okay, fine. Okay. And no other relevant family history. Do you take any regular medications? Are you allergic to any medications? Okay, is there any chance you could be pregnant? Okay, fine. And so you're not allergic to any medications. Fine. And what were you thinking might be going on? I know you seem quite worried about it. Was there anything in particular you were worried about? Okay. Okay, fine. Now, just another question. Have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs? Anything like that? And when you're walking, you're able to walk fine in a straight line or is your walk, are you walking a bit funny? Okay. Okay. So just to clarify what you said, this morning you woke up and then later on in the morning, about four hours ago, you've developed a headache, mainly on the left side of the head. Left side of the headache. Is it behind the eye? Is it behind the eye? Is that where the pain is? You've also noticed that your vision is okay, that's fine. You've noticed that your vision is blurry, there's funny lines, you feel a bit nauseous, you've vomited twice and you're feeling dizzy as well, but you've got no neurological symptoms, you're walking fine, and you've taken paracetamol and it hasn't helped. Is that what you're correct? Okay. So it sounds like what you're suffering from is what's known as a migraine. Is that something you've heard of before? Okay. Okay. So usually with migraines, they can present at different times in people's lives. So sometimes they can present as a child, sometimes they can present when they're older. And sometimes they can present, you know, even post-menopausally. So there's different ways you can get migraines. And the reason why this sounds like migraines is because it's on one side of the head, which is typical of a migraine. You've got blurry vision, again, which is very typical with a nausea and vomiting. That's also typical of a migraine. Now, obviously, if the headache is really severe, and I'll suggest some medications you can try. If that doesn't work, we would want to see you as soon as possible to do like a full neurological exam as well to make sure that when we do a more specific examination that everything all seems fine. What I would recommend in the time between now and when we can see you, if you can take some medications, maybe something like ibuprofen. So yes, a migraine, yeah, not you know, even sooner than that, we can look at maybe half an hour to 40 minutes, depending on what your response to it is. For some people, whatever medications they take, the migraine doesn't improve and it can last from anywhere from four hours to 72 hours. Migraines can last. But I'll be something. No, so there's lots of medication treatments. So it can be ibuprofen with an anti-sickness, which you can get from the pharmacy. And you also to drink a sugary carbonated drink, something like Coke. So the three of them is a good sort of cocktail to start them. Then we can go up the treatment ladder. You can get specific microleave medication. And that's just something to try between now and when we see you to do the assessment. Assessment where we can see you today at some point. But however, if you do take these medications and by the time your appointment time comes in and you feel much better on yourself, you can cancel it. You can give us a call and cancel it. Any questions for me? All right, okay. Any further problems between now and your appointment, please do let us know. Okay, bye.","Hello, yeah, I'm Maria. Yeah, sorry. 27 of March of 90.

And my notice that my face has just been feeling a bit numb recently. It's been a few weeks now. And that three weeks or something. Just one side, just on my left side. I've noticed that the hearing's kind of gone down a bit. Yeah, so again, it's the left side. It's kind of like around my left ear and kind of along here. So like my jawline's just all feeling a bit numb around here. Not that I've noticed. I think occasionally notice that's tweaking in my ear. That's part of it or not. No, no, no, no, nothing like that. No. No, no. No, that's all good. Yeah, it's kind of there quite often, so I recall the time. So yeah, right now it feels very, doesn't feel like when I touch this side of my face. No, nothing, nothing coming out. No. No, nothing like that. Oh, no, no, no, don't use coffee bugs, anything like that. I've, well, I've got kind of been told I had polyps in my nose in the past and occasionally get some kind of heartburny feeling. That's all fine. And, you know, I take a renies if I need to. And if my polyps are playing off, I've got a spray. Other than that, I think they said ages ago I had something called, can't quite remember, but lab bring fitness, something like that. But again, nothing on yeah, so no, I only take the spray to my nose when I need it for, and sometimes take over like renies, but I just get that from the chemist. Yeah, they gave me a prescription ages ago. Unfortunately, I don't, sorry. No, just latex. My brother had neurofibromatosis, I think it is. Other than that, everyone else is okay. Yeah, so I'm a jockey, but because of all the kind of symptoms I'm again, especially sometimes when I get a ringing, I can feel a bit busy. I've just had to do far less training. So kind of beginning to, yeah, impacting work a little bit now. Yeah, yeah. I live with my partner. No, no pet. No, just like, like I said, like the ringing occasionally, and when I get back, I can sometimes feel a bit busy. But the main thing is really the lack of hearing and the numbness that's got me upside. Yeah, no idea what's going on there. I mean, there was just like there was one thing I think just because I can panic and you can look online and get a bit frantic. I guess what I'm trying to think is, you know, is there something particularly serious that you know will need to be sorted and obviously really anything could make you really frantic instead. Is it hopefully nothing so serious I will die from it? I don't know. I just I think I've got a pickle. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. That's fine. Okay. Yep, no, we'll do it. That's fine.

May I confirm your name and date of birth, please? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Nineteen eighty three. And, are you in a space that's private and quiet, and you can talk? Good. So, it says, erm, I've got a note to say, it says you're feeling short of breath. Is that correct? OK. Are you able to tell me a little bit more about that? That is, while you're sitting watching TV? OK. And, have you noticed anything like this before? OK. And, apart from the shortness of breath, have you noticed anything else? OK. OK. And, how long ago was that? Just a few weeks? OK. And, are you with baby at the moment? And, how is baby doing? OK. Any coughs or colds with, uh, them? OK. So, you've noticed shortness of breath for just an hour, while sitting <UNSURE>and</UNSURE> watching TV? And, you had your C-section a couple of weeks ago? And, yesterday you noticed a cough? So, talk to me about the cough. Have you bought anything up? And, when was the last time you were ill with the flu, or symptoms like this? OK. And, this shortness of breath you're having, is it getting worse? OK. So, you're feeling your heart more than normal? And, the shortness of breath, does it cause any pain in your chest? How about when you take a very deep breath in? OK. And, since your C-section, did you have to take any medications? <UNSURE>All right.</UNSURE> And, can you remember what the name of those were?

So, we'll start in three, two, one. Go. Great. That should be enough. How many did you count? Good. So, your heart is running slightly fast at the moment, which is probably because of the shortness of breath and some of the pain that you're under. Given that you've had a C-section, and you're short of breath, which has come on quite recently and quite quickly It might be worth you going into the hospital to get checked out the bit further. So, there's two ways of us doing this. The first is, I can call an ambulance. Or, you can take yourself to the hospital with baby. Which one would you prefer? Sure. And, what I would suggest is, go fairly quickly and take some bits for baby at the same time. And, if you're taking any medications like Codeine, don't, don't take them for the time being. Is anyone else with you at home? OK. So, I think that's the best thing to do, for the time being. So, what I'm worried about at the moment is, given that you've had a C-section Some people can suffer with clots. And, those can either be found in the legs or your chest, so in your lungs. It's quite a common thing to happen. And, it's not something to worry about. But, needs to be checked out in the hospital first.

Okay, are you able to tell me a little bit more about that? This is while you're sitting watching TV? Okay, and have you noticed anything like this before? Okay, and apart from the shortness of breath, have you noticed anything else? Okay. Okay. And how long ago was that? Just a few weeks? Okay, and are you with baby at the moment? And how is baby doing? Okay, any coughs or colds with them? Okay, so you've noticed shortness of breath for just an hour while sitting and watching TV and you had your C-section a couple of weeks ago. And yesterday you noticed a cough. So talk to me about the cough. Have you brought anything up? And when was the last time you were ill with a flu or symptoms like this? Okay.

How about when you take a very deep breath in? Okay. And since your C-section, did you have to take any medications? And can you remember what the name of those were?

It's quite a common thing to happen and it's not something to worry about but needs to be checked out in the hospital first.

Yeah, I can. Can you hear me? Hi, my name is Doctor <UNSURE>Gohill</UNSURE>. I'm <UNSURE>one of</UNSURE>, Hi, I'm one of the physicians that works at Babylon. Are you in a quiet and private space to <UNSURE> talk</UNSURE>? Good, and can I confirm your name and date of birth please? Seventy four, and how old does that make you? Perfect. Great, and it says here, um, it says you're having chest discomfort. Is that correct? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> OK, can you tell me a little bit more about your chest discomfort? When it started, and how you're feeling at the moment? <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE>. Great. So, you've talked about your chest. Are you still in, discomfort at the moment? OK, and when it started, how would you rate it out, out of ten? OK, <UNIN/>. <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE>, and how about now? OK, and tell me before this happened, what were you doing? OK. OK, and how often do you do gardening? OK, and are you normally fit and well? So, are you <UNIN/> normally OK to garden as you would? Great, and apart from this, do you have any other medical problems? OK, so that's high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. Do you take any <UNSURE>medicines</UNSURE> for that? OK, and are you allergic to anything? OK. So, let me summarise what you've told me already. You were gardening a few hours ago, and you experienced chest discomfort, which was roughly seven out of ten. <UNSURE>And it</UNSURE> feels more like someone's sitting on your chest, as opposed to pain. And apart from this, have you noticed anything else unusual, specifically with your breathing? OK, and is that getting worse or better? And when you get short of breath, when you're walking up the stairs, have you noticed any pain? OK. So, let me confirm. You have the pressure at the moment, and you have shortness of breath, is that correct? <UNIN/>. So, given what you've told me about your past medical history. I think it might be worth, you calling an ambulance. <UNIN/> get you to the hospital as soon as possible. Because, my concern is, it might be something to do with your heart. So, <UNSURE>While</UNSURE> <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> to you, I will ring an ambulance. Who, should come to your address. But in the meantime, I think we should stay on the phone. So I can gather some more information, that we can give to the paramedics. Is that OK? It's nothing to worry about at the moment, but, given that you've got high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and you've got some chest pain. I'm always worried about the heart first, before anything else. <UNIN/>, <UNSURE>and we</UNSURE>, and we need to look after your heart before anything else. So, apart from this <UNIN/> light-headedness, and this chest discomfort, have you <UNIN/> noticed anything else unusual? <UNSURE>Did</UNSURE> you have anything to eat or drink this morning? And you feel, still feel nauseous at the moment? So, I have a couple of other questions to ask you, and I'm gonna reel them off. So, <UNSURE>apologies</UNSURE> for not letting you talk very much. Have you noticed this pressure, radiating to your head? And how about to your left, or right arm? And does that pain go anywhere else? To your left arm, or to your back? And, have you noticed any problems swallowing, or drinking water? Good. And have you noticed any problems going to the loo? And you're normally fit and well, apart from the two things you told me about? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> And, do you live at home with your wife at the moment? <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE>. I would suggest, if she's there, you let her know that, you'll both be having an adventure to the hospital today. So, she might need to get your things together. The ambulance should be there very soon. In the meantime, I would suggest that you stay calm, and have some water if you need to. Don't <UNSURE>take</UNSURE> any of those medications. <UNSURE>And</UNSURE> the paramedics should be with you, very shortly. So, when they do come, there are two things they will be worried about. The one is your chest, so, your heart. And <UNSURE>the second</UNSURE> is your breathing, which is your lungs. So, they will give you lots of things to breathe through, and attach things to your arms. Just to check, things like your blood pressure, and your heart rate. So, don't be worried. And, when you get to the hospital, you'll be seen by a consultant, pretty, pretty much immediately. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Sure. So, I will let the paramedics do their job. And when, you're at the hospital, the consultant would normally call me within a couple of minutes, to let me know how everything's going. Great. I'll um, book another appointment, to see you soon. Uh, <UNIN/>, once you've had your adventure. No problems. Do you have any questions for me? Great, thank you very much. <UNSURE>Bye bye</UNSURE>. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>","Hello.

Hi, can you confirm your name, date of birth and your home address, please? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Your address. And are you in a private place where you can have a consultation today? What can I do for you? OK, um, so when do you think you were last well? So do you think it started when you were on holiday or after you got back? Were you well when you were on holiday? Did you get any infections, chest infections, diarrhoea, vomiting, anything like that? OK. So, just tell me what symptoms you've been having, in terms of just your general health. Any persistent cold symptoms or earaches, sore throat, chest <UNIN/> cough, shortness of breath, phlegm, anything like that? Any change in your weight at all? OK, and are you eating different amounts? Any difficulty swallowing or acid in your throat, or abdominal pain? Any change in your bowel habit, diarrhoea, vomiting or blood in the stool? Any difficulty passing urine or blood in the urine? OK, and any other general symptoms like rashes? Or. OK. OK. OK, right, yeah, whereabouts was it? When did you first notice it? Did you have any fevers at that time? Do you know where you got that, when it started? Had you been walking, did you get any bites that you noticed? OK. Whereabouts were you in the States? OK, and any headaches, blurred vision, tingling, numbness? And have you been able to go to work as usual? And what's your job? OK, and has your concentration been affected, or your tiredness levels in the daytime at work? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Have you been able to exercise OK? OK, fine, and, um, how's your mental health, your stress levels, all that? OK. Apart from that rash, any other rashes on your skin, or swelling of your joints, or pain in your joints? Any <UNIN/> swelling that you've noticed? <UNSURE>Your</UNSURE> hands, wrists, ankles, toes. OK, um, and any other significant medical problems in the past? Pardon? OK.

Yeah, that's fine. Um, and do you smoke? Drink any alcohol? No. OK, and who do you live with at home? Um. Sorry, um, so with this rash, we would need to investigate whether this has been a contributing factor to your symptoms. And just because of your symptoms, which have been ongoing for six weeks, that's obviously quite a long time to notice a change in your energy levels. Um, I think it's important to get some blood tests, checking all the normal things, like liver, kidneys, blood count, <UNSURE>etc. But</UNSURE> also, some more specific things like, um, a bacterial infection you can sometimes get, uh, including one which you can get which can produce a rash like that. So, that would involve blood tests. Are you happy to do that? Well, you can get, uh, you can get a bacterial infection caused which is called, um, it's called lyme disease that you can get a rash <UNSURE>like</UNSURE> that from a tick bite. So that's something we would do a test for, as well. Um, and if that comes back positive, then there are specific antibiotics that we would give you to treat it. So it's definitely worth checking for, but we would also check just for <UNIN/> which can cause reduced energy, tiredness and aching for, persistent over six weeks.

Um, <UNIN/> coming, I, I don't really know what's been going on, but it's just aching all over, but, <UNIN/> definitely the last six weeks, it might have been slightly longer than that, but it's just sort of that, feeling really tired, run down. Uh, where are we now, we've just started April. I, definitely Christmas, New Year, I felt relatively well, I think. Um, so, since then. Actually, yeah, I, I was on holiday in, um, in the States. And yeah,  it probably coincided with some time around then. End of January, start of Feb. Uh, probably a couple of weeks after I got back. Yeah, had a had a great time, very active, uh. Um, no, not that I recall. Um, yeah, not. No, the symptoms sort of all started afterwards. Uh, no. Uh, I don't think so. Like, I'm probably less hungry, but no, no weight change, just a bit. Uh, yeah, probably slightly smaller portions, or it, yeah, more of an effort to, to actually eat everything that's in front of me. No. Uh, no. No, that's all fine. Um, I don't have any rashes now, but there was, uh, in fact I've got a photo, um, on my phone if if that's helpful. I can try and show you, hang on. Um, because this, yeah, this was weird, this sort of came up, and then, uh. Disappeared after a couple of weeks, <UNIN/>where's the light, <UNIN/> that, you see that? Uh, I think sort of calf, back of my calf, because I didn't notice it, my wife noticed it actually. Um, probably, uh, around the end of February, the middle to end of Feb. And then it, like, it didn't actually cause too much itching, or anything, at the time. And, I, it faded over a couple of weeks, I guess. Um, I, to be honest that actually turns out it was a bit of a sore throat I had, um, so possibly a little bit feverish, but I, I sort of put it down to that. Uh, I <UNIN/> like,  I do quite a lot of walking, and we did, um, quite a lot while we were out in the, on holiday as well, but definitely, um. Yeah, I mean, I don't, I don't recall any bugs, I don't remember seeing anything bitten but you often, like, yeah, as you're walking through, I was in shorts and, and boots but <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>/ Um, just sort of, um, he examined me, so. Um, no. But it's the sort of headache maybe in just generally feeling a bit crappy. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Um, I've been going to work. I don't know how effective it's been. But, yeah, been, been. Um, I work for a health technology company actually. Yeah, definitely sort of tired and, um, yeah, less energy, sort of probably <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> than I, I would normally be. Um. Not as much. I, I don't know if it's, I haven't been able to or I've just been a bit lazy with it. I <UNIN/> I'm not exercising as I would normally. Hey. <UNIN/> Pretty good at the moment, actually. Like, it previously that has been an issue, but, um. Other than, sort of, physically feeling a bit. Uh, crappy, I've. Yeah, in a pretty good place. Uh, yeah, sort of aching shoulders, back, the hips, knees, but sort of, yeah. Not <UNIN/>, No, <UNIN/>. Uh, no. Uh, I mean. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> <UNIN/>Asthma and hay fever if they can help. Uh, no, <UNIN/> pretty well <UNIN/>, I think. Uh, yeah. I've got one of those, um, preventative, I think. Yeah <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, but I've not used one. I, I have it. I've been using the <UNIN/> everyday for the morning and night but not the, uh, <UNIN/>. Um, <UNIN/> I take, um, one of the antihistamines <UNIN/> it might be <UNIN/> can I get that from, just from the pharmacy. <UNIN/> uh, <UNIN/>. Sorry, occasionally, that was. Uh, just my wife. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Uh, yeah, I <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> but, uh, what, what's the infection? OK. OK. OK. OK, so, do the test first and then, <UNIN/> and that follow up we can just do over the phone again? Or, <UNIN/> yeah. <UNSURE>All right</UNSURE>. Excellent.

Um, I'm Doctor <UNSURE>Deen Mirza</UNSURE> from GP at Hand. Nice to see you. OK. Before we start your appointment, could you please tell me your first name and your date of birth. OK, that's great. Thank you for that. Um, are you in a private place where you're OK to speak freely? <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE>, OK, great. OK, so um, tell me a bit about what's been happening? <UNSURE>You said</UNSURE> you mentioned in the notes that <UNSURE>you've</UNSURE> got a problem with your elbow. <UNSURE>Sure</UNSURE>. Sure, sure. <UNIN/>, and <UNIN/>. <UNIN/>, and so, did you say it was the left elbow or the right elbow? Left elbow, OK. <UNIN/>, and have you banged that elbow? Do you have any kind of injury? Sure, OK. <UNIN/>, and um, <UNIN/>, in terms of your job, do you do anything physical? Right. OK. <UNIN/>, and um, has this happened before? Sure, OK. Uh, and can I um, can I just double-check? Has anyone in your family, got any, kind of rheumatology, diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis, or lupus or anything like that? OK. Sure. <UNIN/>, so you know you said you think you've got <UNIN/>, uh, osteoarthritis. Has anyone ever told you that? Have you ever seen a doctor who's confirmed that, and told you you've got osteoarthritis? OK. <UNIN/>, was that a GP or a specialist or, was it, a <UNSURE>physiotherapist</UNSURE>? GP, OK, all right. Um, look can I just, uh, sorry can I just double-check how old you are please? Fifty three, OK. Fantastic. All right. Um, and, do you have any other illnesses at all? Right, OK. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. OK. Uh, <UNSURE>are you</UNSURE>, are, are you allergic to any medication? No. Sure. <UNIN/>, and um, do you um, are you on any medication on a regular basis? No, OK.  And are you normally fit and well? Mobile and active? OK, good, good, glad to hear. Well done that's <UNIN/>, it's good that you're doing that on a regular basis. OK. Um, and um, uh, can I, is it possible for me to have a look at your elbow, now? OK, good, bear with me one second. Right, OK. And if you can just raise your elbow up a little bit like that, a bit higher, so I can just see the underside. OK, fantastic, all right. And then, just, bring it round to this side, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, I can see other side. OK, fantastic. All right. And if you can just touch the tip of your elbow with your fingers. There's, <UNIN/>, is it, is it hot, compared to the surrounding skin, the adjacent skin? It's a bit warmer. OK. Um, and um, is it very tender when you're pressing on that nerve? Is it, if you, if you give it a press, does it hurt you at all? OK. All right. Um, well, um, I noticed the skin was a bit dry, <UNIN/>, on the tip of the elbow. Do you, do you have dry skin anywhere else on the body? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, <UNSURE>do you</UNSURE> <UNIN/>, do you suffer from eczema at all? No. Alright. OK. So um, what I think we should do, with regards to your elbow problem OK. Is um, I think, it would be worthwhile. <UNIN/>, this seems like uh, what we call the Bursitis. OK. So, that's an inflammation of one of the fluid sacs around the joint. Um, what I think we should do is, I think you should be on some anti-inflammatory medication, in the, in the first instance. And, as well as that, what I would like to do, is to get some blood tests done, to check for other types of uh, causes of joint swelling. K? So, um, what we're going to do is, we're going to arrange some, um, blood test forms to be sent out to your house. And, there'll be instructions within that pack, about where to go to get those blood tests done. And, that will involve you, um, having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers, infection, rheumatological antibodies. So we'll do a full screen, and also check for things like Gout as well, OK. Um. The time frame for that, will be um, the results will come back to us after about five <UNSURE>or</UNSURE> six days. Um. From now, but it may take time for the form to come out to you. And if you get the form get the blood tests done straight away, by the time that we're expecting result back, you know one or two days after that, we're looking maybe six days. And, what I would suggest, is, we can arrange a follow-up appointment for you, in one of our clinics, where we can have a look at your joint, feel it, we can review the blood test. Uh, we can um, get a gauge as to, uh, what's going on. Now in terms of your joint right now, It doesn't look like, to me that's something called, excuse me, septic arthritis. So, we're worried sometimes that someone might have an acutely infected joint. Um, and uh, your, your joint doesn't look like that. However, if your, the elbow was to become very red, very painful, uh, and the redness was to spread or become uh, you know more intense. Then you need to get on the phone or get, have a video appointment <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, with one of us as soon as possible. 'Cause that would be an emergency. That would require more immediate assessment, more immediate treatment. OK? No. I, I don't think this is anything dangerous. <UNIN/> don't need to worry. OK? What I'm doing, is I'm just outlining the worst case scenario if things were to, to <UNSURE>develop</UNSURE>. K? So, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, this, this is not the case right now. Right now, it looks quite straightforward. <UNSURE>It's</UNSURE> nothing <UNIN/>, sinister or life-threatening. Um, what I'm doing is I'm just saying, in case things worsen, these are the things that we'd be looking out for, and this is what we have to do. But you don't have that now, thankfully, and I don't think you're going to have it. But I'm just saying, the what if scenario. Is that OK? All right. Did you have any questions that you wanted to ask me? OK, all right. Um. OK. So, I, I would take Ibuprofen regularly, OK. You can get that <UNIN/>, over the counter. Um, that's four hundred milligrams, two times a day. And you should take, take that after food, not on an empty stomach. If you get any heartburn, stop taking it. OK. All right. So, what I wanna do is, I'll get the <UNSURE>forms</UNSURE> sent out to you. And, um, we are going to arrange a, a follow-up appointment. Maybe within a um, actually you know, the follow-up appointment doesn't have to be face-to-face, if it's more convenient for you do, to do it over the phone, we can do that over the phone, uh, over video. We can do that as well, that's, that's your call. But you contact us, <UNIN/>, after you've had the blood test done, and we can review things then, OK. Sure, sure that's a good idea. All right then, OK. Um, take care then. So <UNIN/>, <UNSURE>look</UNSURE> just leave that with me, I'll sort all those bits and pieces out, and then we'll get them sent out to you, and then we'll, we'll um, review you after the tests, things goes well, OK. All right <UNSURE>then</UNSURE>. Take care then, all the best. Bye bye.","Hello, good morning. Nice to see you. Yes. Uh, my name is John Smith.

Hello. Can you hear me okay? Right, excellent. Before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age, please? 19 years old. Okay, Amanda, and how can I help you this afternoon? Right, okay. I'm sorry to hear there's a lot going on there, and I can see why it's affecting you. So, you mentioned it's been getting for the last three days, mainly the burning pain when you pass urine. You say you're going to the toilet more often as well. Is that right? Oh, in the week, sorry, okay. Have you noticed anything in your urine, for example, any blood or discoloration of urine? Okay, any kind of frank blood, I mean, red blood at all in your urine. Okay, um, fine, well, we'll have to definitely explore that in a little bit more detail later on. Um, you also mentioned some tummy pain as well. Can you come in a bit more about that pain? Okay, um, can you describe crampy pain? Is it more of a burning pain? Does the pain move anywhere else? Does it move towards your back, towards your sides? Okay, all right. Um, any other symptoms at all, for example, nausea, vomiting, okay. Any temperatures or fevers? Okay, all right. And how are your bowels at the moment? Are your bowels working okay? Okay, and what when we say you have problems, what kind of problems do you normally have? The more you are, the better. Okay, all right, but you've noticed no new symptoms, no, no, no, new symptoms in your bowels. Okay, all right. Um, and Amanda, sometimes we have to ask quite sensitive questions, as you can imagine. Um, uh, can I ask, are you currently uh, are you currently sexually active at the moment? Okay, and um, have you noticed any other discharge from down below? So, from the front passage, okay. Have you do you use any form of contraception? What kind of pill is it? A combined pill or the mini pill, okay, fine. Um, when was the last time you had um unprotected sex? If you don't want me asking, yeah, exactly. Yep, okay, all right. What I'm trying to get at is whether um there's any chance you should be pregnant at all. I know you're on the pill, but we nonetheless we do have to ask. Um, when was your last, when was your last period two weeks ago? Okay, all right, just something for us to bear in mind if your symptoms don't get any better, okay? Um, fine. In terms of your general health, otherwise, at the moment, are you eating and drinking okay? Sure, well, thanks for sharing with me. Um, so I don't think it is related to your symptoms, I think it's probably just pure coincidence. Um, but uh, you know, I do strongly advise you to you know, um, make it a regular habit if you can, um, just for your general health moving forwards, okay. Um, fine, moving on in terms of your health, otherwise, do you have any other medical conditions apart from the IBS? Is there anything else I should be aware of? No, okay, great. And what about any medications that you take on a regular basis apart from the combined pill? Yep, okay, okay, and as that for the cramps, the crampy pain, yeah, okay. And do you have any allergies, any medications? Okay, okay, right. Okay, sure. I'll make a note of that. Um, in terms of family history, any history of problems with the bladder or the kidneys? Nope, or Johnny, anything else? Good. And socially, tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's at home with you? Very good. Great. And what are you studying at university? English. Okay, good. And how are you enjoying your course? Very, very good. Good. In terms of smoking and alcohol, do you participate in either? Okay, what made you have your first joint last week? Was that sure? And obviously, your doctor's helping me to look after you. So I would strongly recommend you, you know, to avoid if you can. Great. Fine. So at this end, I wouldn't normally examine you, but I think based on your story, I think I'm reassured by the fact that I think it's probably just a simple, what we say, a UTI or a cystitis, bladder infection. You know, you haven't got any other symptoms that suggest to me that there's anything to worry about. So things like fevers and back pain would be more worrying for me to hear. So something we can treat quite readily with antibiotics. So we've got a choice of two antibiotics, something called trimethoprin or nitroferontoin, which is a three-day course. Normally, they're usually quite effective for your symptoms. It's probably worth giving us a urine sample today as well if you can, so we can send it off to the lab and see exactly what's going on there. Start the antibiotics, make sure you're well hydrated, drink plenty of fluids. If you are having some pain, simple paracetamol would probably be advisable. We'll see what the urine sample shows. And if it is indeed positive, we'll know which antibiotics are the right ones. But if things are still not getting any better next week, come back and see me and we can have another look again. So if I'll give you no, well, good question. So I will give you, I will organize for you to come in and drop off a sample one of our practices, which we can test there and then the urine dip and send off to the lab and we can always get back in touch with you with the results. Okay. Do bear in mind those symptoms I mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting. If you have any of those, give me a call, okay? Okay. Have a good day. Thank you.","Yeah, I can hear you. Hi. Sure. I'm Amanda Jackson and I'm 19 years old. So it's been going on for a few days now. It's not happened before and I'm a bit worried. It hurts when I kind of pee. And yeah, it's like I'm going to the toilet a lot more and it's really like I can't like go to uni properly. I'm just like constantly looking for the toilet. And it kind of hurts sometimes when I'm like at the bottom of my tummy as well. Yeah, it's been going on for a little bit longer than three days, I think, actually. Maybe just under a week. Sorry, no, I didn't explain it properly before. Yeah, no, it's been going on for about just under a week. And yeah, I noticed sort of burning, stinging when I go to the toilet. Yeah. I think, well, today I noticed that it was like a bit pink, the urine. Yeah, I think just today. I think it was mixed in, probably. I don't know, it was pink. Yeah, it's kind of at the bottom of my tummy. Mainly when I go to the loo, I think that's when it's worse. I wouldn't describe it as crampy. I don't think it's like a period pain. It's a bit different. It's hard to say, an achy pain, I suppose. No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, vomiting. No, no, not that I've noticed. I usually have a bit of problems with my bowels anyway, so I don't think it's any different from what it usually is. I think I have IBS. So I just kind of pass my bowels like quite a lot. And sometimes it's quite variable, like sometimes it's a bit softer, sometimes it's a bit, it's sorry, this is a bit disgusting, but sometimes it's a bit harder and kind of hard to predict. No, no, not that. Yeah, I have a long-term boyfriend. No, I don't think so. Nothing unusual. Yeah, I'm on the pill. Combined pill. I mean, I mean, unprotected, is it like no condoms or anything? I guess because I don't really use condoms with my boyfriend. I don't know. We've just kind of agreed. So I guess a week ago, two weeks ago, quite recently. Two weeks ago? Yeah, yeah, meeting, drinking, okay. I did have one kind of concern. I don't know. So I smoked, this is quite bad, but I smoked weed for the first time like a week and a half ago. I just wonder whether it's related at all. Probably not, but I just thought I'd get some advice from you. Okay. No, no. Apart from the pill, I take something for the IBS as well. It begins with an M. It's really hard to pronounce, like mebe something. Maybe. Yeah, yeah, that's it. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think there was an antibiotic called Klindus Klindamycin missing that I took like a couple years ago something. And yeah, that didn't go too well with me. No, no. So I am living in halls at the moment at uni. So I'm just living with a flatmate, I suppose. But my family live kind of outside of London, not too far away. So yeah, my family are fine and I see them now and then. Yeah, things I think are okay generally. I'm studying English. Yeah, it's going well. Thanks. Just kind of started a few months ago, a few months ago. Yeah, I really enjoy it. Yeah, yeah. It's really fun. As I admitted before, I tried weed for the first time, but I don't smoke. I drink occasionally kind of socially with friends. It was just a party. There were other people doing it. I kind of was a little bit tipsy, so probably wasn't thinking quite straight. But yeah, I completely agree. It's not something I want to get into on a regular basis. Sure. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Great. With the urine sample, how do I go about doing that? Do you know, is it through the app? Okay, perfect. Great. Eva, that phone thing. Great. Okay, yeah, I'll chat with those. Okay, great. Thank you. You two have to say. Bye-bye.",hello can you can you hear me okay right excellent before i go any further can i confirm your name and your age please amanda okay and um fine and moving on in terms of your health otherwise do you have any other medical conditions apart from the ibs is there anything else good and socially tell me a bit more about your home situation who's at home with you um so and i'm as your doctor i'm here to look after you so i would strongly recommend you you know to avoid if you have any great um fine so as i said i wouldn't normally examine you but i think based on your story i think um you know i'm reassured by the fact i i think it's um probably just a simple what we say a uti or a cystitis bladder infection um you know you haven't any other symptoms that suggest to me that there's anything to worry about so things like fevers and back pain um would be more worrying for,hi yeah i can hear you sure um i'm amanda jackson and i'm nineteen years old um so it's been going on for a few days now um it's not happened before and i'm a bit worried i i it's quite hurts when i kind of pee um and yeah it's been going on for a week um i think it's i think it's a bit disgusting but like sometimes it's a bit softer sometimes it's a bit harder and it's kind of hard to predict um yeah yeah um so i am living in halls at the moment um uni um so i'm just living with a flatmate i suppose um but my family uh live kind of outside of london not too far away um so yeah my family are fine and i see them now and then um i think i think i think okay okay okay okay okay with the urine sample um how do i go about doing that do you know is

And say ah. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Perfect. Thank you for that. Excellent. OK. Last thing, is if I can get you to feel inside your neck. Just on the sides here, OK, um, by your Adam's apple. Tell me whether you can feel any enlarged glands or not. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. OK. All right. Um. Now, um, uh, <UNIN/>. Sorry, I've forgotten your name. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Doris, OK Doris. Um, so, so Doris, um, what, what I think we need to do, is um. This sounds like you might have a chest infection. OK. If you're coughing up blood, and you're feeling your heart racing. Um. Uh, I think, you need to be examined today, someone needs to listen to your chest. And, um, maybe check your blood pressure as well, check that, you're stable. I have to say examining you now, from what limited, examination I could do online. You're, everything does seem to be OK, in terms of, you, you don't seem acutely unstable. However, if you've got, this kind of pain, um, when taking a deep breath in and you're coughing up blood. We do, do, we do need to assess you to figure out whether you have <UNSURE>a</UNSURE> Pneumonia or chest infection. And um, that would involve someone listening to your chest with a stethoscope, and you may need um, an antibiotic. Uh, there's one thing I need to ask you. Have you been, on any long-haul flight recently? No, OK. Have you ever had any clots in your legs, or clots in your lung? Blood clots? No, OK. Anyone in the family have that? No, OK. All right. Um, what I think we'll do is um, we'll arrange for you to get reviewed in a clinic today. OK. Um, I would like someone to listen to your chest, and check your blood pressure. And to, to recheck your pulse as well. Just make <UNSURE>sure</UNSURE>, and check your temperature, make sure all those parameters <UNSURE>are</UNSURE> OK. You may well need an antibiotic, OK. Um, do you have any allergies to any antibiotics? No, OK. Um, I, I'm not, I'm gonna, not, I'm not going to prescribe anything for you now, because I think you need to have that, basic assessment first. Um, before we proceed to the next step. But the, that's what I would predict the next step might be. Um, I'm going to leave the number in the notes for this appointment, for you to ring our support team. And then, they will, book you in for a face-to-face appointment with one of our GPs today. And <UNSURE>then</UNSURE>, they'll do that assessment, and then we'll take it from there, OK. Um, uh, given the, the way in which you uh, have presented now. Just one day, with a fever and, this slight pain, <UNIN/>, concurrent with the, the blood in the, the, the flem. That's not usually how lung cancer is <UNSURE>presented</UNSURE>. It's more insidious, over a longer period of time, with other symptoms. Um, however, we might need to get some investigations to exclude that. It depends on the examination finding, when we see you. All right. <UNIN/>, are you worried about lung cancer? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. Sure, of course yeah. So, just remind me how old you are again. I'm sorry. Forty five, OK. It's something we do need to be cognisant of, OK. Um, and, we may end up having to do a follow-up chest X-ray, if things don't settle down. But at the moment, it, it seems more like a chest infection, rather than a lung cancer. Yeah, that, that is good to know, yeah, so that's, 'cause that's easier to treat. But we still need to make sure that things are OK because, chest infections can become nasty as well. <UNSURE>It</UNSURE> can lead to infection inside the body, <UNIN/>, we want to avoid that as well. So, let's get you checked out today, and hopefully we can put your mind to rest, <UNSURE>and</UNSURE> get you on the right course of treatment. All right, you're welcome. All right, take care then. All the best. Bye.","Hello. Lovely to meet you. Uh my name is, Tracy Chapman, and, um, my date of birth is. <UNSURE>God</UNSURE> <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. <UNIN/>, I'm forty five.

I'm Dr. Dean Misler from GP at Han. Nice to see you. Okay, so before we start your appointment, could I please confirm your full name and date of birth? Just tell me how old you are. 45, okay. Could you confirm the first line of your address and your postcode? That's good. Okay, thank you. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment? Okay, fantastic. All right, so tell me what's been going on. You said you were a bit short of breath. Is that right? Right, okay. Okay. And how long has this been going on for now? Right, okay. Any other symptoms at the same time that you've had this pain? Right, okay. Okay, all right, it might all be connected then. And yesterday before this, all of this, were you completely fine? Okay, so you can feel your heart kind of beating a bit faster, you think, than normal? Is that sure? Okay, all right. And how long has that been for? The tiredness and not wanting to exercise a couple of weeks. Okay. And then the last day or so, that's when you get the cough and the pain in the side and you've coughed in blood. Okay, all right. You said you felt a bit warm. Have you measured your temperature at all? But that would be just feels hot with that. Okay, fair enough. All right. Okay. And now, can I just ask, do you smoke at all? Okay. What do you work as? Okay, all right. And do you live alone? Yeah. In a flat or a house? Okay. Do you have any pets? A cat. Okay. Are you on any medication at all, regular medication? Methotrexe. Okay, what are you on that for? SLE. Okay. Do you have any other diagnoses, any other illnesses at all? Right, okay. And do you have any allergies for any medication? Any other allergies at all? Okay. So you're taking methotrexe at the moment. When was the last time you had methotrexate? You had it this morning. Okay. All right. All right. Okay. A couple of things I'd like to do in order to try and get an idea of how unwell you are. Okay. The first thing I'd like to do is to try and measure your pulse. So the way we're going to do this is that if I can get you to try and locate the pulse on your wrist. Not everyone can do this, so don't worry if you can't. But if you can tell me whether you can feel the regular pulse, it's just under the thumb. If you put your fingers up and down like that, you might be able to feel the pulse. You've got it. Okay. Are you sure? All right. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to tell you when to start counting and when to stop counting, okay? So I'll just get my stopwatch up. Okay, so if you can, you've still got the pulse? Okay, so if you can start counting now, please. If you can stop now, I think that was about 11 or 12. So that would make your heart rate about 66 to 70 fold. That's okay, good. Fantastic. And the next thing I'd like you to try and do, okay? It depends on the lighting, so it may not be possible. But the next thing I'd like to try and do is just get you to squeeze the tip of your finger and then let me see how quickly the redness comes back. Okay, so if you can see what I'm doing now, my fingers come up right behind the screen. I'm squeezing it, okay? Just watch me first. Sorry, just watch me first. I'm squeezing it, and then you can see that it goes pale, then it goes back to the normal red colour, okay? So if I can get you just to put your finger up to your camera, and then with the other hand, just try and squeeze it and see if it's like perfect, that's great, thank you so much. The last thing I'd like to do is I'd like to try and have a look down your throat. Are you doing this consultation via a phone or a laptop? A phone. So say that again? Okay, fine. Okay. So if you position your device up above your head, put your head back, mouth open wide, and let me see if I can have it. That's panting. Say, ah. Perfect. Thank you for that. Excellent. Okay. Last thing is if I can get you to feel inside your neck, just on the sides here, okay, by your Adam's apple, tell me whether you can feel any enlarged glands or not. Okay. All right. Now, sorry, I've forgotten your name. Doris, Doris. So, Doris, what I think we need to do is this sounds like you might have a chest infection.

And  just to confirm, that you're in a secure location, and we can have a confidential conversation. Right. So you've mentioned that you have some pain in your jaw. Is that correct? OK, so numbness in the left arm, yeah? How long has it been going on for? Mm hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. So, have you mentioned that message and a warm bath, any medications that you've taken so far? Uh huh. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> OK. Mmm. Sure. Of course. So <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> you just mentioned that your pain is from elbow downwards, is that, you know, the tingling, numbness elbow <UNIN/>.  Not from your shoulder? Yeah. So, which fingers do you feel numb? Uh huh. Second, third and fourth finger. And is it your palm side or, you know, the back of your hand side which is numb, or both? It's the front side. OK, right. And have you been dropping things at all? Like, you know, when you try to <UNIN/> hold onto things, like a glass or something, have <UNIN/> dropping it? Mm-hmm. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> <UNSURE>So</UNSURE> So you would say this in mind weakness, mind. <UNIN/> So <UNIN/> just to <UNIN/> get my facts right. So you would <UNSURE>say it's</UNSURE> definitely weakness rather than because of the pain, you can't hold it. That's two different things. So you know sometimes you can't hold it because it's hurting you <UNIN/>. OK. <UNIN/> Fine. So, you're definitely having some sort some form of weakness, OK. <UNSURE>Edward</UNSURE>, any neck pain at all? <UNIN/> neck pain and all? OK, right, OK. So, just a bit more of a background because I don't have much information on the system. Um, do you have any past, uh,  medical history that you'd like to share? Mm-hmm. <UNSURE>what</UNSURE> <UNSURE>Mm-hmm</UNSURE>. OK. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Do you have any headaches at all, from the, in the recent past? Hmm. Do you wear glasses at all, <UNIN/> glasses, contact lenses? No, so no glasses <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. And, you've not <UNIN/> experienced anything like a seizure or a fit, anything like that? Like when you <UNIN/> you <UNIN/> lose consciousness and you start shaking. <UNIN/> OK, no fits, yeah, OK. And your weakness is only in your left arm. Legs are walking and all this, normal, yeah? You mentioned for a while you couldn't see, you know, the outside peripheral vision from your left eye. How long did that episode last for? Sure, OK. Um, OK. So is there any regular medications that you're using? OK. OK Alright. And any family history you'd like to share? Any <UNIN/> significant family history? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, right. Any neurological conditions in the family? there are related conditions. No, OK, that's fine. OK, so, right. So after, you know, speaking and examining, you know, yourself, I think it's quite important that we do investigate it a bit further. I'm just wondering whether there's something a bit more than just the boxing here. OK, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> few things that's, made me think other than, just like a boxing injury, is for instance, um, you know, when you said you can't, your vision went, your <UNSURE>peripheral vision</UNSURE> was not there for about <UNSURE>twenty</UNSURE>.

You take care. Good bye now, bye.","Hi. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Sure, my name is Mary Smith. My date of birth is August sixteen, nineteen seventy six. My email address is Mary dot Smith at gmail dot com. Absolutely. Um, well. I think that's just, like, the first thing that I typed, but, uh, uh, it wasn't really what I, you know, I just typed it and then I clicked submit, so, that was uh, um. I mean it's part of the problem but I would say that, more of a problem for me, is that I can't quite move my left arm. I mean, I can move it but it's it's numb, and then I also feel some, like tingling in my fingertips. <UNSURE>Yes</UNSURE>, yes. So, I've started taking this boxing class. I've been taking this boxing class for a few weeks, and I feel like maybe, um It's probably been, I'd say, for at least two weeks, and it's kind of gotten worse. Like,<UNSURE>in the beginning</UNSURE>, I just kind of felt a little bit of a tingling. and then it's gotten, it's gotten worse since then. Then the numbing kind of started I can feel it both in my, uh, um, you know a little bit in my elbow, and then in my arm, as well as in my hand And <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> now because it hasn't gotten better, I tried to get a massage, it's not better.  Or, you know, try to take warm baths. It's not better, so I figured I'd call you and, and just figure out what's going on. Uh, well it's. You know it's, it's numb and I, I kind of looked at stuff online, um, but you know I, I do take Ibuprofen because my muscles were sore, a little bit, and I've been taking this boxing class. So, you know, I kind of hurt like my knuckles on my right hand. So that's been a little bit painful, so I've just kind of taken ibuprofen for that. But, like I said, I mean, I tried massage, I tried some hot baths, and that didn't help with this numbness <UNSURE>thing</UNSURE>. I'm just kind of getting a little worried. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> And, um, well it's kind of funny, you know sometimes I will feel it in my shoulder. Like if I try to, if I try to like you know move like in boxing and stuff, I will even like, uh, um, maybe feel a little bit of, a little bit of pain. Uh, but I would say, if i'm just like resting <UNIN/> if I'm sitting like, right now, I can feel like it's numb, and I, I actually feel, tingling right now,  not in all of my fingers, just in some. OK, so it's my second, third, and fourth finger. No. It's, it's the, it's this side. So, the front side. Yes. So not so much with the glass, but I will say, um, well I play a little bit of a piano and so I just noticed it's been kind of harder to get the notes. I can, I can grasp, I can grasp a <UNIN/> a glass but because I use my right hand most of the time, you know, I'm not left handed so, it's kind of hard for me to. Yes. Yeah. No, no, it's not hurting, it's not hurting, it's, like, numb, I can't feel it, right? Well, yeah. <UNSURE>Yes</UNSURE>, absolutely. No, not, no, nothing <UNIN/>. Mm hmm. Well, I guess because of this. You know, I'm not sure if it's boxing. I also had a really bad cold, like a month ago. I mean, I was out, you know, drinking with, uh, friends, um, one of our co-workers just had his three year anniversary and We kinda went crazy and we were like out partying until, you know, late hours, and I just got uncharacteristically drunk for me. And then after that, I was sick for probably good like two weeks. I was at home. I think I must have had some kind of like a flu or something. So it's that. And then, I'd say another weird thing that happened to me a few weeks ago, is like, I all of a sudden just couldn't see from the, uh,  from my left eye. Like, I, I lost some, like a little bit of a field of vision Uh, and, but that, that just lasted not very long. I mean, that just lasted maybe for, I don't know, twenty, twenty minutes? Uh, and I kind of thought, I don't know maybe it was the the cold you know and the virus and all that so I, I guess that's what I can, you know, that's the last thing I can remember, but in general, I'm, I'm pretty healthy. You know, I work out, uh, <UNIN/>, and I, I don't really have any medical problems. Um, sometimes I get headaches but I think they're just tired headaches. You know sometimes I'll get kind of Tired but I think that's probably because I work too much. Or, you know because like I'll go for a workout and then I'll really just exhaust myself and then I just kind of feel this fatigue. Uh, or sometimes like this morning for example, I just felt really,  fatigued and I couldn't even get myself to the gym. But, you know, since I have this numbness it's kind of like, hard to <UNSURE>workout</UNSURE> right? No. What's a seizure? Ohh, no, no, no, no, nothing like that, mmm mmm. <UNSURE>Right, exactly.</UNSURE> Yeah, yeah, yeah, walking is normal, yeah. You know I think it was only maybe like twenty minutes or so. It's almost like it happened and I thought ohh my God. It's probably I'm still like sick from this, you know virus thing, cold, and so I just kind of slacked it off.  And then when I, uh, um, when I woke up it was gone. Not really. I just take ibuprofen every once in a while, I take vitamin D. Um, I take some I, I like my <UNIN/> my GP really wants me to take iron supplements, but you know, they're just like huge pills so I, I, most of the time I just forget. But, vitamin D I take. And then, sometimes I take Melatonin to help me sleep. I know that my dad has I don't know if it it's hypo, I think it's hypothyroidism. Um, and then my, like, he's got he's got some autoimmune stuff going on, like that much I know. And then, my mom, my mom, she's actually not in a great shape. She's got diabetes type two. She's got hypertension, um, she's got, gosh, what is it, ohh, yeah, she's got high cholesterol, um, and I think that's it for her. Yeah. Uh. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> OK. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> What do you think may be going on? Ohh! Ohh my God! Will I be in a wheelchair? K, OK. <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE> <UNIN/> I see. Yeah yeah yeah! Yeah, I'm here, I'm here. Yeah. Alright. Yeah, that makes sense. Well, what's, OK, so you're gonna do the referral, um, should I be taking any drugs or, um Mm hmm, yes, OK. OK, got it. Sounds good! OK, thank you, doctor. <UNIN/> Thank you, doctor.

So and that with the weakness of the arms make me think, is there something else going on rather than just injury? Sometimes, you know, you do get things like MS, multiple sclerosis.

I recently had one for like two days, but it just went away with aprobropen, so nothing like for longer than two days before. It just started all of a sudden. I woke up one morning with a headache and that was three days ago and I just keep having it. Doesn't really go away with apographin either. I try that, but it just gets a little bit better, but like doesn't go away. It's kind of all over, but I feel like over my right eye is a bit stronger. Lights definitely make me more sensitive. Like I don't really like strong lights. And yeah, vision, I think I get this shooting light sometimes. I'm not sure how to explain it, just a bit of a weird kind of vision. No, I'm feeling a bit sick, but no, I'm vomiting. No. No, not at all. I would say quite normal headaches, just a bit of a pressure in between my eyes, but nothing major. Kind of all the time.

Maybe lack of energy, but it might be because I'm just having this headache, so I find it quite difficult to go through my daily activities, but you know, when you have this constant headache, I work from home, but couldn't really manage to do it all the time, so sometimes I just took a day off. So I work from home all these three days, and first day I work from home, and then the second day I just took the whole day off. And today I just tried to work from home the first half of the day, but I just stopped in the morning because I couldn't focus. I think I only had a bunal pain when I was younger, but no cause was found and that went away. But that's the only thing I know of. No? Just a pill. Marcelon? About a year ago. No, I don't think so. No, because this headache just started recently, so nothing, but nothing really changes. No. No, no. No, nothing, none of that. Yeah, I had a choice in the pharmacy when I got the pill and they say it was normal. About a year ago. No. Sorry? Just by myself? No. Yeah. Probably like three beers once a week. No, apart from the upper broken diet, sometimes when the headache gets really bad, nothing else. Yeah. No, I didn't. I don't really feel feverish or anything. Okay. Okay. Yeah, it's not. But you mentioned migraine and that reminded me that my mom suffers from, like, she has migraines. No, I think that's it. But I know that my mom, like, she has quite bad migraine. She has the vomiting and everything. Okay. Okay. Is there anything in the pill that can cause it or is it all right? Okay. So would you like send me a referral to a specialist or do I have to teleport to control? Okay, perfect.

So what I think we can do is I think we can give you some generic pain relief that would be the appropriate first step for migraine type headaches. Okay, so I'll tell you what it is in a second. And the other thing that I was going to suggest is we maybe look explore things to try and decrease the stress from work. So the medication wise, the things that we start off first line if someone had migraine would be to start ibuprofen and the doses of ibuprofen can be a bit more than the normal doses of ibuprofen so that's one thing we can start you can keep on taking paracetamol as well if you like but the ibuprofen is um actually more effective for migraine and um yeah so the guidelines have changed recently we before that we used to give paracetamols first line but now it's um ibuprofen or aspirin that's interesting um the other thing i'd like to do is maybe consider taking some time off work okay because if the headaches are due to stress from work um maybe having a week off if you self-certify that might help with things and i'd also like you to explore counselling options as well so there's a counselling service in your area that i can give you the link for for you to self-refer i'd like you to like to try that um what we're going to do is we'll have a follow-up in a week's time as well as those two things other things i'd like you to do is to try and ensure that you're having a minimum of seven eight hours sleep at night every night a minimum of um 1.5 to 2 liters of water or fluids a day and that's not including coffee or tea all right because sometimes dehydration and you know fatigue can be causes of headaches as well um yeah so that that is um you know we need to rule those things out um let's let's try that okay um and let's have a follow-up appointment if we're finding that things are not getting better we might need to arrange some blood tests or look at other possibilities but we'll try that in the first instance if anything changes in the meantime or you get worried or things get worse feel free have a low threshold for ringing us back and booking an appointment and we can reassess the situation okay no problem so there'll be a summary of all of this in the notes um and i'll also leave a link to some of the danger signs and symptoms of headaches in the notes if you can read through that in your own time that will just help you to have a bit more control over what's going on and understanding of what kind of things should trigger you contacting another doctor no problem okay so we'll we'll touch base in a week's time with me myself or one of the other doctors and we could we'll take it from there okay brilliant okay then all right take care then all the rest bye bye","Hiya. Hi there, my name's Ertin. Sure, so it's Ertin Warren, and my date of birth is the 16th of May, 1982. I am, yes. So I kind of woke up this morning. I've just got this really horrible pain on the left side of my head, a real kind of headache feeling. Yeah, it woke me up quite early this morning. Probably around 5:30-ish. I normally get up at about seven o'clock. Yes, it is. I mean, I've had a bit of a history with headaches, but nothing as severe as this before. Not so much on the one side. It tends to be a bit of a cluster at the front of my head in a way. But this time it's just kind of more prominent on the left side, which I've never really had. Normally, they're kind of spread across the front of my head. No. No. I'm a little bit sensitive. It just kind of makes my eyes a little bit sore, but nothing that I can't really handle. Not really. Like when I first got up this morning, my head felt a bit dizzy, but that's kind of subsided now and it seems to be fine. No, they haven't. Work's kind of a bit stressful in the moment. I've got a lot going on. Yeah, I just seem to have like a lot of kind of a backlog of work that I need to go through at the moment. So I've kind of been doing a lot of late nights as well. Probably about a couple of months now. I'm not like moody. I'm not angry or I get a bit frustrated during the day. But it kind of ebbs and flows every now and then. But yeah. I've had, so I had like anxiety for about two years now and I've been on search really for a while. Yes. No, not necessarily at work. Sometimes I do feel a bit anxious. I kind of just the panic of not being able to get my work done on time. But other than that, I don't feel massively anxious. No. When I lay down, like it kind of feels a little bit sore at first, and it takes me a while to get comfortable. So yeah, at the beginning it does, but then again, that just kind of soothes a little bit. Yeah, I would say so. I've taken some paracetamol. Not really, no. No, that's it. Just paracetamol. None. No. No. No, there's nothing. My parents, my mum's had a history of anxiety as well, but no kind of like physical illnesses or anything like that. No, other than Serchrilline and having taken paracetamol this morning, nothing else. Not that I'm aware of, no. I live with my partner. No. I have a cat. So normally I try to go running at least three times a week. It's okay. It's nothing, nothing really healthy. It's fine. I wouldn't say it's unhealthy. Sure. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, right. Okay. Okay. Yeah, that'd be thank you. Okay. Okay. Oh, I didn't realize that. Okay. Yeah, that sounds brilliant. Thank you so much for your help. Okay, so that's perfect.

Uh, yeah, I'm allergic to, Clindamycin. Um, I, I get some like a, a, a swelling, basically. Yeah. Uh, no I don't think so, not that I, not anything I know about.

OK, is there, is there anything like, like, should I be worried about? Like, like, not having sex or anything within the next week, or anything like this? OK, OK.

Hello. I can hear you. Can you hear me? Excellent. Just before I go any further, can you confirm your name and your age, please? Okay. And how can I help you, Mrs. Smith? Right, well, thank you for coming in. So hopefully we can help with your symptoms. So you mentioned it started a few days ago. So can you tell me a bit more about what kind of pain it is that you're experiencing? Okay. And the pain in your tummy, can you describe the pain to me? Is it cramping, burning, sharp? Right, right. Okay. Okay, fine. And have you found yourself going to the toilet more often than normal? No. Okay, fine. Have you noticed any funny colour to your urine? So has it been any blood in your urine or have you noticed any other darkening of your urine? Yes. Okay, fine. Okay. Right, let me just write a few notes down as well. Fine. And you mentioned the tummy pain. That also started a few days ago. Does the pain move anywhere else? Is it new towards the back or towards your flank, the sides? No. Okay. Fine. With the symptoms, have you noticed any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting? Okay, any fevers or temperatures? Sorry, any fevers or temperatures? Sorry, I didn't hear you. No fever, okay, fine. Sorry. Okay, in terms of your bowel, are your bowels working okay? Any diarrhea, loose stool? Okay, all right. And Jessica, sometimes we have to ask very private sensitive questions just to go get a full history. Hope you don't want me, are you currently sexually active? Okay, and is that with a regular partner? Fine, okay. Have you noticed any other discharge from down below? No, okay. When was your last STD screen? If ever? Okay, fine. And do you use any form of contraception at all? Use condoms, okay. And when was your last period? Let's go. Is there any chance you could be pregnant, perhaps? Is there any chance you could be pregnant? No, it's always worth asking young females like yourself. So if that obviously, if you are worried about the pain not getting any better, then I would always advise you doing a pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy. Okay. Fine. So just moving on, moving on. Are you otherwise fitting well? And so by that I mean do you have any other medical problems, medical history? Okay. Do you take any regular medications? Okay, so you've tried that and didn't help. Okay, all right. Do you have any allergies, any medications? And what happens when you take endomycin? Okay, so it's quite, it seems like a quite severe allergy to it. Is that right? Okay. Fine. In terms of your family history, is there anything I should be aware of? Related to kidneys, bladder, bowels, gut? Okay, all right. And tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's at home with you? Okay. Okay. And are you working at the moon or are you a student? Okay, and what are you studying? And how's that going? Great. Do you have any aspirations for the future in terms of careers? I recommend it for you, doctors. What about smoking and alcohol? Do you drink much in the way of, as a juju smoker, do you drink much in the way of alcohol? Socially. Okay. All right. Right, excellent. So at this stage, I'll proceed to examination. But based on your story, just to summarise, really, it's the last three days you've been having a bit of burning pain on passing urine, a bit of crampy tummy pain lower down, essentially, but no other fevers or back pain, if I understand correctly. I think you probably do have what we call a simple UTI or a urinary tract infection, bladder infection, which can be readily treated. So I'll give you a course of antibiotics today, something called either nitrofurintoin or trimethoprin. And it's normally a three-day course, so one tablet twice a day for three days, and that should hopefully help your symptoms. But I also advise you to drink plenty of fluids. Let's try and flush that, you know, that infection out of your body if we can. You can try cranberry juice, that can sometimes help with your symptoms. And if you're still not better by the end of this week, I want you to give me a call or come back and see me and we can have another look at your symptoms. Okay. Yeah, absolutely. And things to look out for would be, you know, if you are having kind of high temperatures, back pain, just generally feeling more unwell, you know, I do want to give me a call back because then we do worry whether your infection may be spreading up towards your kidneys, which is something we want to avoid. So do give me a call if you have any concerns, okay? I mean, if you can try and avoid it, I think that would be sensible. It's great at using barrier contraception. I recommend you to continue using barrier contraception, but if you can avoid it while your symptoms clear up, that'll probably be the best for you and your boyfriend. All right. Great. Thank you very much. Wish you all the best.","Hello? Hi. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you now. Oh, yeah, my name is Jessica Smith, and I'm 19 years old. Yeah, so I mean, this is a bit embarrassing, but it's kind of hurting when I use the bathroom when I pee. And it's been going on for a few days, so I'm a little bit worried about it. I'm not sure what to do. It's not too bad. It's sort of like a stinging kind of pain. It's not like unbearable, but it definitely bothers me, MyP. And yeah, I also maybe sometimes get some pain kind of lowered down in my tummy when I go to the bathroom. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe sort of cramping. I'm not really sure, but it's not like it's not like cramped like when I get when I have a period or something. It's like, I don't know. I don't think so. I haven't noticed it. Yeah. There was a little bit of blood earlier today, but besides that, not at all. No. It does kind of like doesn't smell very, it smells a bit weird, I guess, but no, not really anything drastic. No, not really, no. No, not at all. I don't think so. Yeah, I think we were just looking in it. I'm going to go to the bathroom, yeah. No, no, no fever. No. I think so.

Don't think I've ever, I don't think I've ever had one. Yeah, we use condoms a couple weeks ago. Say again? I don't think so. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah, I think I'm feeling okay otherwise. Yeah. So in the past, I've had some IBS, but other than that, I think no like no serious medical problems that seem yeah no. I did a little bit ago or a couple days ago try some over-the-counter bicarbonate to try and help with the pain, but it wasn't it wasn't really helping. Yeah, I'm allergic to clindamycin.

I do drink like on the weekends. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, so speak three days of the medication and then wait a little bit. If it still doesn't go away, call back. Okay. Okay. Okay.

I've just been studying for the past couple of days. I've been having the serious diarrhea and it's really giving me trouble. Because three days ago, now it's very loose, but it started as being very watery. I lost count. Today alone, I've been at least four times. Yes, I've been running at serious temperature. I'm literally boiling. No, because I've not gone, but like to the touch, I'm like literally roasting. Yes, I've been throwing up. I can't keep to, I can't seem to be able to keep anything in me, not even water, not even my tea, not even any liquid stuff. I've just been throwing up everything. I was sick just after trying to have breakfast this morning. So maybe about two hours ago. Yeah, I've been I've been urinating. Okay, is that what you mean? Like just to be honest, I've actually know how to look, so I really couldn't say at least an hour ago. No blood. Sorry, I didn't catch that. My bowel is normally fine. I'll normally go to the toilet every day, you know, in the morning, just once, yeah, and that's fine. No. No, but then my brother has actually been having similar symptoms for the past few days as well. And he does say like everyone in school's got it. So I don't know that might be from him. Yes. No, no rush. No, nothing. Well, apart from the fact that this one is giving me abdominal pains, no previous abdominal pains before. Although I get the odd, you know, menstrual cramps and all that, but you know, that's, you know, that comes and goes. It's kind of like towards my navel area, like I can't touch my navel area. It's just so sore. And it gets, yeah, towards like the center of my navel. Yes, it does come. When it comes, I feel the strong urge to go to the loo and then sort of releases me and sort of like comes again. It comes and goes. Well, I take my vitamins, actually vitamin D every day. That's about that's about all that I regularly take. Yeah, I eat well normally. Well, I don't smoke, but you know, I have a kind from time to time. No, like I said, I only take vitamins. For my metro camp, when it comes, maybe I might take a knife just to ease the pain. But two weeks ago, no. No. I'm a graphics designer. Well, yes, I've had to actually work from home today. I'm working from home today because I can't be out for work. I live with my brother and my mom. Well, I've tried a home remedy. I've tried the ORS thing above from my local host. The ORS, the salt, sugar, ORS mix, the salt, sugar mix. Yeah. I've taken that. I've taken that like three times a day for the past two days. To be honest, they're not getting any better because, like I said, I've been vomiting literally everything I take. So I doubt that even that has had the chance to work. Okay. So how do I get myself hydrated when I'm not able to even like drink water? I'm throwing up everything. Okay. Okay, so when can I come to the clinic to have this done? Okay. Okay. So what I'll do, yeah, if you could please book me the appointment and yeah, I'll see how I feel before the end of the day. Hopefully I don't need to go to A and E and I'll get better. Okay. Okay.

And do you feel faint when you stand up? What have you been doing for the last few days? Have you been at work as normal or had to stay at home? Okay, but you said the pain's constant there all the time or is it getting worse from time to time? Okay, and have you had any other medical problems in the past? Pardon? Okay, anything else? Have you had any operations? Have you had any pregnancies? Have you taken a pregnancy test this time? When was that? Okay, but not since you've had the abdominal pain. Okay, and any surgery in the past? And what's your job day today? Okay, and who do you live with at home? Okay. And do you smoke or drink alcohol? Do you take any other drugs? Have you been abroad recently? Whereabouts to? Padem? Oh, a year ago, not recently. No? And any problems passing water? Any pain or strong smell or having to go more often than normal? Right, okay. And any change any weight loss or blood in the stool or urine? Okay, fine. I think with the abdominal pain, as it's getting worse and it's been going on for the last few days, it would be very helpful to be able to examine you properly. Would you be happy to have an examination with the doctor? Okay, so what we can do is we can arrange a face-to-face examination where they can see you in a clinic and do an abdominal examination and advise further from them when we've got more of an idea what's causing the problem. Would you be happy to call the support line and arrange that appointment? Okay, that's fine. So we'll do that. In the meantime, if it gets a lot worse or you're not holding any fluids down, then we should see you before then. Did you say your pregnancy test was a month ago? Okay. And your implanon was just put in a year ago. Right. The other thing we would need to do is to do a pregnancy test today, if possible. So if you can do that today, and if it's positive, we need to see you straight away, so it gives a call back. Okay. Have you got any other questions? Right, okay. So if you call the support line and make an appointment, we'll go from there. Thanks.

Yeah, good, good. So my name is Joe. I'm a doctor here at Babylon. Can I just confirm your name, please? And your date of birth? Okay, great. And are you in a safe place? Oh, sorry, a safe and confidential place to talk. I'm just happy to go ahead with the consultation. Great. So how can I help? Okay, I'm sorry to hear that. So you've had a cough and a sore throat for about a week. And what came first? Okay, okay. And are you coughing up anything? Okay. So I'm just going to ask a few questions about your current symptoms and then a little bit about your background and something else about what we can do a little bit later on in the consultation to help you. But before I go on, anything you're particularly concerned about or have any ideas what might be going on? You said that you had a cold. Okay. Right. So yeah, I can provide a little bit of reassurance and we can talk about those a little bit as well. And was there anything you're particularly expecting or hoping to get out of this consultation? Sure, sure. Okay. All right. So we'll talk a little bit about the symptoms and I'm sure we can get those things, sickness and some reassurance about your concerns. So you mentioned that you started with a sore throat about a week ago, developed into a bit of a dry cough. I'll just ask a few questions around those. So do you have any shortness of breath? You are short of breath. And do you have any wheeze or chest pain? You're feeling a bit wheezy with some chest pain as well. Okay. And when did you start to develop a shortness of breath? Three or four days ago you started developing. And is the cough worse at night time? Same throughout the day. And when you say you're short of breath, just need to try and get an idea about how short of breath you are. So are you able to walk up a flight of stairs, for example, or are you short of breath at rest? And you're a bit concerned about that, okay? So I just need to ask a few things about your background as well. So do you have any other medical conditions or medical history? No past medical. No history of asthma. And any history of clots on your legs or your lungs. So these are DVDs or Ps. None in your family's had those clots on the legs or the lungs? Your mother had lung cancer. Do you smoke? Have you ever smoked or been exposed to asbestos? You know? Okay. And this, just going back to your symptoms of shortness of breath with the cough, it's a dry cough. No, you're not coughing up anyphlem. Do you have and you say you don't have any chest pain as such? Are you taking any medications currently at the moment? Okay, are you allergic to any medications? Peanuts, okay. And you mentioned that your mother had lung cancer. Any other family history of any significant illnesses running in your family? Just lung cancer. Okay. And you say you have a cold. So do you have sinus congestion or just your throat and any recent travel or have you always lived in the UK? Okay, so no, so no recent travel, no significant recent travel anywhere. Okay. And are you coughing up anything other than, so you're not coughing up blood or anything like that? No, no. Good. And are you feeling feverish, hot cold, sweaty? Okay. And in general, do you... Sorry? Yeah. Okay. And in general, would you say you're feeling you're beginning to feel better, worse, or sort of staying the same? Okay. And I just need to ask any other sort of risk factors that you may have. So no sort of significant weight loss or unexplained weight loss. Any wipers? You've been losing your appetite recently and you're a little bit concerned about that. But you haven't lost any weight that you think of. And any sort of rashes or anything? Okay. So I would ask to examine you now, but I don't know if I could sort of look inside your throat at least to see if there's a probably this. Oh no, well, no, it's okay. I might think about doing that. Have you got any lumps or bumps around your neck that you can feel? Not that you know, okay. And so finally, you were talking about, I mean, it sounds to me that you've been a little bit up and down, sore throat, developed a dry cough. You are slightly short of breath, but not too overly concerningly short of breath. What I would say, we're just coming to the end of the consultation now, is if you feel significantly worse, if you get more short of breath or sudden change in your breathlessness or breathlessness that you are concerned about, then I would advise you to seek medical attention against here, GP and actually see somebody physically. But I think for now I can sort of try and reassure you that if this clears up, as I expect it would, so I expect this to sort of be getting better in the next four or five days. If it's not, please get in touch with the medical professional gain. And I would expect it too, and so therefore I wouldn't be concerned about tuberculosis. Your concerns about lung cancer are... Was that the other thing you're concerned about? Yeah. So again, if you're not getting better, please see somebody again. I've just got four seconds now. So nice talking to you. And we've got to tidy up, yeah. Okay, so and I'll provide you with a sick note just to give you a few more days off work and paracetamol, lots of fluids and rest up. And as I say, if you're not feeling better, please get in touch. Okay? Thank you.","Hey, yes, I can. Can you hear me? Hey, my name is Vincent. 9th of May 2016. Yes, yes, I am. Yeah, so I have a call that I've been having a cough and a sore throat for about a week, and it's been causing me problems. I've had to stay away from work for about three or four of those days because of how bad it is. Yes. The sore throats came first, and then after a day or two, the cough. No, it's very dry. Okay. Well, well, I mean, you know how we all are. Once this happens, you Google it, and there seems to be all kinds of bad things. It could be, it could be, it could be a cold or flu, obviously, but it causes me tuberculosis, it could be cancer, always comes up. So it would be good if none of those well, yeah, so reassurance. So, like, hopefully, some sense that it's not anything too serious, but also if there's anything you can prescribe me to make it better, or any advice, or maybe even a sick note. So if I need to stay away from work for a bit longer, I can get one. Thank you. Yes, yes, we've been having shorts of oh, yeah, I've been having shortness of breath here. Yeah, a bit of a yes.

Oh, yeah, it's like when I'm doing walking, and I do exercise now and then. So it hasn't been super bad, like it hasn't stopped me from doing any of those things, but it's been pretty unusual and a little bit worrying. No, just no, no past medical history now. No. Well, my mother had lung cancer. No. Don't know if Asbestos ever smoked. I mean, once or twice in Amsterdam exactly, but not really. No, no. Not any medication, bamboogics, peanuts. No, no, that's the only one, just lung cancer from my mother. No, it seems to be almost entirely with just my throat. Like my nose is tiny now. No, so I haven't always lived in the UK.

Um it's also worth um using antihistamines, which you can sometimes buy over counter. Things like Loratadine or Piriton, which can help the itchiness of your skin. And uh, um it's also worth keeping a diary of any triggers which are affecting your symptoms, anything you wear or anything you use, in terms of shower gels or soap. Because if that's causing your symptoms, then we need to have a discussion about an eczema CU. Ohh, could you say that again, sorry? OK. <UNIN/> OK. So it's something for you to think about. <UNIN/> you can get different types of antihistamines. I can give you something a little bit stronger today as well. Um, something like Fexofenadine, which I can give to you today. It's definitely worth trying, and it's not going to do you any harm. Um but I <UNIN/> think using the steroids and the emollients, um on a regular basis Uh over the next week to ten days, should hopefully <UNIN/> control your symptoms. But do come back and see me next week, if things don't get better. OK? Um do you have any questions for me? OK. Well I wish you all the best. Thank you. Have a good day.","Hello. Can you hear me well? OK. Yes. So, it's been a few days now. I have like a sore, and a red skin. It's kind of, it's really itchy, and it's like super annoying. So I'd like to find something quick to solve it. Uh, mostly like my chest, my, my hands, my arms. Like, like really, it's it's super annoying. Like it's itching a lot, like all the time. And I can't even sleep at night. <UNIN/> I really need something quickly to, to solve it. Because even at work I, I can, when I'm in a meeting and I have to, like uh think about my work, I can't focus, I can't actually focus on my work. It's really annoying because I can't actually think about, uh, what I have to say. I'm always like, uh, disturbed by this disease. Um so yes. Uh earlier I was like prescribed for my eczema. And <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> they gave me like some cream, and something to, uh when I like <UNIN/> shower, when I was in the shower, had to put something. But um Um I mean, at that time yes. That's, those symptoms, like these symptoms appear like, when the symptoms appeared again, I tried those and it didn't work. I've tried a few things. Like I bought a, a steroid cream at the pharmacy last night. But it apparently didn't help, because it's still itching a lot today. Uh, yeah. A steroid cream. Um <UNIN/> it's much more like itchy. And my eczema was more like only in the arm. But now it's <UNIN/> also on the chest. And in the on the, on the hands as well. Like <UNSURE>pretty</UNSURE>, yeah when, like I like, for instance hiking, during the weekend. And I am, I can't really do it anymore, because it's like very <UNIN/> like I wanted to do that last weekend. And because super painful, and I I have to take like showers every day to be able to, cannot uh ease this itching part, which is very very annoying. Yeah. <UNIN/>. OK. No. Um so my skin is a bit cracked in some parts, like kind of cracked, if you see what I mean. But uh, yeah. No. Four days ago. No I <UNIN/>. It's actually like, it's really annoying, because I'm thinking about, <UNIN/> maybe I should change something. Because I I haven't, and I don't understand <UNIN/> I cannot, um afraid of asking people around me because it's cannot you know um, I don't feel really comfortable asking about these questions. It's kind of intimate that. So I <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> your help now. <UNSURE>Yeah</UNSURE>. Uh, no. Just the chest, hands and like, like inside the elbows. Yeah. Am I what? On my face? No. No. <UNIN/> just very itchy. Nothing else. No. I I think so. Any what? Um <UNIN/> so I had eczema before. So maybe it's <UNSURE>disease</UNSURE>, but it seems like more uh, like uh my eczema was only on the arms. So, I'm I'm not sure. I I really have no idea. Yeah. Uh, no. I just had asthma in the past. But not anymore. Uh no. I <UNIN/> like some <UNIN/>, sorry? Yeah? Hello? Yes. Ohh, allergies. Uh, no. Uh so, I live with a few flatmates. I'm a, so you know I'm thirty one. Uh I, yeah I'm I have a full time job. And so I'm living with a few people to save money. Uh I work uh at a pharmaceutical company. So it's been a, it's been a few years now. Uh it's uh, it's kind of interesting. We're working I'm a, like a kind of project manager. Uh I mean, do you want to, to know more about it? No. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Uh you know, <UNIN/> once in a while I can, I like hanging out with people once in a while. So yeah I'd say a few, a few beers per week. Something like this. Nothing, nothing crazy. I used to drink a lot more when I was younger. But it's been, it's been a while. <UNIN/> <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. Yes, I have tried antihistamines, uh lately, but it didn't really help. I have tried uh antihistamines, but uh but it didn't really help. OK. That sounds good. Uh, no that's it. Thank you very much. Bye. Thank you as well. Bye.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/BioRAMP/ASR/data/Primock-57/audio/day1_consultation02_doctor.wav,/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/BioRAMP/ASR/data/Primock-57/audio/day1_consultation02_patient.wav,559.2,559.2,"Hello? Yes, I think it's a bit better. It's a bit, it's a bit, it's not very clear, but let's continue anyway. Okay, let's start again. So, how can I help you, sir? Okay. No, no problems. I'm happy to help. Whereabouts in your skin is it affected? Yeah. No, no, okay. Sand, this is obviously affecting you, and we'll try our very best to get us sort of that for you. Have you had anything like this before in the past? Okay. Okay. Did it help? Okay. Do you remember the name of the cream you bought? Okay, steroids. Okay. Would you say these symptoms are very similar to your eczema symptoms or different? Okay. Yes. No. Well, okay. That's okay. So you mentioned the itchiness. You also mentioned it's been quite sore. Have you noticed any bleeding or discharge from your skins? Okay. You haven't got any other puss or blood coming out of your skin. No. And you mentioned it all started three days ago. Four days ago, are you aware of any triggers? So anything that you may have done that may have caused your symptoms to start? So for example, have you changed your shower gel, any clothing? Have you been around anyone else? Hmm. No, no, okay. That's okay. Fine. So just to re-summarise, for the last four days you've had very itchy skin, very sore skin all over your body, mainly your chest. And did you also mention your arms and legs as well? Okay, anything on your face at all? On your face? No. Okay. And apart from this, any other symptoms have you noticed? For example, have you noticed any temperature or fevers? Itching. Okay, so your bowels are working okay. Your chest is okay, no cough, no breathing difficulties. You're passing urine okay. Okay, all right. It's always good to know. So, I mean, do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms? Any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms? Okay. No, that's okay. So normally at this stage, I'd like to examine you to see the rash itself. I see exactly what type of rash it is. But from what you've told me, you mentioned you've got some dry skin and some cracked skin as well, and it's been very itchy. And so with your background of eczema, sorry, so there's a couple of questions I wanted to ask you, Richard. Apart from the eczema, do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of? Okay, not anymore. Okay. And do you take any regular medications at the moment? No. Okay. Do you have any allergies to anything? Sorry, I was going to say, do you have any allergies to anything? Hello? Can you hear me? Sorry, I think it cracked. Do you have any allergies at all? No, okay. And tell me about your situation at home. Who do you live with? Okay, and what do you do for work? Okay. No, no, no, that's absolutely fine. Just a couple of questions I want to ask you, which can sometimes affect your symptoms. Do you smoke at all? No. And do you drink much in a way of alcohol? Okay. Okay. Okay, I've got to say at this stage, I've got to say the sound quality is not great, but I will continue because we've come this far. So based on everything you mentioned, sir, I do wonder whether this is a flare-up of your eczema. The reason being that you said it's quite itchy, it's mainly affecting your chest and your back. And having looked at your skin, the rash does appear quite familiar. You mentioned using steroid creams yesterday from the pharmacy. I wonder whether giving you stronger prescription of a steroid may be beneficial, which I'm happy to prescribe to you today. As well as I'm going to give you something, some emollients, which helps to moisturize the skin, which you can also use in the bath and shower. And it's definitely worth using that for the first seven to ten days before we make a decision on whether it's working or not. It's also worth using antihistamines, which you can sometimes buy over the counter, things like loratidine or pyritin, which can help with the itchiness of your skin. And it's also worth keeping a diary of any triggers which are affecting your symptoms, anything you wear or anything you use in terms of shower gels or soap, because if that's causing your symptoms, then we need to have a discussion about that next time I see you. Oh, could you say that again? Sorry? Okay. Okay. So something for you to think about. You can get different types of anti-stamines. I can give you something a little bit stronger today as well. Something like fexaphenidine, which I can give to you today. It's definitely worth trying it. It's not going to do you any harm. But I certainly think using the steroids and the emollients on a regular basis over the next week to 10 days should hopefully control your symptoms. But do come back and see me next week if things don't get better. Okay. Do you have any questions for me? Okay. Well, I wish you all the best. Thank you. Have a good day.","Hello, can you hear me well? Okay. Yes, so it's been a few days now. I have like a sore and a red skin. It's kind of it's really itchy and it's like super annoying.

I'm Doctor <UNSURE>Deen Mirza</UNSURE> from Babylon. Good morning. Good morning. <UNIN/>. <UNIN/>, sorry, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, before we start. Could I get your full name and date of birth? Is that possible? <UNSURE>Yes, it's</UNSURE>, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. That's perfect, thank you for that. Are you, um, John, are you in a private place where you're OK to speak at the moment? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, perfect, thank you for that. OK. So, tell me what the problem is. You've been having some difficulty breathing. Is that correct? Right, OK. So, when did this bee sting or bee bite occur? Right, OK. Um, and, your, your lips don't seem swollen to me right now, but, do they, which. Can you show me with your finger where you feel it's swollen? Sure. <UNSURE>Sure</UNSURE>, OK. Uh, you said you've been having some difficulty breathing. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Your breathing seems all right to me right now. Um, the reason why I'm, clarifying <UNSURE>is</UNSURE>, because we have to decide whether this is a, an acute emergency. Whether I need to send you in to hospital straight away. Or whether we, more time to ask questions, OK. So um, <UNIN/>, do you feel like you've got difficulty breathing right now, this minute, as we speak? <UNSURE>Sure</UNSURE>, sure. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. Sure. No you, uh, you did the right thing and I, and I can understand it <UNIN/>, it is quite anxiety provoking, OK. All right. Can I just double-check? Before we carry on asking other questions. Have you got  history of anaphylaxis? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> No, OK. Have you ever been given an EpiPen? No, OK, all right. Let, let's, um, take a step back now. So, in terms of the bee sting, <UNSURE>it was a</UNSURE> <UNIN/>. Did you see a bee or you're, you're just <UNIN/>, um, assuming it was a bee? <UNIN/>. One of the two. <UNIN/>, OK. And, um, the area of your body that it stung. Where was it? Did you say it was your arm? All right. And you've got a rash there. Can I have a look? OK, all right. That looks OK to me right now. <UNIN/>, <UNSURE>does</UNSURE> it look red to you at the moment? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Yeah, yeah, yeah. The puncture mark, yeah, OK, all right. Um, now, is, is there any swelling, around that area, that you can see? I, I couldn't see any. Sure. OK, all right.Um, now, have you taken any medication? It's probably a <UNIN/>, you probably haven't, 'cause it was a few minutes ago. But have you? Is <UNIN/>. <UNIN/>, not taken <UNIN/>, any <UNIN/>, antihistamines or anything like that? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> OK. <UNIN/>, now, um, if I can just go back. Do you have any history of any <UNIN/>, any, kind of illnesses at all? OK, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. <UNIN/>, OK. Have you, got a history of any allergies to anything? All right, good. Um, and in your family, is there any history of any illnesses, or, any history of any kind of acute <UNIN/> reactions? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Right. <UNIN/>, and, um, do you have allergies to any kind of, cats, or dogs, or pets, or anything like that? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Yeah. <UNIN/>, and you've got no food allergies as far as you're aware? OK. Um, can I ask? Do you suffer from anxiety or panic attacks, or anything like that? Right, OK. Have you ever been on medication for that? <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE>. Um, great. Now, um, I need to ask a few questions, maybe not directly related to this, but just, it's for, for general information purposes. So, um, <UNIN/>, are you working at the moment? What do you work as? OK. And, um, <UNIN/>, you living alone? OK. Do you have any pets at home? <UNSURE>A cat</UNSURE>. OK, great. What I'd like to do now. If that's OK John? Is, I'd like to have a look inside your mouth, OK. Um, one of the things that, um, we'd be worried about if, someone's going to have an acute allergic reaction. Is to see whether there's any swelling, of the lips, or the tissues inside the mouth, or the. Soft tissues of the airway. And, um, I can, I've got a fairly good view of your lips, but I'd like maybe if you can, bring your device closer to your mouth, and then put your head back, mouth open wide. Sit somewhere where there's good lighting. And I just wanna have a look inside the throat, if that's OK? Perfect, OK, great. Now, um, um, can, can I just get you to do it again? And, just say ah, this time. OK, fantastic, brilliant. OK. Um. Uh, John. Based on, um, how you look. How you're talking to me, and how you're breathing, and the appearance, <UNSURE>and</UNSURE> your wrist. Um, I don't feel that you're having <UNIN/>, a, an, an, a life-threatening, uh, allergic reaction. Now it's very normal, to have, a rash, when you have some kind of insect bite. It's uh, it's a localised, um, uh, inflammatory reaction, that um, is normal and that <UNIN/>, immediate reaction, that redness, and that maybe slight swelling, is usually temporary. What we're worried about, is when someone has, um, compromise of their breathing. So you mentioned, breathing difficulties and you mentioned swelling of your lip. Thankfully I can't see any of that right now. <UNIN/>, but that's, the most, urgent and most pressing thing that we'd be watching out for. Given that it hasn't happened, initially, it's unlikely to happen later. OK we, so we have like a <UNIN/>, stage one and stage two reaction, for these types of bites. And, usually if you're gonna have the reaction, it will happen straight away. So, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, we may be coming out of the danger zone now, it's um. But I'm just going to warn you about what those signs and symptoms are, in case it happens. So for example. You would have, swelling of the lips, difficulty breathing. You might have something called stridor, which is an inspiratory sound that you, when you're trying, trying to breathe. It makes like a rasping sound, like this. OK. <UNIN/>. Thankfully, you don't have anything like that right now. It seems to me like this is a localised allergic reaction. <UNSURE>However, if</UNSURE> anything changes, if anything deteriorates. Either make an appointment with us, or go straight to A and E. Um, uh, and in some cases, if it's, if it's, uh, progressing rapidly, it's better to go straight to A and E, rather than to, wait for a booked appointment with us, OK. What I'd like you to do now, is I'd like you to try and take some antihistamines. So you can buy <UNSURE>them over the</UNSURE> counter. You can get Piriton or Chlorphenamine, and you can take one tablet, four milligrams, um, up to about six times a day. OK. Or you can just take a one-a-day one, whichever is your preference, that's, that's absolutely fine, there's no, no issue. That should be enough to control this. Um, if, the redness in your arm spreads, and <UNSURE>you, it</UNSURE> feels hot, or you, you know, you have signs of any localised infection. We may need to think about other treatments, like an antibiotic. And like I said if anything deteriorates, in terms of your breathing, that's urgent and we need to process that, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, action needs to be taken urgently. Did <UNSURE>you have</UNSURE> any other, um, queries or was there anything else that you're worried about? <UNSURE>Yeah, that's, that's over the</UNSURE>, yeah <UNIN/>, over the counter. You don't need to, any chemist, will have it, you don't need a prescription for that. Yeah, it's probably cheaper to buy it over the counter actually, than to get it via prescription. OK. Um, now, um, uh, on the basis of what you've told me, I don't think you need any allergy testing. I think this is just a <UNIN/>, a straightforward localised reaction to a, an insect bite. However, if it was to happen that, you know, this, you're, you're having these kind of reactions on a regular basis or other, <UNIN/>, non-specific rashes. We might need to think about blood testing, I don't think we're at, at that moment yet. OK. So uh, but <UNIN/>, that's something to bear in mind in case this, becomes a recurrent pattern. OK then, so, we'll leave it like that for now, OK. I'm gonna leave a <UNSURE>link</UNSURE> to some information about anaphylactic reactions, just for you to read about it. I don't want you to panic, but just for you to be aware what <UNIN/> symptoms are. If those kind of things happen, get back to us. If you're feeling worried, just have a lower threshold for <UNIN/>, having a chat with us, sometimes a chat is all you need to calm things down. All right then John, OK. Uh, <UNSURE>well</UNSURE> we'll leave it like that, <UNIN/>, come back to us if you have any further issues. My pleasure. All right, take care then. All the best. Bye <UNSURE>bye</UNSURE>.","Hello.

Um, but I, uh, I'm feeling like slightly anxious that, uh, there's a bit of, I've got a bit of a, a rash on my arm where, i got stung. Um, and, I've, kind of.

Uh, yeah sure. Um, it's just, just there. Mm-hmm. It's, it's slightly red, yeah and, and kind of there's, a bit of a, like a hole there, where I think that the wasp, stung me. Uh, <UNIN/>.

And any other symptoms at all? So you mentioned the tummy pain, you mentioned diarrhea, you mentioned the vomiting. Anything else that comes to mind? Okay. Okay, so you're drinking fluids. What kind of foods have you managed to eat, anything? Okay, fine. And so you started three days ago to symptoms. Are you aware of any triggers which may have caused your symptoms to kick on? So for example, things like takeaway foods or eating out or being around other people with similar symptoms? Okay. Do you remember what you ate? Okay. Anyone else unwell with similar symptoms? Okay, okay, fine. Right. And in terms of your overall health, are you normally fitting well? Okay. And is your asthma well controlled? Fine. And you don't have any other tummy problems, bowel problems I should be aware of? No. Okay. Apart from the inhalers, do you take any other medications? Okay, fine. And in terms of just your day-to-day life, you said it's been affecting your life. In what way has it been affecting your life? Okay. Yeah. And are you currently working at the moment? More work. Okay. Have you been going into work the last three days or have you been at home? That must be difficult for you then. Right. And you say you mentioned you live with a wife and two children, is that right? All right. Just a couple of other questions we need to ask. Do you smoke at all? And do you drink much in the way of alcohol? Okay. So normally at this stage I like to examine you if that's okay. But having listened to your stories, I think just to recap, for the last three days you've been having loose stool diarrhea, a bit of tummy pain, mainly on the left-hand side, and vomiting and feeling generally quite weak and lethargic. You mentioned you're having this Chinese takeaway as well three days ago, and I wonder whether that might be the cause of your problems. It seems like you may have something called gastroenteritis, which is essentially just a tummy bug or infection of your tummy, mainly caused by viruses, but it can be a possibility of bacteria causing your symptoms. At this stage, what we'd recommend is just what we say conservative management. So I don't think you need anything like antibiotics. It's really just making sure you're well hydrated. So drinking fluids. There are things like dirolite you can get from the pharmacy, which it helps replenish some of your minerals and vitamins. And if you are having vomiting and diarrhea, I would certainly recommend that in the first couple of days. If you are feeling feverish and weak, taking some paracetamol, two tablets up to four times a day for the first few days can also help. I'll certainly advise you to take some time off work, actually. I know you're quite keen to work. I would say next two to three days as infection clears from your system, just take some time off and rest. If your symptoms haven't got better, you know, in three to four days, I'd like to come back and see you again. Because if it is ongoing, then we have to wonder whether there's something else causing symptoms. And we may need to do further tests like taking a sample of your stool so we can test that, etc., etc. How's that sound? Do you have any questions for me? Okay. Is the treatment plan clear? Great. Well, I wish you all the best. Thank you.","Hello, how are you? Hi, I've just had some diarrhea for the last three days and it's been affecting me.

And you're saying you're drinking lots of water, you're going to the toilet more frequently for a wee? Is that any pain when you pass urine? No stinging. Okay. And sort of no foul-smelling urine or anything like that. You're saying you're going a bit more frequently. Are you having to go with urgency to the toilet for a wee? Okay. All right. So the main symptom is feeling sick with this, you've been feeling bunged up and this sort of pain in your tummy. Just to ask a few more questions about the pain in your tummy, is it how would you describe the pain? Okay. And it's it is it constant or is it coming and going? And just need to ask a few questions about your periods of stuff. Any chance you could be pregnant at the moment? Sexually active at the moment? And in your P, did you say? So your P is slightly red or slightly pink. Okay, so when was your last menstrual period? Okay, so three, four. And did you say, so you're sexually active? Are you using contraception? Okay. And one sexual partner, a regular, regular boyfriend? So just to go back to your symptom of constipation, can I just clarify when was the last time you had a bowel motion? Okay, and do you feel like you are still quite bunged up at the moment? Okay. All right, so you just to sort of confirm your symptoms, you're feeling sort of sick, nauseous, with tummy pain, which is fairly constant. Did the tummy pain come on suddenly or gradually? Okay. So it's come on gradually, has it? Not sudden onset. Okay. And your last menstrual period was just three and a bit weeks ago. But you say you've had a little bit of spotting possibly before in between periods or recently. Okay. But you're expecting your period soon. Sure. Okay. And just to ask a few questions. Do you have any other medical problems that I need to be aware of? Allergic amoxicillin. But no other medical problems that you any drug allergies? Oh, you mentioned the moxicillin, but anything else? And do you take any medications at the moment? Simple and none, yeah, sure. Okay. Do you smoke? Okay. And do you live with alone with your partner? And any other medical, sorry, any diseases running your family? Sure. Okay. Great. So is there anything that you're particularly concerned about with this nausea and the constipation? Yeah. Yeah. Anything that you'd hoped particularly to get out of having this consultation was there anything that you'd hope to get out of having this specific consultation other than a diagnosis and getting better and you know being on the right track to feel better to normal yeah yeah sure sure okay so and then finally I didn't ask you do you have any discharge or anything like that from down below no discharge okay all right so I I think this could be a few different things it could just be simple constipation you mentioned that you were bunged up but you did go yesterday so it's and your your bowel habits that you've been going regularly but you did mention that you were bunged up but there could be a few other things going on I would quite like to see you to do some further to do an examination and to do some some tests as well we need to definitely rule out pregnancy with you and possibly do some other examinations or sort of further tests so would you be happy to actually see a GP face to face soon today ideally yeah are you and you're feeling hot hot and sweaty have you been feeling light-headed at all or like you're going to faint okay all right well we're just sort of tying up running out of time a little bit but I'd really like to see you for some more examination and investigations if in the meantime between now and and me so or a GP seeing you you feel worse in any way you get light-headed you have you develop any symptoms which are concerning to you then I think take them quite seriously and see somebody more urgently if possible okay is that was there anything else that you want to talk about right now I'm glad we've got the ball rolling with this and we can sort of see you again to take this a little bit further okay all right thanks for your time thanks bye","Hello. Good, thank you. How are you? My name's Lizzie Irvine. 23rd of July 1995. Yeah, especially on a Friday. Yeah, just for the last couple of days, I've been feeling really sick in my lower tummy. And I've had a bit of a temperature, so feeling quite like hot and sweaty. And it's yeah, getting really uncomfortable. Yeah, it's more of an ache, so like an ache in my lower tummy. And then I think feeling hot and sweaty, sometimes I think it's sickness, but yeah, a bit of an ache. So yeah, no, just nauseous, no vomiting, yeah, luckily. And it's only been for a couple of days, but yeah. No, so I'm I'm going I'm going to the loo a little bit more often than usual. I drink lots of water, but it does feel like more often. But but yeah, like nothing, nothing too out of the ordinary. And I was, I was a little bit like, I don't know, constipated, I guess, about a week ago, but I'm okay now. No, it was more like I was just a little bit bonged up, and then about a week ago that kind of cleared and I'm normal now. Yes, yeah, I'd say so. I tend to drink a lot of water anyway, but I feel like I'm going to the toilet more pain. No, just seems normal, yeah. No, nothing, nothing I can think of, no. No, there's no urgency. Yeah, no pain or urgency, just yeah, peeing quite frequently, but it's all seeming normal. Yeah, I probably wouldn't have thought of it being linked, but yeah. It's yeah, it's like below my belly button. It's it's aching. It does make me feel nauseous. Yeah, so it's kind of more like a, I guess I can, a dull ache just below the belly button, kind of, yeah, here. It's yeah, it's feeling pretty constant over the last couple of days. I don't know. Probably not. I don't think so. I'm very careful. Yes, yeah. You mentioned about periods. I did notice a bit of, I don't know, it's like not necessarily like spotting, but like in my pee is like a little, I suppose, I think I thought it was my period. It's like a little bit pink. Yeah. But I am kind of like due on my I don't know if that was like yeah, part of it around a month ago, yeah, three and a three and a bit weeks ago. Yeah, I've got the implants. Yeah. Yesterday. No, it seems to have cleared up. So I was about a week ago, but I'm okay. Okay now, the last few days. Yeah, it's been okay. It's only been for the last two days. So I guess, yeah, quite recently. Yeah. No. Yeah, the last kind of week or so. Yeah, the last couple of days, really. But because I was due on, yeah, I think, yeah, just the last couple of days. Yes, yeah. I'm allergic to oxicillin. No, not that I'm aware of. No, that's it. No, no medications, but I'm on the implants. I think it's called Implanon or something. No. With my boyfriend. Not only that spring to mind in my immediate family. My brother is a type one diabetic. I don't know, it's just a really, like, a really horrible ache and a nauseous, hot, sweaty feeling. I'm not really sure why it's happening. The last couple of days, that's probably all that's getting comfortable. Anything, sorry? Yeah, no, that's kind of, I just want to get back to a bit more comfortably. No, no, no discharge. Yes, yeah. Sure, I can make time. No, no, not like I'm going to faint. Yeah, thank you.

To be honest, sometimes I have, when I get a bit of anxiety, I, I use my inhaler. And, but my inhaler kind of um, run out <UNSURE>the</UNSURE> one. Because you know, I'm a foreigner, so I have uh, this brand, but I bought a new one here. And, uh, I don't know maybe this new one has cause it, <UNSURE>this</UNSURE>, this problem. I don't know. <UNSURE>Mmm</UNSURE>. Uh-huh. Um, uh, <UNIN/> I, I always have problems with my breathing, because of the asthma like, <UNIN/>. When I, <UNIN/>, I need to use my inhaler a little bit, but apart of the normal, I haven't, I haven't. <UNIN/>, no, I haven't <UNIN/>, I haven't noticed any chest pain. Uh, walking and talking, uh, yes, yes. Uh, I, I, but uh, but yeah I don't walk very far because uh, I, yeah I need to, I need to go to the toilet now and then. So, I'm spending some time at <UNSURE>home</UNSURE>. Ohh, it does a little bit. Sure. OK. Ohh, OK. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> <UNSURE>Mmm, OK</UNSURE>. Uh-huh. OK. OK, I, <UNSURE>yeah</UNSURE>. OK. I didn't, yeah, sorry I <UNSURE>didn't</UNSURE>. No, I was saying I didn't have any, fever recently. I, I was sweating a little bit <UNSURE>the</UNSURE> last four days, but I, I.

Yeah, that sounds good, that sounds good. OK. Thank you very much doctor, for your time.

Hi, can you hear me? Hi, my name is Dr. Gohill. I'm one of the doctors that works at Babylon. Can I check your name and date of birth, please? Okay. Okay. And are you in a space that's quiet and you're able to talk? So you're 48. And are you able to talk at the moment? Okay. Tell me, it says here you have a you're you're having problems going to the toilet Okay, tell me how you were three days ago before this started. Did you have any medical problems? Okay. Okay. And apart from asthma, do you have anything else? Okay. Okay. So you've you've had the diarrhea for three days and now you're having pain and vomiting. Has the diarrhea been getting better or worse? Okay. Okay. And how often do you go to the toilet? Okay. That must be hard. Have you had to drink more water than normal? An important question. Have you noticed any blood? And you mentioned tummy pain. Can you tell me more about your tummy pain, like where it is and if it goes anywhere? Yeah. Okay. You've been able to eat and drink. And you said the tummy pain's in the middle of your tummy. Does it go anywhere else? Okay. And when was the last time you vomited? Did you have any breakfast? Okay. And that and you vomited that up afterwards. Did you notice any blood when you vomit? Okay. And three days ago, did you eat anything that you think might have been bad or anything that could have caused the tummy pain? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. It's very unlikely for an inhaler to cause tummy pain like this. Normally it's when you eat bad food or food that has gone off and you normally get symptoms like you have suggested. But just to double check, have you noticed any problems with your breathing? Okay. Okay. And how about chest? Have you noticed any chest pain? Okay. And how about walking and talking? Are those all both okay? Yeah. And when you press on your tummy, does it cause any pain? Okay. Sorry, I was just writing some things down. So what it sounds like to me is that you might have eaten something bad and it's causing your tummy pain. And this is normally called gastroenteritis, so an infection of the tummy. Normally, when patients have this, we do three things. Number one is to drink lots of water and fluids because you're losing lots at the moment. Number two is to make sure and look out for any fevers. So if you start getting a temperature, then you need alpha to mole. And three is stay home for the time being until you get slightly better. And normally things like antibiotics don't help. They make the situation worse. So that's go ahead. So I think that's what we should do for the time being. If you feel you're getting much worse, then I would suggest you go and see your GP in real life, in person, so they can look at your belly. Great. Cool. Do you have any more questions for me? Yes. So the things that you've told me are most suggestive of an infection of your tummy and less likely to be something your father had. But if your things don't get worse, then that's something that we can look at from the GP. Does that sound okay? Thank you very much. Bye-bye.","Hello. Hi, hi. I can hear you well. Hi, doctor.

And the other two things that I've just, jotted down. Is, you're feeling hot, but you didn't mention that. Is that <UNSURE>correct</UNSURE>? OK. Yes. So, do you feel short of breath while you're sitting at your desk? <UNIN/>. OK. And, how about when you're exercising? OK. And the last thing is. You mentioned that you noticed your heart beating? Again, how often do you get that? OK. How long has that been happening for? Fine. And, apart from all of these things that you've told me. Do you have any other medical problems? OK. And, do you take medications for that? And, are you remembering to take your medications? OK. And, do you drink or smoke? How much do you drink? <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE>. And, how about smoking? And, uh, I need to ask this to all of my patients, but do you do anything else recreational, in terms of drugs? OK. So, you've never taken cocaine, or marijuana? OK, thank you. And, are you allergic to anything? Good. So, you've told me lots of things happening to you at the moment, and I can understand, they probably feel quite strange and unusual. Um, I think the best course of action is, you come and see, one of our doctors, in the clinic. <UNSURE>We</UNSURE> can give you an examination, and what that means is, we check your heart and your breathing. Make sure that those things are functioning correctly. And probably do some blood tests, for your <UNSURE>thyroxine</UNSURE>. And take it from there. How does that sound? I think before we give you any medications, we should see you in person. So, <UNSURE>what we're</UNSURE> going to do is book an appointment. Or I think you can book an appointment through the app, to come and <UNSURE>see us</UNSURE> <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> clinic, and see one of my colleagues. I'll let them know what you've told me today, so you won't have to repeat exactly what you've said. Great. Do you have any questions? Thank you very much.","Hello. <UNIN/>. Yes, I can hear fine.

No. Yeah. I, I, when I like, it's maybe once a day, uh, maybe more. Uh. There's one more thing that I, I think I should mention, like, I do have like, some loss of libido at home.

So those are lots of things. Are they all happening at the same time? And do they all happen at the same time or is it one thing one time and one another? Okay. So let's start with the headaches. When they do come, do you have any idea the headache is going to come? So it's normally at work. Okay. And where does the headache sit in your head? Is it the front or the back? Okay.

Hi. Good afternoon. Hi, this is Dr. Dean Misler from GP at Hand. Hi. So before we start your appointment, could I please confirm your full name and date of birth? That's great. Thank you. That's great. Thank you for that. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment? Okay. So how can I help you today? Yeah, I'm still here. Okay. And how is your arm right now? So you still can't move. And what time did you wake up? You said it was an hour. Are you sure about that? Okay. Now, can I just double check? Has this ever happened before? Okay. And did you sleep anything in an awkward position or in a different bed or anything like that last night? Okay. And is there any discoloration in your hand? Okay. Does your hand feel cold? Okay. And it's on your left side. Have you had any symptoms in your left leg at all? Right. Okay. And how long has that tingling been there for? Okay. Now, I can't see you. It's a telephone appointment. But have you noticed any kind of asymmetry in your face or did your face expression look different on one side compared to the other or anything different at all? Okay, so you had some difficulty swallowing, is that right? Any problems with your speech? Is your speech different to how it sounds normally? Okay. Is there anyone at home with you? Okay. Well, I'm concerned that some of the symptoms you've got may be symptoms of a stroke. Okay. So that's something that can be dealt with, but it needs to be dealt with as an emergency in a hospital. Yeah, I'm happy to do that. What we need to do is to make sure that they've got access to you when you come. So maybe you could leave the front door unlocked to sit in the hallway. But I'm going to arrange one of my colleagues next to me to call an ambulance to your home address now. That's being done right now as we speak. While we're waiting for that, I'm just going to ask you a few more questions. Is that okay? Okay. Do you have any other illnesses at all? Okay. And are you on any medication for that? Okay. Do you have any allergies to any medication? Okay. Are there any illnesses in your family at all? Okay. Anyone else? And are you normally living alone? Do you smoke at all? Okay. How much alcohol do you drink? So what drinks are we talking about? Okay. All right. How are you feeling now? Have you got the symptoms right now still? Okay, all right. So the ambulance is on its way, all right? And what they're going to do is they'll probably take you down to the local hospital, AE, and they will ring through for the stroke doctor to assess you to see whether they can give you any kind of treatment for that. Okay, so don't worry, they're on their way. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to stay on the line until they reach there just to make sure that you're okay. Not at the moment, no, not at the moment. Just make sure that the front door is open, sit in the hallway by the front door so that they've got access if needs be, if for any reason you can't open the front door, okay? All right, then, so I'm just going to stay on the line and we'll wait until the ambulance comes. Okay, then, all right, thank you.","Hello there. Good afternoon. This is Jack. Hi there.
