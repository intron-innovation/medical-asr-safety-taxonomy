[Speaker 2]: Ok. Doctor i have been experiencing rectal bleeding for the past two weeks and it is gotten worse. Starting off as a little bit of blood in my stool but now there's quite alot of bright red blood mixed in. I have also had change of this in my bowel cavity, going from regular to alternating between my constipation and diarrhea and i have lost some weight unintentionally and i have been feeling really tired lately 

00:36:03
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Giving these symptoms. Can i? I want to start by asking you a few more questions to understand your condition better. First is have you notice any blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet room?

01:02:01
[Speaker 2]: Yes. I definitely notice blood on the toilet paper. Sometimes there's even blood dripping into the toilet after i finished going into the bathroom 

01:16:99
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That a significant amount of bleeding. So i want to investigate on this further. So i want to ask you about your diet. Have you notice any changes in your appetite or the food you're eating? 

01:35:03
[Speaker 2]: To be honest, my appetite has been i little bit up lately. I have been feeling an unusual. I have been having to force myself to eat sometimes. I haven't really made a big changes to my diet though

01:53:02
[Speaker 1]: Ok. So Thank you for sharing this information. I have a few more questions to ask about your medical history and family history and all. First can you tell me about your past medical history including any surgeries or hospitalizations?

02:21:00
[Speaker 2]: I haven't really had any major surgeries or hospitalizations in the past. I have high blood pressure but it is well controlled with medication 

02:33:98
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That's good to hear. And regarding your family history can you tell me about your family history either your mom or your dad?

02:54:03
[Speaker 2]: Regarding my family. My father passed away from colorectal cancer 

03:02:02
[Speaker 1]: Ok

03:04:02
[Speaker 2]: That's about it and my mother has breast cancer about 10 years ago but she's been in remission for several years now. I think other than that I can't think of any other illness or cancers that run in my family 

03:23:98
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. So a family history of cancer especially colorectal cancer and breast cancer can increase your risk for developing certain cancers. But now let's talk about your social history. Do you drink or smoke?

03:55:100
[Speaker 2]: I don't smoke and i quit about 10 years ago but i do drink on occasional events 

04:06:02
[Speaker 1]: That's great. Quiting smoking can be significantly reduce your of developing several types of cancer. Now let's move on to allergies. Do you have known allergies either to medications or other substance?

04:29:99
[Speaker 2]: No. I don't have any known allergies. I have never had any issues with medication or anything else like that 

04:38:01
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. Now based on your symptoms and family history and social history there are few possible conditions that could be causing these symptoms. One possibility as you mentioned is colorectal cancer and other possibility include  inflammatory bowel disease, polyps or hemorrhoids and diverticulosis. To confirm all these conditions i would like to have some test including colonoscopy and blood test 

05:21:00
[Speaker 2]: A colonoscopy sounds a bit intimidating. Can you tell me more about what it involves? And what you expect to find? 

05:33:98
[Speaker 1]: I understand your concern and i may know a colonoscopy is a procedure where a flexible tube and a camera is inserted through the rectum and into the colon. You know, to examine of the large intestine. So it is very common and safe procedure that is used to screen for and diagnosed for colon and rectum condition. So i expect to find the cause of your symptoms whether it is cancer, polyps or something else. So you see during the colonoscopy if we find any polyps or areas of concern, we can remove small samples of the tissue for further examination. This is known as biopsy. We can also take biopsies of any abnormal looking areas in the colon lining. So to sample will then be sent to a lab for analysis to determine if they are cancerous or benign 

06:44:03
[Speaker 2]: What will happen if biopsy result shows that i have cancer doctor?

06:52:02
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Excuse me, if the biopsy results comes back as positive for cancer then we will discuss the best treatment options for you 

07:08:98
[Speaker 2]: Thank you for answering all my questions doctor. I feel a bit more informed now but also more nervous about the possibility of a cancer

07:20:01
[Speaker 1]: I understand how you feel but remember that catching any potential issues early can make a big difference. I am here to support you through this process and i will schedule the test and i will take one step at a time. So please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns 

07:45:02
[Speaker 2]: Thank you. I will be waiting for the test result and i appreciate your help 

07:50:99
[Speaker 1]: You are very much welcome. 

So based on my findings from the symptoms you shared and the information shared from the patient. There's rectal bleeding for two weeks worsening over time and change in bowel habit. There's no significant past medical history, Family history and there's also family history of colorectal and breast cancer. There's no current smoking but occasional alcohol consumption and there are no allergies. So the possible diagnosis includes colorectal cancer which is the most likely based on the symptom, family history and also social history and also the second diagnosis could be inflammatory bowel disease which is known as the IBD which is less likely due to lack of abdominal pain or diarrhea.""

I think, other than that, I can't think of any other illnesses or cancers that run in my family. Okay, thank you for sharing that information. So a family history of cancer, especially cholesterol cancer and breast cancer, can increase your risk for developing certain cancers. But now let's talk about your social history. Do you drink or smoke? I don't smoke. No, I quit about 10 years ago. But I do drink on occasional fronts. Okay, that's great. You know, quitting smoking can be significant, can significantly reduce your risk of developing several types of cancer. Now, let's move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies either to medications or other substance? No, I don't have any non-allergies. I've never had any issues with medications or anything else like that. Okay. Thank you for sharing that information. Now, based on your symptoms and family history and social history, there are a few possible conditions that could be causing these symptoms. One possibility, as you mentioned, is collectoral cancer, and other possibilities include inflammatory bowel disease, polyps or hemorrhoids, and diverticulosis. To confirm or all these conditions, I would like to order some tests, including a colonoscopy and blood test. A colonoscopy sounds a bit intimidating. Can you tell me more about what it involves and what you expect to find? I understand your concern. You know, a colonoscopy is a procedure where a flexible tube with a camera is inserted through the rectum and into the colon, you know, to examine the lining of the large intensity. So it's a very common and safe procedure that is used to screen for and diagnose colon and rectal conditions. So I expect to find the cause of your symptoms, whether it's cancer, polyps, or something else. So you see, during the colonoscopy, if we find any polyps or areas of concern, we can remove small samples of tissue for further examination. This is known as biosports biopsies of any abdominal looking areas in the colon lining. So the samples would then be sent to a lab for analysis to determine if they are cancerous or burning. And what will happen if the biopsy results show that I have cancer, doctor? Okay. Excuse me. If the biosp results come back as positive for cancer, then we will discuss the best treatment options for you. Thank you for answering all my questions, Doctor. I feel a bit more informed now, but also more nervous about the possibility of cancer. I understand how you feel, but remember that catching any potential issues early can make a big difference. I'm here to support you through this process and I will schedule the test and we will take it one step at a time. So please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns. Thank you. I will be waiting for the test results. I appreciate your help. You are very much welcome. So based on my findings from the symptoms shared and the information shared from the patient, there's rectal bleeding for two weeks, worsening over time and change in bowel habits. There's no significant past medical history, family history of, and there is also family history of colorectal and breast cancer. There is no current smoking, but occasional alcohol consumption and there are no allergies. So the possible diagnosis includes cholesterol cancer, which is the most likely based on the symptoms, family history, and also social history. And also, the second diagnosis could be inflammatory bowel disease, which is known as the IBD, which is less likely due to lack of abdominal pain or diarrhea.",
