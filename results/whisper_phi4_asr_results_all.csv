And what have you taken so far for your headache? So I've had some paracetamol and some ibuprofen, but it's not really helping at the moment. okay so just a few more questions with regards to your headache so do you find it difficult to look at the light um no like um it's fine light doesn't seem to bother me too much okay and is there any pain when you try to move your neck from side to side up and down is there any pain um i've got sort of general aching muscles um not necessarily sort of in my neck it's kind of a bit all over really okay all over Right, and have you been sick with this head headache?

No, I mean I've got a bit of a rash but nothing like no no no no bleeding. Okay, so where's the rash? It's rash is kind of all all over my body. How would you describe the rash?

it possible for me to have a look at your elbow now yeah sure ok bear with me one second right ok and if you can just raise your elbow up a little bit like that a bit higher so i can just see the underside ok fantastic all right and then just bring it around to this side essentially i can see the other side okay fantastic all right and if you can just touch the tip of your elbow with your fingers is it is it hot compared to the surrounding skin the adjacent skin it's a bit warm yes it's a bit warmer okay um and um is it very tender when you're pressing on that now if you give it a press does it hurt you at all on the on the tip of the elbow it's it's okay just like next to it like where the the swelling is it's a bit yeah it feels a bit fluid okay all right um well i noticed the skin was a bit dry on the tip of the elbow do you do you have dry skin anywhere else in the body um no not really i have no more skin do you suffer from eczema at all no all right okay so um what i think we should do with regards to your elbow problem okay is um i think it would be worthwhile this seems like what we call the bursitis okay so that's an inflammation of one of the fluid sacks around the joint um what i think we should do is i think you should be on some anti-inflammatory medication in the first instance and as well as that what i would like to do is to get some blood tests done to check for other types of causes of joint swelling okay so um what we're going to do is we're going to arrange some um blood test forms to be sent out to your house and there'll be instructions within that pack about where to go to get those blood tests done and that will involve you um having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers infection rheumatological antibodies so we'll do a full screen and also check for things like gout as well okay okay the time frame for that will be um the results will come back to us after about five six days um from now so it takes time for the forms to come out to you and if you get the form of the test done straight away by the time that we're expecting a result back you know one or two days after that we're looking at maybe six days and what i would suggest is we can arrange a follow-up appointment for you in one of our clinics where we can have a look at your joint feel it we can review the blood tests and we can um get a gauge as to what's going on now in terms of your joint right now it doesn't look like to me like something called excuse me septic arthritis so we are worried sometimes that someone might have an acutely infected joint and your your joint doesn't look like that however if your the elbow was to become very red very painful and the redness was to spread or become you know more intense then you need to get on the phone or have a video with one of us as soon as possible because that would be an emergency that would require more immediate assessment more immediate treatment okay do you do you think it's something dangerous like something like could i die from that or is it no i don't think this is anything dangerous don't need to worry okay what i'm doing is i'm just outlining the worst case scenario if things were to to develop okay so if things were to worsen this this is not the case right now right now it looks quite straightforward nothing's sinister or life threatening um what i'm doing is i'm just saying in case things worsen these are the things that we'd be looking out for and this is what we have to do but you don't have that now thankfully and i don't think you're going to have it but i'm just saying the what if scenario is that okay yeah that sounds good thank you all right did you have any questions that you wanted to ask me um well just yeah i just wanted to know about this yeah it feels a bit better now to know that okay all right yeah no that's it thank you okay so i would take ibuprofen regularly okay you can get that over the counter that's four hundred milligrams two times a day and you should take take that after food not on an empty stomach if you get any heartburn stop taking it okay sure all right so what i want to do is i'll get the form sent out to you and we are going to arrange a follow-up appointment maybe within a actually you know the follow-up appointment doesn't have to be face to face if it's more convenient for you to do it over the phone we can do that over the phone video you can do that as well that's that's your call but you contact us after you've had the blood test done and we can review things then okay okay yeah that sounds good i i'll do that and if i see that it's getting worse i'll probably ask for a physical appointment but sure sure that's good idea all right then okay um take care then so i'll just leave that with me i'll sort out those bits and pieces out and then we'll get them sent out to you and then we'll we'll review you after the test things go well all right all right then take care then all the best bye bye bye あ！"," Hi there, good morning. Hello, good morning. I'm Dr. Dean Mirza from GP at Hand. Nice to see you. Nice to see you. Okay, before we start your appointment, could you please tell me your first name and your date of birth? Yes, my name is John Smith and I was born on the 5th of April 1973. Okay, that's great. Thank you for that. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak freely? Yes, absolutely. Certainly. Okay, that's great. Thank you for that. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak freely? Yes, absolutely. Okay, great. Okay, so tell me a bit about what's been happening. You mentioned in the notes that you've got a problem with your elbow. Yeah, I just noticed this about a week ago or something. I have a weird swelling on my elbow. I noticed that when I was in the shower. It's not painful at all. I feel fine, but it's just a bit weird to see that. It's slightly warm. And I kind of feel like it's a bit fluid inside. I want to sure so i have to know what's going on with it so did you say it was the left elbow or the right elbow um it's the the left elbow left elbow okay and have you banged that elbow did you have any kind of injury no not really um not that i know off i haven't noticed anything. I can actually read normally. I can just see that it feels a bit strange. Sure, okay. And in terms of your job, do you do anything physical? Not really, no. I just sit at the desk. Right. Okay. And has this happened before? No, I haven't noticed that before. I don't have any history of seeing this. I don't remember at all. Sure. Okay. And can I just double check? Has anyone in your family got any kind of rheumatology diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus or anything like that? No. Well, I do. Well, I think I have something like osteoarthritis. It sometimes kind of hurts my joints, but in my family, I'm not sure. Okay. I'm not sure. Sure. So you said you think you've got osteoarthritis has anyone ever told you that have you ever seen a doctor who's confirmed that and told you about osteoarthritis yes yes a few years ago okay was that a GP or a specialist or physiotherapy GP GMP okay all um sorry can i just double check how old you are please i'm 53 53 okay fantastic all right um and do you have any other illnesses at all um well not not really you know um i'm allergic to peanuts and that allergic to any medication I know not that I know of sure and do you are you on any medication on a regular basis and okay and you normally fit and well, mobile, active? I do. I do some sports. I run regularly, like two, three times a week. Yeah, no, I think I'm healthy. Okay, good. Glad to hear that. Well done. That's good that you're doing that on a regular basis. Okay. And can I, is it possible for me to have a look at your elbow now? Yes okay keep it with me one second right okay and if you can just raise your elbow up a little bit like that a bit higher so I can just see the underside okay fantastic all right and then just bring it around to this side essentially I can see other side okay fantastic all right and if you can just touch the tip of the elbow with your fingers does it is it hot compared to the surrounding skin the adjacent skin it's a bit warm yes it's a bit warmer okay um and um is it very tender when you're pressing on that now if you give it press, does it hurt you at all? On the tip of the elbow it's okay, just like next to it, like where the swelling is, it's a bit, yeah, it feels a bit fluid. Okay, alright. I noticed the skin was a bit dry on the tip of the elbow. Do you have dry skin anywhere else in the body? No, not really. I have more skin. Do you suffer from eczema at all? No. All right. Okay, so what I think we should do with regards to your elbow problem is I think it would be worthwhile, this seems like what we call the bursitis, okay, so that's an inflammation of one of the fluid sacs around the joint. What I think we should do is, I think you should be on some anti-inflammatory medication in the first instance, and as well as that, what I would like to do is to get some blood tests done to check for other types of causes of joint swelling okay so what we're going to do is we're going to arrange some blood test forms to be sent out to your house and there'll be instructions within that pack about where to go to get those blood tests done and that will involve you having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers, infection, rheumatological antibodies, so we'll do a full screen and also check for things like gout as well. The time frame for that will be, the results will come back to us after about five six days from now, it takes time for the forms to come out to you. And if you get the forms, the test comes straight away. By the time that we're expecting a result back, one or two days after that, we're looking at maybe six days. And what I would suggest is we can arrange a follow-up appointment for you in one of our clinics where we can have a look at your joint, feel it, we can review the blood tests and we can get a gauge as to what's going on. Now in terms of your joint right now, it doesn't look like to me like something called, excuse me, septic arthritis. So we are worried sometimes that someone might have an acutely infected joint and your joint doesn't look like that. However, if the elbow was to become very red, very painful, and the redness was to spread or become more intense, then you need to get on the phone or have a video appointment with one of us as soon as possible, because that would be an emergency. That more immediate assessment more immediate treatment okay do you think it's something dangerous like something like could i take from that or is it no i i don't think this is anything dangerous i don't need to worry okay what i'm doing is i'm just outlining the worst case scenario if things were to develop okay so? So if things were to worsen, this is not the case right now. Right now, it looks quite straightforward. Nothing's sinister or life-threatening. What I'm doing is I'm just saying, in case things worsen, these are the things that we'd be looking out for. And this is what we have to do. But you don't have that now, thankfully. And I don't think you're going to have it. But I'm just saying the what-if scenario. Is that OK? Yeah that okay yeah that that sounds good thank you all right did you have any questions that you wanted to ask me well just yeah I just wanted to know about this it feels a bit better now to know that okay all right yeah no that's it thank you okay so I would take ibfen regularly. Okay, you can get that over the counter That's 400 milligrams two times a day And you should take take that after food not an empty stomach if you get any heartburn stop taking it. Okay, sure all right, so what I want to do is I'll get the form sent out to you and We are going to arrange a follow-up appointment Maybe within a Actually, you know the phone doesn't have to be face-to-face It's more community to do over the phone we can do that with a video you can do that That's your call, but you contact us after you've had the blood test done or we can review things down. Okay? Okay? Yeah, that sounds good I'll do that. If I see that it's getting worse. I'll probably ask for a physical appointment. Sure, that's a good idea. Alright then. Take care then. Just leave that with me. I'll sort all those bits and pieces out and we'll get them sent out to you and then we'll review you after the test. Alright then. Take care. All the best. Bye bye."

Yeah, it doesn't feel like yeah, I just make me feel weak I haven't had a fever at the moment, but I did notice a temperature when the symptoms started so Yeah around about three or four days ago. You measure your temperature then? Yeah, I didn't measure my temperature no but I felt just a bit hot. Okay okay any other symptoms like sweating or no and any vomiting at all? Yeah so I vomited at the start of the symptoms but now I've stopped vomiting. You've stopped vomiting okay and was your vomit, I know it's not nice to talk about, but was it just normal food colour? Yeah, yeah, just normal vomit, yeah. And there was no blood in your vomit, is that right? No blood, no. No, okay. Yeah. And any other symptoms at all? So you mentioned tummy pain, you mentioned diarrhoea, you mentioned your vomiting. Yeah. Anything else that comes to mind? I had a loss a loss of appetite I haven't been eating as much but I've been able to hold down fluids okay so you're drinking fluids what kind of foods have you managed to eat anything I'm just soups and yeah light foods like smoothies and yeah liquid foods mainly okay fine and so these dollars three days ago to symptoms are you aware of any triggers which may have caused symptoms to kick on so for example things like takeaway foods or eating out or beating around other people who would similar symptoms yeah so I had takeaway about four days ago but other than that I've yeah been eating normally I think unusual yeah. Do you remember what you ate? Yeah I ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends. Okay anyone else unwell with similar symptoms? So no one else in the family, so I have a wife and two kids and one child was vomiting but they haven't got diarrhea so no one with the same symptoms. Right and in terms of your overall health are you normally fit and well? Yeah I mean other than asthma my use an inhaler everything else is fine okay and did you ask my well controlled yeah that's fine I just yeah you send inhaler and that's under control and you don't have any other tummy problem bowel problems I should be aware of? No. Okay and apart from the inhalers, do you take any other medications? No, no other medications. Okay fine. In terms of just your day-to-day life, you said it's been affecting your life. Yeah. In what way has it been affecting your life? So I need to stay close to the toilet because I go quite frequently during these past three days. Okay. Yeah, other than that, it's the main concern. And are you currently working at the moment? Yes, yeah, I work. What do you do for work? I'm an accountant. Okay. Have you been going to work the last three days or have you been at home? Yeah, I've going to work. Okay that must be difficult for you then? Yeah it's been quite difficult. Right and you say you mentioned you live with a wife and two children is that right? Yes yeah. All right just a couple of other questions we need to ask, do you smoke at all? No I don't smoke. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol? No I don't drink alcohol no. okay so um, normally at this stage I like to examine you if that's okay, but having listened to your stories, I think, just to recap, for the last three days you've been having loose stool, diarrhea, a bit of tummy pain mainly on the left-hand side, vomiting, and being generally quite weak and lethargic. You mentioned you were having this Chinese takeaway as well three days days ago and I wonder whether that might be the cause of your problems. Okay. It seems like you may have something called gastroenteritis which is essentially just a tummy bug or infection of your of your tummy mainly caused by viruses but it can be a possibility of bacteria causing your symptoms. At this stage what we'd recommend is just what we say conservative management. So I don't think you need anything like antibiotics. It's really just making sure you're well hydrated, so drinking fluids. There are things like dirolyte you can get from the pharmacy which helps replenish some of your minerals and vitamins. Okay. And if you are having vomiting and diarrhea I would recommend that in the first couple of days. Yeah. If you are feeling feverish and weak, taking some paracetamol, a few tablets up to four times a day for the first few days can also help. I would certainly advise you to take some time off work actually, I know you're quite keen to work, I would say next two to three days, get some clear from your system, take some time off and rest. If your symptoms haven't got better, you know, in three to four days, I'd like to come back and see you again. Okay, sure. Because if it is ongoing, then we have to wonder whether there's something else causing symptoms. And we may need to do further tests, like taking a sample of your stool so we can test that, etc. Yeah, sure. How's that sound? That sounds great, yeah. Do you have any questions for me? No, no further questions. Is the treatment plan clear? Yeah, that's very clear, thank you. Great, well I wish you all the best. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Bye."

They checked my diabetes, my blood pressure and my cholesterol and the doctor said it was all okay. Fantastic. Okay. Now, do you have any other illnesses at all? No. Are you on any medication? I take an aspirin, 75 milligrams once a day, but that's because of something I read on the internet. Okay Okay so why is that? Why do you take that? I think it's meant to reduce your risk of stroke and heart attack. Okay have you ever told a doctor before your GP that you're on aspirin? Yes I took I started taking it after my father had his operation but that wasn't the doctor telling me okay and has any gp ever spoken to you about the risks of aspirin whether you should be on it or have you not told the gp in the past no i haven't okay um all right um now um in terms of your uh your kind of social situation are you working at the moment yes i am what. What do you work as? I'm actually a doctor. You're a medical doctor? Yes. Okay, which specialty are you in? I work in plastic surgery. Plastic surgery, okay great.

Right. Okay. That's fine. Now, obviously you're a medic yourself. Did you have any thoughts as to what might be going on? I've absolutely got no idea. Right, okay. Well, the way you're describing these episodes, they make me concerned about mini strokes or TIAs, transient ischemic attacks. And so that's something quite urgent. And given that you've got a family history of stroke, even though you're quite young, I think it's something that we need to exclude. So what I'm probably going to do, in fact, what I am going to do, is I'm going to refer you to a stroke TIA clinic. Now just to double check, do you have the symptoms right now? No, I'm perfectly fine at the moment. Okay. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to refer you to a mini stroke clinic or a TIA clinic. I send that referral off now and then you can attend them. They'll usually call you in within the next one or two days, okay, because it's something relatively urgent now today it's Wednesday so we've got a few days to pull the weekend so basically the deadline should be Thursday Friday we're expecting to be seen by that time that's the kind of turnaround we're looking at and in that clinic they'll be doing a number of things they'll be checking they'll be doing the ultrasound of the carotid arteries like your father father had and they'll be doing, maybe they might do a scan of the brain as well to show that there's any signs of a bleed there, but they'll be doing a range of tests in a short timeframe in order to exclude whether you have any illness, you haven't got any kind of stroke or mini stroke. Now if your symptoms return and they persist, they're prolonged, then you may need to attend A&E, okay, because our presumptive working diagnosis is mini stroke or TIA, okay, and if a mini stroke is prolonged then we end up thinking that this might be a stroke and in that case that becomes even more of an emergency so we're not talking about waiting one or two days we want you to go to hospital in that instance possible okay sure now if things happen again feel free to contact us we can assess you over the phone we can give you direction and guidance over the time that's that's not the problem you know you've got easy access to us okay so this is the plan going forward I I'm going to do that referral. You should hear back from the hospital relatively soon. The hospital, you can actually ring them on the PALS number and there's also the GIA clinic number. I'm going to leave that number in the notes for this consultation. Okay, so you have all the information you need to chase this appointment and if you want you can ring them either today or tomorrow morning, today in the afternoon, wait one or two hours or tomorrow morning just to find out when they plan to slot you in and just to make sure they've got you in the system, that they've got your books and they're going to be calling you in. This isn't an immediate emergency that you need to rush down to any but it's something quite urgent that we need to deal with in a short space of time, okay? So if there's any delay that transpires, for example, you can't make the appointment or, you know, you don't get called, something needs to be done. You need to get in contact back with us, okay? Great. All right. Did you have any questions at all? No, I think that covers most of it. Okay, great.

And then once I had this really bad UTI, they thought it was kidney stones, and so they had me actually in ER. And if my GP didn't call them, tell them that, you know, they don't need to give me morphine, that was kind of an awful experience. But other than that, you know, I'm pretty good. Okay. Do you take any other medications apart from the ones you told me about well i'll take uh i take vitamin d uh i take melatonin sometimes you know just for cramps i'll take like uh um ibuprofen or actually a sit and i'll take what am i taking a leave whatever i leave is i think that's maybe um acetaminophen or i can't remember what class of drugs you know occasionally if I'm really having hard times like I'll sleeping I'll take Xanax but I prefer melatonin it's just sometimes melatonin doesn't work okay and any problems of your stomach or asthma indigestion no problems and what I would suggest is definitely carrying on with the ice therapy that you've been using so as much as you can because that really does make a difference to injuries bring the healing blood into the area and it gives it the best chance of getting better so as much as you can use the ice and obviously you're trying to stick to a marathon programme but I would try and ease up on the running if you can and if it's painful enough that you're having to stop running then it's not a good idea to do that. It's fine to take the Ibuprofen. I can prescribe you a slightly stronger anti-inflammatory that you can take regularly instead of the ibuprofen, but not with the ibuprofen, but make sure you take that with food. Ultimately, we probably need to examine the knee. So the best thing I would suggest getting an appointment with a physiotherapist first. You can do like a long assessment and examination of the knee and then make an assessment as to whether we need to do any imagery to have a look inside the knee and see if there's any problem with the cartilage well you know I read I read some stuff online that that maybe like my ligaments there's I think it's like ACL or something like that right and so if that I mean I'm kind of like freaked out that they may break. So do you think it's like ACL or something like that, right? And so if that, I mean, I'm kind of like freaked out that the inmate break. So do you think it's that or? It's not really possible to diagnose that over the video. So we definitely would need to see you. The physio is the best point of call because they'll probably be the most initial treatment. But certainly if the appointment time is too long to we can see we can see you as well can you sorry you send referral for that yeah if we can find all that if in the meantime you develop like persistent swelling heat redness and if the knee or high temperature feel unwell or it completely locks up and you can't bend and stretch it, then you'd need to see a doctor urgently. So call us back in that case. That sounds good. Thank you. Yeah, please. Sure. I mean, give me the stronger meds and I'll give that a try. Okay. I'll send it through to your pharmacy for you. Okay. Sweet. Thanks so much. Bye. Bye. Bye."

Well, it certainly sounds like you've had this cold, you've got wheezy with a cough, and it's non-productive cough, and you're short of breath worse at nighttime I mean it gets a little bit worse tonight but basically just pretty consistent yeah I've gone away you've got this tight tight chest but you even say you've got chest pain there's more tight chest is it no not really pain it's more like tight it just feels like sometimes i can't get a full breath in you know yeah sure um okay well i i would quite like to uh certainly get you some uh ventolin clean or modulate have you had asthma exacerbations in the past not in a long time when i was young a little bit more like back in high school but I've been pretty good at taking my met my inhalers so not not so much anymore have you ever been to hospital as an inpatient as in you know stayed in there overnight for asthma yeah when I was in high school I had to have a tube put down my throat oh okay so you say so you you have you went to hospital and had a so you stayed in hospital for a few days did you with an asthma exacerbation yeah yeah okay but currently you're just on ventolin and clino and you haven't got any of those steroids I'd be pretty good I'd be pretty good just on the clenil and the salbutamol Okay, sorry how old were you when you had that severe asthma exacerbation? I think I was like 17 16 maybe Sure Okay Just to quantify how short of breath you are I don't suppose you've got a peak flow with you no you won't have are you able to like walk up flight of stairs okay walk on the flat okay without getting too short breath or are you short of breath of rest i'm definitely not short of breath at rest like except for that that feeling I was describing. It does, when I'm walking upstairs, I do feel like I have a little bit more short of breath than I would normally be. Sure. Yeah, okay, but you're not short of breath at rest at the moment? No, no, no, I'm not. Okay, fine. So what I think, and just to go over, is there anything you'd hoped about getting other than the a prescription for your inhalers was there anything else that you'd hoped about getting on this I just want to know that I'm okay so just like keep I just don't want to have to get that that intubation again sure yeah absolutely well I'm really glad you spoke to me today I think what we can do is is give a prescription for some more of the inhalers. We can get that to you within the hour I would hope and I think the other thing I'd like to do is just give you a dose of steroids. So these are tablets which you can take for five days, two tablets in the morning and That should just dampen down your asthmatic response. Okay, okay Now there are some side effects to the steroids which I should really tell you about but please read the label It's associated. Don't be too worried about the side effects They're uncommon most you know most the time the steroids are very well tolerated and You probably, have you had them in the past? Do you know of? Sorry, sorry, you were cutting in and out a little bit there. What were you saying? Have you had steroids in the past? I can't remember, probably. Probably, yeah. I would like to know. So they can come, they can make you, your mood change, can be slightly low or slightly high. Can give you a high blood sugar. And they can also cause rash and nausea, headaches. But mostly, it's well-tolerated, and it should help your asthma an awful lot. What I like to do is send you some prescriptions for your inhalers are ongoing. So you can, once you get better from this asthma attack, you can use the Clinomodulate in the morning with Ventolin as a PRN, so a Ventolin when you need to, when you're getting if you should start to use the Ventolin more than every three hours at any time it's a good idea to seek medical attention, so see a doctor in some capacity. And the other thing I'd like to send you is a spacer which would allow the medication to actually actually go into your lungs better. Have you do you know what space is have you used one before? Yeah, yeah, I somebody taught me how to use it on a while ago. I don't I don't really use it to be honest, but have you got one I Think I do I have one somewhere, okay. All right. Well, I'll send you another one and it has some instructions about how to use it, but essentially a couple of puffs to prime it inside, breathing in and out for five or ten breaths. Okay. Yeah. So, was there anything else that was on your mind or you're concerned about at this stage? I think you got me covered. Okay. And I might give you some time off work as well. You can self-certify for seven days, but I think I would advise you just to rest a little bit until you're feeling a bit better, if you're okay with that. Thank you. All right. Alrighty, well thank you very much. No worries, any deterioration in your symptoms, like worsening shortness of breath, or just generally concerning symptoms, pain in your chest, tightness, feeling lightheaded, then seek further medical attention anytime, please. Okay? All right, sounds good. Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you, bye-bye. Bye-bye."

Not so much on the one side it tends to be a bit of a cluster at the front of my head in a way um but this time it's just kind of more prominent on the left side which i've never really had it normally they kind of spread across the front of my head okay all right and um can i just double check do you have any neck stiffness at all No. Okay. And do you have any fever? No. All right. How are you with bright lights at the moment? Do you feel sensitive to bright lights or can you tolerate them more? Okay I'm a little bit sensitive it just it kind of makes my eyes a little bit sore but nothing that I can't really handle. Okay and can I just double check are you feeling nauseous at all? Not really like when I first got up this morning my head felt a bit dizzy but that's kind of subsided now and I seems to be fine. Okay and can I just double check does anyone in your family have any migraines or have they been diagnosed with migraines? No, I haven't. Okay. And are you under any particular stress at the moment? Work's kind of a bit stressful in the moment, I've got a lot going on and yeah I just seem to have like a lot of kind of a backlog of work that I need to go through at the moment so I've kind of been doing a lot of late nights as well. Right okay and how long has that been the case for? Probably about a couple of months now. How would you say your mood is? I'm not like moody, I'm not angry or I get a bit frustrated during the day but it kind of ebbs and flows every now and then but yeah. Okay, have you ever been diagnosed with anxiety or depression or stress in the past? I've had, so I had like anxiety for about two years now and I've been on Sertraline for a while. Okay, are you taking Sertraline at the moment? Thank you. anxiety for about two years now and I've been on search relief for a while. Are you taking search relief at the moment? Yes. Okay and how do you feel in terms of anxiety at the moment? Do you feel anxious at the moment? No not necessarily at work sometimes I do feel a bit anxious I kind of just the panic of not being able to get my work done on time. But other than that, I don't feel massively anxious. All right. Now, sorry to ask this, just need to ask this for anyone suffering from angliosis. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or hurting yourself? No. Good. Now, with regards to this headache, is it worse when you lie down or is it better when you lie down? When I lay down, like it kind of feels a little bit sore at first and it takes me a while to get comfortable. So yeah, at the beginning it does, but then again, that just kind of soothes a little bit. Okay. So would you say ultimately it's better when you lie down? Or would you not? Yeah, I would say so. Okay. And in terms of this headache since this morning, have you taken anything for it yet? I've taken some paracetamol. Does that help? Not really, no. Okay, taken anything else at all? No, that's it, just paracetamol. Okay, do you have any other illnesses at all? None. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure? No. Have you ever had your blood pressure checked? No. Okay and are there any illnesses in your family? No there's nothing, my parents, my mum's had a history of anxiety as well but no kind of like physical illnesses or anything like that. Okay all right and are you on medication? No, other than sertraline and having taken paracetamol this morning, nothing else. Do you have any allergies to any medication? Not that I'm aware of, no. Alright. And are you living by yourself at the moment or are you living with someone else? I live with my partner. Okay are you a smoker? No. Okay and do you have any pets at home? I have a cat. Okay and can I just double check how much exercise would you do normally a week? So normally I'd try to go running at least three times a week. Okay and what's your diet like? It's okay, it's nothing really healthy but it's fine. Okay. I wish I was healthy. All right, now in terms of this headache, obviously I haven't been able to examine you or see you directly but it sounds like it might be one of two things it could be an element of what we call tension headache okay that's one possibility and what makes that more likely is the fact that you've been under some pressure and you have a history of anxiety in the past okay the other possibility is migraine as well okay and the fact what makes that more likely is the fact it's on one side and that you've got some sensitivity to light. Okay. So what I think we can do is, I think we can give you some generic pain relief that would be the appropriate first step for migraine type headaches. Okay. So I'll tell you what it is in a second. And the other thing that I was going to suggest is we maybe look, explore things to try and decrease the stress from work. So the medication wise, the things that would start off first line, if someone had migraine would be to start ibuprofen and that the doses of ibuprofen can be a bit more than the normal doses of ibuprofen. So that's one thing we can start. You can keep on taking paracetamol as well if you like, but the ibuprofen is actually more effective for migraine. Oh, right. Yeah, so the guidelines have changed. Before that, we used to give paracetamol as the first line, but now it's ibuprofen or aspirin. That's the first thing. The other thing I'd like you to do is maybe consider taking some time off work okay because if they're due to stress from work maybe having a week off if you self certify that might help with things and I'd also like you to explore counseling options as well so there's a counseling service in your area I can give you the link for you to self refer a lot yeah that okay let's be great. Okay, I'd like to try that. What we're going to do is we'll have a follow-up in a week's time. As well as those two things, other things I'd like you to do is to try and ensure that you're having a minimum of seven, eight hours sleep at night, every night. Okay. A minimum of 1.5 to 2 liters of water or fluids a day. And that's not including coffee or tea. Okay. All right? Because sometimes dehydration and fatigue can be cause of headaches as well I didn't really like that so that is you know all those things up let's let's try that okay let's have a follow-up appointment if we're finding that things are not getting better we might need to arrange some blood tests or look at other possibilities. But we'll try that in the first instance. If anything changes in the meantime, or you get worried or things get worse, feel free, have a low threshold for ringing us back and booking an appointment, and we can reassess the situation. Okay, yeah, that sounds brilliant. Thank you so much for your help. Okay, no problem. So there'll be a summary of all of this in the notes, and I'll also leave a link to some of the danger signs and symptoms of headaches in the notes. If you can read through that in your own time, that will just help you to have a bit more control over what's going on and understanding of what kind of things should trigger you contacting another doctor. Okay, that's perfect. Thank you so much for your help. No problem. Okay, so we'll touch base in a week's time with me, myself, or one of the other doctors and we'll take it from there, okay? Okay, thank you. Yeah, I'll book an appointment in that time. Brilliant. Okay, then. All right. Take care then. Thank you, Angie. Bye-bye. Bye."

I have NKDA allergy. I don't know if it's because of inhaler. And apart from asthma, do you have anything else anything else I don't know maybe it's well because you know it's this thing here in the stomach stuff I always have in the back of my head of my father because he died about 10 years ago of cancer. Okay. So yeah, this is kind of my worries. I don't know. So you've had the diarrhea for three days and now you're having pain and vomiting? Yes, yes. Has the diarrhea been getting better or worse? I think it's not getting better or worse, it's kind of like normal. It hasn't gone away, it hasn't worsened. And how often do you go to the toilet?

So the pain is mainly focused in the center area of the abdomen, like under the belly, under the belly button. And sometimes I can hear my stomach, like the cramps. You've been able to eat and drink? Yes, but I go to the toilet so often, so I try not to eat a lot because I just go to the toilet every 10 minutes. And you said the tummy pain is in the middle of your tummy. Does it go anywhere else? No, no, just there. And it seems to be alleviated by the toilet and maybe it's like gas, I don't know what it is. Okay, and when was the last time you vomited? I think it was this morning, this morning. But the thing is because I'm not eating anything now, so I haven't vomited again. Did you have any breakfast? I don't know. I didn't. No, sorry, yes, I did actually. I did. I had some fruit. And you vomited that afterwards? And afterwards I didn't have anything. Then I got a bit of nausea and I vomited and then that was it. And I haven't eaten since then, so now I think I'm okay. Did you notice any blood when you vomited? I think I do, this no no actually I can't say sorry I'm sorry I don't think there is blood because yeah it was a strawberry that I was having for breakfast so yeah it wasn't blood. Okay and did you eat anything that you think might have been bad or anything that could have caused the tummy pain? I don't know. To be honest, sometimes when I get a bit of anxiety, I use my inhaler. Yeah. But my inhaler kind of ran out the one because, you know, I'm a foreigner. So I have this brand, but I bought a new one here. here okay and I don't know maybe this new one has caused it okay it's problem I don't know okay it's very unlikely for an inhaler to cause tummy pain like this normally it's when you eat bad food or food that has gone off and you normally get symptoms like you have suggested but just double-check have you noticed any problems with your breathing I always have problems with my breathing because of the asthma like when I take shot I need to use my inhaler a little bit but apart from the normal i haven't i haven't okay and how about chest have you noticed any chest pain no i haven't i haven't noticed any chest pain okay and how about um walking and talking are those all both okay uh walking and talking I mean, yes, yes, but I don't walk very far because I yeah I need to I need to go to the toilet now and then so I'm spending some time at home and when you press on your tummy does it cause any pain oh it does a little bit okay sorry I I was just writing some things down. So what it sounds like to me is that you might have eaten something bad and it's causing your tummy pain. Okay. And it's normal, this is normally called gastroenteritis. So an infection over the tummy. Okay. Normally, when patients have this, do four things things number one is to drink lots of water and fluids because you're losing lots at the moment number two is to make sure and look out for any fevers so if you start getting a temperature then you need to eat them all And number three is stay home for the time being until you get slightly better. Okay. And normally things like antibiotics don't help. They make the situation worse. Okay. So that's... Go ahead. No, I was saying I didn't have any fever recently. I was sweating a little bit last for bed, but I'm not sure if I had a bit of fever, but very little. But I don't think so. I don't think. I don't know. Maybe. So I think that's what we should do for the time being. If you feel you're getting much worse, then I would suggest you go and see your GP in real life, in person, so they can look at your belly. OK, I will book then. I will wait a couple of days to see, or one more day, and then I will book. Great. Yeah. Cool. Do you have any more questions for me? No, that's it. I was maybe just concerned about my father's medical history. That would add some kind of risk. So the things that you've told me are most suggestive of an infection of your tummy and less likely to be something your father had but if your things don't get worse then that's something that we can look up from the gp okay does that sound okay yeah that sounds good that sounds good thank you thank you very much doctor bye-bye"

Good morning Kim. How can I help you this morning? So I'm feeling some pain in my tummy, like the lower part of my tummy. Okay. And I'm just feeling quite hot and sweaty. Right, I'm sorry to hear that. When did your symptoms all start? About two days ago. Okay, and where about in your tummy is the pain exactly? Like below my belly button, it's like quite sore when I press on it. Okay, did the pain come on quite suddenly or was it more gradual but so it hasn't been it's more gradual and it's just it's getting a bit worse now okay okay and can you describe the pain to me uh it's kind of like a i guess a burning pain uh and it's just right there in that spot like that's mostly where I'm feeling it it hasn't spread anything else. Just below your belly button you mentioned? Yeah. Okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go? It's really constant it's like getting worse it's not like I can still move and walk around. I mean, I'm still kind of functioning. It's just I'm aware of it all the time. Okay. And with the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms at all? So for example, let's focus first on your bowels. Are your bowels working okay? Yeah, I had a bit of constipation, but that's better now. That was like since last week. Okay so you've got no other symptoms like diarrhea or loose stools? No my bowel movements are normal now. Okay and what about your waterworks are you passing urine okay? Yeah that's fine that I did notice that I was a little the urine was a little pink in color but I haven't like it hasn't really been burning specifically or hurting when I pee and and I did notice I was going to the I was peeing more regularly but I have been drinking lots of fluids so I wasn't sure I wasn't sure you know if that was related to the pain when you mentioned pink urine do you with any blood at all in urine or is it difficult to say. I can't say. I mean, I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. can't say, I mean maybe. Okay, alright, but otherwise it doesn't hurt or sting when you pass urine? I haven't noticed that it really burns or anything like that, just that I'm peeing more than often, more regularly. Okay. And moving up towards other symptoms, have you noticed any vomiting or feeling nauseous at all? Just a little nauseous, but no vomiting. No vomiting. Any temperatures or fevers? I felt a bit hot and sweaty, but I haven't really measured measured it so I can't really say. Okay, fine. And Kim, do you have to ask all female patients, this is a question about your cycle if you don't mind me asking. Are you currently sexually active? Yeah, I've had the same partner. We were last sexually active about four days ago. My last STD screen was normal which was about six months ago. Okay, so you've had no other partner since then? No other partner since then. Okay, and do you use any contraception at all? On the Implanon, I had the Implanon inserted about a year ago. Okay fine. Are you still having periods? Yes. When was your last period? My last period was about three weeks ago, I mean two weeks ago. Two weeks ago, okay. So is it any chance you could be pregnant? I know you've got an implement in bed, is there any chance you could potentially be pregnant? Is there something for us to think about potentially? Well, we don't use any other barrier methods, so we just use the, I just have the Implanon and the SAM partner. Theoretically if the Implanon hasn't been working then I could be pregnant, but I don't suspect. Okay, well something for us to think about, maybe we'll have to do a pregnancy test later on just to confirm that. okay and and so just to summarize so far if you don't mind it's really for the last couple of days this tummy pain has really affected you mainly lower down towards your belly button it's quite burning you said it's getting worse um you notice some pink urine um but no burning or stinging pain when you pass urine your bowels are working okay you felt a little bit nauseous and feeling hot and sweaty. Have I got that all right? Yeah, that sounds very accurate. Is there anything else perhaps you feel like you should share with me at this stage which you think might be important? I don't think so. I think we've covered everything that's really bothering me. Yeah, okay. Tell me a about your medical history otherwise are you normally fitting well? Yeah quite well I haven't had any surgical I don't have any surgical history I don't have any previous I haven't had any operations before or and I'm not on any other medication I just had the implant. Okay have you had anything anything like this before in the past, any similar symptoms? I've never had these symptoms before. No, okay. Fine, any other family history I should be aware of, anything relevant family related to the bowels, maybe related to gynae history? No, not that I'm aware of. Okay, all right. And socially, just tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's at home with you? I live in a share house and with two other roommates. Okay, and are you currently working? Yeah, I am currently working. What do you do for work? I am an accountant. Okay. Grace, okay. Do you smoke at all, Kim? No. No, and do you drink much in the way of alcohol? Socially I drink, but I don't think more than normal. No, okay. But you can understand it. Okay. Just before I go to examination, I just want to go through just a few screening questions, but okay, yes or no. We've covered the majority of them already, but just want to make sure I'm not missing anything else. How's your how's your chest how's your breathing? I don't feel short of breath or I'm not having any problems or I don't have a cough or anything that's worrying me. Okay any funny heartbeats or rhythms palpitations? Not that, no. Okay any headaches any problems with your vision no no okay all right um fine okay um so really just um moving on um so basically based on your story really uh kim it's it's a it's difficult one it's it's um we know you've got some primary pain we don't exactly know what's causing it could be a few different things that keep causing your pain Thank you. Kim, it's a difficult one. We know you've got some primary pain. We don't exactly know what's causing it. It could be a few different things that could be causing your pain. It could just be a urine infection, for example. It could just be something related to your gut. Could this be something related to your, you know, a pregnancy-related cause. And so it's probably worth doing some tests initially to try and rule out what's going on here which I can organize for you today and the base on those tests we will have a better idea in terms of how we should proceed but certainly if it's been going on for the last couple of days you know it's probably maybe worth empirically treating you for maybe a urine infection. Can we do that instead of me going for tests and then seeing how that goes? Yeah, absolutely. So I think it's certainly worth, you know, covering you with some antibiotics today. But I still want you to bear in mind, you you know having a pregnancy test done to make sure we're not missing anything else here and um and i want to kind of really come back and see him in a few days time if your symptoms are not getting any better or indeed they're getting worse so things to look out for would be you know worse than tummy pain um if you're feeling really hot and sweaty the temperatures not coming down vomiting etc that makes sense okay you can try just regular painkillers paracetamol will be advisable make sure you drink plenty of fluids you can try some cranberry as well, which can sometimes help with your urine symptoms Take the antibiotics and give me a call if you are worried about anything else That sounds great, thank you very much Just collect the script at my pharmacy. Yeah, I'll send it straight to your pharmacy. Start the antibiotics today something called trimethoprine We'll take two tablets one tablet twice a day for three days let's hear you get on okay thank you very much great all the best right"

And what that means is we check your heart and your breathing Yeah, make sure that those things are functioning correctly. Yeah, and probably do some blood tests for your thyroxine Yeah, and take it from there. How does that sound? That sounds very good. Thank you. I think before we give you any medications we should see you in person Okay, so I'm going to do is book an appointment or I think you can book an appointment through the app to come and see the clinic and see one of my colleagues.

No, I feel, you know, generally tired. Yeah, but not, not anything special with my chest. Any pain in your chest? No, not that either. Okay, you mentioned feeling tired. Have you felt feverish at all, have you got a temperature? I've been having like, like shivers, even when I'm in, when I'm in bed. You know, like when you, when you go to sleep. and and you feel like i i should be warm but i'm still still you know shivering a little bit but i haven't seen my temperature so i'm not a hundred percent sure if i had a fever but it feels like i probably did because i was just i was next to my boyfriend and he was completely warm and totally fine and i just like couldn't stop shivering and kept adding more sweaters on and i was still cold i don't know okay okay all right um and in terms of any other symptoms so have you had any nausea have you had any vomiting No no no nausea no vomiting like um yeah no nothing like that how's your appetite um i mean it's okay i at the beginning like when i was starting to have the s the coughing and stuff um i had a little bit of diarrhoea um but but i didn't it didn't cut my appetite or anything i just like my stomach wasn't feeling great okay has i got better now the diarrhoea yeah yeah it got better it was only like the first like it started at the same time as the cough started and then it stopped so i thought everything would be fine but then the coughs just kept going okay fine um any problems with your waterworks at all with my what your your waterworks your urine oh no no no that's fine passing urine okay you're drinking plenty of fluids and passing urine okay no i drank loads of water when i started having the diarrhoea and now that it's stopped i just back to normal okay alright um in terms of any other thing do you notice any any funny skin rashes or um problems with your muscles or joints like my you know when i was telling you i had like the i had chills and i was really cold my muscle was really hurting okay to be honest all i feel like doing is just lying in bed right okay okay sorry that must be very difficult for you yeah no great especially like in my arms my legs like just everywhere basically pretty much okay and april are you normally otherwise fit and well am i normally what i fit and well so do you have any other medical history well i have type two diabetes okay and i have quite high blood pressure okay and what do you take for your blood pressure any all medications you take on a regular basis should i say um i take metform for the diabetes yep i take lisinopril for the high blood pressure lisinopril okay fine any allergies at all to medication no allergies no okay regarding any family history is anything i should be aware of my dad also has type two diabetes but i think that's it all right who's looking after your diabetes is there anyone do you have a doctor in control i just regularly go see a doctor um and just checks up on it same with the high blood pressure like i i have it under control and since i've started taking this medication i've just been like regularly checking that it's it's under control great excellent in terms of your social situation who lives at home with you just it's just me and my partner lives okay um fine is your partner well at the moment yeah he has none of this like he's just going ahead like like nothing like i was a bit worried that i would pass it to him but right okay not diary nothing he's fine away he's got away with it at the moment okay and are you working at the moment april yeah i am working but the the first day i skipped because i was feeling just too shit yeah but then i just felt like i had to go back because i had so much to do and so i've been going in but it's not been fun no i can imagine what is it that you do for work I am a developer. I so you work in the i t field, okay. Yeah, work in i t field. i t field, right, okay. Not too active a job. No, have you been quite stressful recently? Not more than usual. I don't think it's related to stress. Like I don't feel like I've had a particularly hard time at work recently. The reason I asked is something. I haven't been able to take a day off to try and recover, so yeah, I don't think it's related to it. So the reason i'm asking is sometimes stress can really affect your immune system um but it's good to know you're you're not feeling stressed um do you smoke at all april i used to but i've stopped for about six months now okay um and what about alcohol i mean yeah i don't think i drink that much i i don't really know how you count the units but i guess like i don't drink more than like like say three evenings a week and i rarely get like properly drunk or anything and what is it that you drink wine mostly and wine how much do you drink on those nights i'd say like maybe two or three glasses okay so um yeah so you're probably just about under the limit of the recommended limit something you really need to think about just because of your blood pressure and diabetes maybe something that you can maybe cut down on if you can yeah I think i should cut down on that. Well, really ideally the right answer is to cut down completely, but so in practice i know that's not realistic. So maybe for the first few weeks when you cut down to two glasses a week and then one week thereafter and if you are coping okay then we can maybe try and cut down altogether. Okay. Just something for you to think about. Right, so just as we wrap up really April, i think based on your story i think yeah essentially i think you're going through a bit of a bit of a viral illness um i don't think there's anything to worry about you know you've had a bit of a cough bit of a runny nose feeling quite weak and lethargic i'm hoping that you know you're probably over the worst of it now it's been five days i'm hoping you're maybe going to get better the next couple of days normally last about a week to ten days what what should i do if it just keeps going on and on like if it's still going on in in say four days yeah absolutely so you know things you can do to help yourself in the meantime is to you know get some nice rest drink plenty of fluids keep yourself well hydrated you can take regular paracetamol if you feel like it's still looking any better in two to three days it's probably worth coming back to see me again we can check you over and if you are still feeling feverish and your cough isn't getting any better then we may look to give you some antibiotics for your chest which can sometimes be a common source of infection do you think i should keep going to work or do you think i should just yeah so i think really i think it depends on you it's um if you are coughing then there is a theatrical you know risk that you're maybe slightly infectious still so i would say maybe take a day or two off work if you can and get some good bed rest um and maybe think about work early next week okay okay but um if your cough isn't getting any better or your breathing is getting worse i will need to come back and see me sooner okay okay but otherwise i don't need to worry no no nothing to worry about otherwise okay all right thank you very have a good day appreciate it thank you bye"," Hello. Hello. Hi there. Before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your date of birth? Yeah. My name is April and I'm 50. You're 50. Okay. April, how can I help you this afternoon? Well, I've just been having this cough for quite a few days and my nose is running. It's just been super annoying and it's not going away. Right, okay, when did it all start? I think it started like maybe a bit less than a week ago, like maybe five or six days ago. Okay, and you mentioned a couple of things there. You mentioned a cough, you mentioned a bit of a runny nose, is that right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Let's focus on your cough first. Can you tell me a bit more about your cough uh it's just so continuous it's really really frustrating it's quite dry and it's just all day like keeps me up at night as well which is really annoying okay so it's a dry cough so you don't bring up any you don't bring up any oh i can hear that yeah and you don't bring up any uh mucky phlegm or anything like that no No. No, okay. So it keeps you up at night. You mentioned the cold symptoms as well, the runny nose. Do you have a sore throat at all? I mean, apart from, I mean, the coughing is giving me a sore throat, but it's not like, you know, not more than that. You know, just my throat is irritated from coughing, but it's not like, it's not that bad when i swallow or anything right do you have any uh are you how are your ears your ears feel blocked or no they feel okay actually yeah no pain or discharge is nothing nothing on the ears okay all right um fine in terms of your breathing, how is your chest? Is your breathing more laboured? I don't think so. I guess it's laboured when I'm coughing and I can't breathe, but I don't think so. When you walk around, you don't feel breathless, do you? I don't feel breathless. No, I feel generally feel breathless, no I feel you know generally tired yeah but not anything special with my chest. Any pain in your chest? No not that either. You mentioned feeling tired, have you felt feverish at all, have you had a temperature? I've been having like shivers, even when I'm in bed. You know, like when you go to sleep and you feel like I should be warm, but I'm still, you know, shivering a little bit. But I haven't seen my temperature, so I'm not 100% sure if I had a fever, but it feels like I probably did. Because I was just, I was next to my boyfriend and he was completely warm and totally fine and I just like could shivering more sweaters on and I was still cold okay okay all right in terms of any other symptoms have you had any nausea have you any vomiting no no no no vomiting like yeah nothing like that. How was your appetite? I mean, it's okay. At the beginning, when I was starting to have the coughing and stuff, I had a little bit of diarrhea, but it didn't cut my appetite or anything appetite or anything i just like my stomach wasn't feeling great okay has that got better now the diarrhea yeah yeah it got better it was only like the first like it started at the same time as the cough started and then it stopped so i thought everything would be fine but then the cops just stopped going okay fine um any problems with your waterworks at all? With my what? Your waterworks, your urine. Oh, no, no, no, that's fine. You're passing urine okay? You're drinking plenty of fluids and passing urine okay? Yeah, I drank loads of water when I started having the diarrhoea. Now that it's stopped I just went back to normal. Okay, all right. In terms of any other things you notice any any funny skin rashes or problems with your muscles or joints? Like my you know when I have this when I was telling you I had like the I had chills and I was really cold my muscle was really hurting. I do Pilates but it's hurting me so much at the moment. So to be honest honest all I feel like doing is just lying in bed right okay okay I'm sorry that must be very difficult for you yeah great especially like in my arms my legs like just everywhere basically we've been quite nostalgic and weak mentioned yeah pretty much okay um April are you normally otherwise fit and well? Am I normally what? Fit and well. So do you have any other medical history? Well I have type 2 diabetes. Okay. And I have quite high blood pressure. Okay and what do you take for your blood pressure? What medications do you take on a regular basis I i take metformin for the diabetes yep i take lisinopril for the high blood pressure okay fine any allergies at all to medication no allergies no okay regarding any family history is anything i should be aware of my dad also has type 2 diabetes but i think that's it all right who's after your diabetes? Do you have a doctor in a hospital? I just regularly go see a doctor and just check up on it. Same with the high blood pressure, I have it under control. Since I started taking this medication I've just been regularly checking that it's under control. Great, right excellent in terms of your social situation who lives at home with you uh just it's just me and my partner okay um fine is your partner well at the moment yeah he has none of this like he's just going ahead like like nothing nothing like I was a bit worried that I would pass it to him but right okay not uh's fine. He's got away with it at the moment. And are you working at the moment April? Yeah I am working but the first day I skipped because I was feeling just too shit but then I just felt like hard to go back because I had so much to do I've been going in but it's not been fun. No I can imagine. What is it that you do for work? I am a developer. So you work in the IT field okay. Yeah, work in IT. Right okay. Not too active a job. No, have you been quite stressful recently? more than usual usual, I don't think it's related to stress, like I don't feel like I've had a particularly hard time at work. I'm not able to take a day off to try and recover so yeah I don't think I've been stress related. So the reason I ask is sometimes stress can really affect your immune system but it's good to know you're not feeling stressed. Do you smoke at all April? I used to but I've stopped for about six months now. Okay and what about alcohol? I mean yeah I don't think I drink that much, I don't really know how you count the units, but I guess I don't drink more than, say, three evenings a week, and I rarely get properly drunk or anything. And what is it that you drink? Wine, mostly. And how much do you drink on those nights? I'd say maybe two or three glasses. so yeah so you're probably just about under the limit of the recommended limit. Something you think about just because of your blood pressure and diabetes maybe something that you can maybe cut down on if you can. Yeah? How much do you think I should cut down on it? Really, ideally, the right answer is to cut down completely. But in practice, I know that's not realistic. So maybe for the first few weeks, why don't you cut down to two glasses a week and then one week thereafter. And if you are coping okay, then we can maybe try and cut down altogether. Okay. Just something for you to think about. Right, so just as we wrap up, really, April, I think based on your story, I think essentially I think you're going through a bit of a viral illness. I don't think there's anything to worry about. You know, you've had a bit of a cough, bit of a runny nose, feeling quite weak and lethargic. I'm hoping that, you know, you're probably over the worst of it now. It's been five days. I'm hoping you're maybe going to get better the next couple of days. It normally lasts about a week to 10 days. What should I do if it just keeps going on and on? If it's still going on in, say, four days? Yeah, absolutely. So things you can do to help yourself in the meantime is to get some nice, good rest, drink plenty of fluids, keep yourself well hydrated. You can take a regular paracetamol. If you feel like it's still not getting any better in two to three days it's probably worth coming back to see me again, we can check you over and if you are still feeling feverish and your cough isn't getting any better then we may look to give you some antibiotics for your chest which can sometimes be a common source of infection. Do you think I should keep going to work or do you think i should just yeah so i think really i think it depends on you it's um if you are coughing then there is a theatrical you know risk that you're maybe slightly infectious still so i would say maybe take a day or two off work if you can and get some good bed rest um and maybe think about work early next week. Okay, okay. If your cough isn't getting any better or your breathing is getting worse, I want you to come back and see me sooner, okay? Okay, but otherwise I don't need to worry. No, nothing to worry about otherwise. Okay, alright. Thank you very much. Have a good day. Appreciate it. Thank you. Bye."

Are you, John, are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment? yeah perfect thank you for that okay so tell me what the problem is you've been having some difficulty breathing is that correct yeah exactly i'm kind of struggling to breathe at the moment i i got stung by a wasp um recently well i'm not sure whether it's kind of bitten or stung um but i i'm feeling like slightly anxious that uh there's a bit of i've got a bit of a rash on my arm where i got stung and and i kind of yeah as i said There's difficulty breathing and potentially um there's a bit of swelling in my lips and tongue. It feels a bit weird. Right, okay, so when did this bee sting or bee bite occur? Um it was just a few minutes ago. Right, okay. Um and your your lips don't seem swollen to me right now, but do they which can you show me with your finger where you feel it's swollen? Yeah, it's just kind of on the right hand side and and it's just a bit sore. kind of really swamped up yet okay you said you've been having some difficulty breathing yeah your breathing seems alright to me right now and the reason why i'm terrifying you because we have to decide whether this is an acute emergency whether i need to send you into hospital straight away or whether i have more time to ask questions okay so um do you feel that you've got difficulty breathing right now this minute as we speak i i i don't feel like it's like particularly acute but i'm just kind of a bit anxious that it might get a I just wanted to speak to someone. You do the right thing and I can understand it is quite anxiety provoking. Okay, all right. Can I just double check before we carry on and ask any other questions. Have you got a history of anaphylaxis? Not that I know of. No. Okay. Have you ever been given an EpiPen? I haven't. No. Okay. All right. Let's take a step back now. So in terms of the bee singers, did you see the bee or you're just assuming I i i find it difficult to tell that it's been a bee and a wasp but um one of the two yeah it was one of the two ok ok and um the area of the body that's stung where was it do you say it was your arm yeah it was on my arm alright and you've got a rash there can i have a look yeah sure um it's just just there ok alright that looks ok to me right now did it look red to you at the moment it's it's slightly red yeah and and kind of there's a bit of a like a hole where where i think that the yeah yeah the puncture mark yeah okay alright um now is is there any swelling around that area that you can see i couldn't see any um not particularly i guess it's just a bit kind of blotchy and a bit of a rash it doesn't feel like particularly swollen sure okay alright um now have you taken any medications it's probably you probably haven't because it was a few minutes ago but have you is it not taking any antihistamines or anything like that not at the not at the moment no nothing nothing yeah okay now if i can just go back do you have any history of any any kind of illnesses at all um i i've had eczema before um okay that's kind of the the major thing nothing nothing okay have you got a history of any allergies to anything i'm allergic to penicillin all right good um and in your family is there a history of any illnesses or any history of any kind of acute not that i think is particularly relevant no i don't have i don't have any right and um do you have allergies to any kind of cats or dogs or pets or anything like that not that i know of yeah i've been around dogs and cats Yeah, and you've got no food allergies as far as you're aware? No. Okay. Can I ask, do you suffer from anxiety or panic attacks or anything like that? Yeah, sometimes, occasionally. Right, okay. Have you ever been on medication for that? No. No. Great. Now, I need to ask a few questions, maybe not directly related to this, but just for general So are you are you working at the moment? Yes. What do you work as? I am a computer scientist. Okay. And you living alone? Yes. Okay. Do you have any pets at home? I have a cat. Okay. Great. What I'd like to do now, if that's okay John, is I'd like to have a look inside your mouth. Okay. One of the things that um would be worried about if someone's going to have an acute allergic reaction is to see whether there's any swelling of the lips or the tissues inside the mouth or the soft tissues of the airway and um i can i've got a fairly good view of your lips but i'd like maybe if you can bring your device closer to your mouth and then put your head back mouth open wide sit somewhere where there's good lighting and i just want to have a look inside the throat if that's okay perfect okay great now um um can can i just get you to do it again yeah just say r this time r okay fantastic brilliant okay um ah john based on um how you look how you're talking to me and how you're breathing and the appearance on your wrist um i don't feel that you're having an and a life threatening allergic reaction now it's very normal to have a rash when you have some kind of insect bite it's a um, localized, um, inflammatory reaction that, um, is normal and that, in immediate reaction, that redness and that's maybe slight swelling is usually temporary. What we're worried about is when someone has, um, compromise of their breathing. So you mentioned breathing difficulties and the immediate swelling, you said, thankfully I can't see any of that right now, but that's the most urgent and most pressing thing that we'll be watching out for. even that it hasn't happened initially it's unlikely to happen later okay so we have like a stage one and stage two reaction for these types of bites and usually if you're going to have the reaction it will happen straight away so we may be coming out of the danger zone now it's um but i'm just going to warn you about what those signs and symptoms are in case it happens so for example you would have swelling of the lips difficulty breathing you might have something called stridor which is an inspiratory sound that you when you're trying to breathe it makes like a rasping sound this okay so thankfully you don't have anything like that right now it seems to me that this is a localized allergic reaction however if anything changes if anything deteriorates either make an appointment with us or go straight to a and e and in some cases if it's if it's progressing rapidly it's better to go straight to a and e rather than to wait for a booked appointment with us okay what i'd like you to do now is i'd like you to try and take some antihistamines so you can buy them with the counter you can get piriton or and you can take one tablet four milligrams up to about six times a day okay or you can just take a one a day one whichever is your preference that's that's absolutely fine there's no no issue that should be enough to control this um if the redness in your arm spreads and you feel hot or you know you have signs of any localised infection we may need to think about other treatments like an antibiotic and like i said if anything deteriorates in terms of your breathing that's and we need to process that you need to Actually needs to be taken urgently did you have any other um queries or was there anything else that you were worried about uh no i think i think that kind of that makes me feel a bit better i guess can i get that um can i get the uh sorry the anti-histamine from any shop or like does it have to be in the pharmacy yeah any over the counter you don't need to any chemist will have it you don't need a prescription yeah it's probably cheaper to buy it over the counter actually than to get it by prescription okay now um on the basis of what you told me i don't think you need any allergy testing i think this is just a straightforward localized reaction to an insect bite however if it was to happen that you know this you're having these kind of reactions on a regular basis or other non-specific rashes you might need to think about the testing i don't think we're at that moment yet okay so but that's something to bear in mind in case this becomes a recurrent pattern okay okay so we'll leave it like that for now okay i'm going to leave it to some information about anaphylactic reactions I don't want you to panic, but just for you to be aware what symptoms are.

You've been having some difficulty breathing, is that correct? Yeah, exactly. I'm kind of struggling to breathe at the moment. I got stung by a wasp recently, but I'm not sure whether it's kind of bitten or stung, but I'm feeling like slightly anxious that there's a bit of, I've got a bit of a rash on my arm where I got stung and I kind of, yeah, as I say, I've got this difficulty breathing and potentially there's a bit of swelling in my lips and tongue, feels a bit weird.

Yeah's just kind of on the right hand side and and it's just a bit sore maybe it hasn't kind of really enough yeah okay you said you've been having some difficulty breathing yeah your breathing seems all right to me right now and the reason why I'm terrifying you because we have to decide whether this is an acute emergency whether I need to send you into hospital straight away or whether there's more time to ask questions. OK, so do you feel like you've got difficulty breathing right now, this minute as we speak? I don't feel like it's particularly acute, but I'm just kind of a bit anxious that it might get a bit worse. I just wanted to speak to someone. You did the right thing and I can understand it is quite anxiety provoking. Okay all right can I just double check before we carry on asking any other questions. Have you got a history of anaphylaxis? Not that I know of. No okay. Have you ever been given an epi pen? I haven't no. Okay all right let's take a step back now. So in terms of the bee sting, did you see the bee or you were just assuming it was a bee? I find it difficult to tell the difference between a bee and a wasp. One of the two? Yeah, it was one of the two. Okay. And the area of your body that stung, where was it? Did you say it was your arm? Yeah, it was on my arm. arm all right and you've got a rash there can i have a look uh yeah sure um it's just just there okay all right that looks okay to me right now did it look red to you at the moment it's it's slightly red yeah and i'm kind of there's a bit of a like a hole where where I think that the... Yes, yeah, yeah, and there's a bit of a hole where I think that the blossom... Yeah, the puncture mark, yeah, okay, alright. Now, is there any swelling around that area that you can see? I couldn't see any. Not particularly, I guess it's just a bit kind of blotchy and a bit of a rash. It doesn't feel like particularly swollen. Sure, okay, all right. Now have you taken any medications? You probably haven't because it was a few minutes ago, but have you not taken any antihistamines or anything like that? Not at the moment, no, nothing yet. Okay. Now if I can just go back, do you have any history of any kind of illnesses at all? I've had eczema before. Okay. That's kind of the major thing. Nothing, nothing. Okay. Have you got a history of any allergies to anything? I'm allergic to penicillin all right good um and in your family is there any history of any illnesses or any history of any kind of acute not that i think is particularly relevant no i don't have i don't have any right and um do you have allergies to any kind of cats or dogs or pets or anything like that? Not that I know of. Yeah, I've been around dogs and cats. And you've got no food allergies as far as you're aware? No. Okay. Can I ask, do you suffer from anxiety or panic attacks or anything like that? Yeah, sometimes, occasionally. Right, okay. Have you ever been on medication for that? No. No. Great. Now, I need to ask a few questions, maybe not directly related to this, but just for general information purposes. So, are you working at the moment? Yes. What do you work as? I am a computer scientist. Okay and you're living alone? Yes. Okay do you have any pets at home? I have a cat. Okay what I'd like to do now, if that's okay John, is I'd like to have a look inside your mouth, okay? One of the things that we'd be worried about if someone's going to have an acute allergic reaction is to see whether there's any swelling of the lips or the tissues inside the mouth, the soft tissues of the airway. And I've got a fairly good view of your lips, but I'd like maybe if you can bring your device closer to your mouth and then put your head back, mouth open wide, sit somewhere where there's good lighting, and I just want to have a look inside the throat, if that's okay. Perfect. Okay, great. Now, can I just get you to do it again? Yeah. Just say ah this time. Ah. Okay, fantastic, brilliant. Okay. John, based on how you look, how you're talking to me, how you're breathing, and the appearance on your wrist, I don't feel that you're having a life-threatening allergic reaction. Now, it's very normal to have a rash when you have some kind of insect bite. It's a localised inflammatory reaction that is normal and that immediate reaction, that redness and that's maybe slight swelling, is usually temporary. What we're worried about is when someone has compromise of their breathing. So you mentioned breathing difficulties and the emitter swelling. Thankfully, I can't see any of that right now. Right. But that's the most urgent and most pressing thing that we'll be watching out for. Given that it hasn't happened initially, it's unlikely to happen later. So we have like a stage one a stage two reaction for these types of bites and usually if you're going to have their reaction it will happen straight away so we may be coming out of the danger zone now it's um but i'm just going to warn you about what those signs and symptoms are in case it happens so for example you would have swelling of the lips difficulty breathing you might have something called stridor, which is an inspiratory sound that when you're trying to breathe, it makes like a rasping sound like this. Okay, thankfully you don't have anything like that right now. It seems to me that this is a localized allergic reaction. However, if anything changes, if anything deteriorates, either make an appointment with us or go straight to A&E. And in some cases, if it's progressing rapidly, it's better to go straight to A&E rather than to wait for a booked appointment with us, okay? What I'd like you to do now is I'd like you to try and take some antihistamines. So you can buy them from the counter. You can get Pyrotone or Glufenamine, and you can take one tablet, four milligrams, up to about six times a day, okay? Or you can just take a one-a-day one, whichever is your preference, that's absolutely fine, there's no issue. That should be enough to control this. If the redness in your arm spreads and it feels hot or you have signs of any localized infection, we may need to think about other treatments like an antibiotic. And like I said, if anything deteriorates in terms of your breathing, that's urgent and we need to process that. Someone actually needs to be taken urgently. Did you have any other queries or was there anything else that you were worried about? No, I think that makes me feel a bit better. I guess, can I get the anti-histamine from any shop or like does that have to be pharmacy yeah over the counter you don't need to any chemist will have it you don't need to yeah it's probably cheaper to buy it over the counter actually than to get it by prescription okay um now um on the basis of what you told me i don't think you need any allergy. I think this is just a straightforward localized reaction to an insect bite. However, if it was to happen that you're having these kind of reactions on a regular basis or other non-specific reactions, you might need to think about blood testing. I don't think we're at that moment yet, okay? So that's something to bear in mind in case this becomes a recurrent pattern. Okay. Okay, then. So we'll leave it like that for now. Okay, I'm going to leave you with some information about anaphylactic reactions, just for you to read about it. I don't want you to panic, but just for you to be aware of what the symptoms are. If those kind of things happen, get back to us. If you're feeling worried, just have a low threshold for having a chat with us. Sometimes a chat is all you need to calm things down. Okay, great. Yeah, that makes sense. All right then, John. Okay. Well, we'll leave it at that. Come back to us if you have any further issues. Okay, thanks. I appreciate your time. My pleasure. All right.

And how is baby doing? Yep he's good. Any coughs or colds with them? No no he's fine. Okay so you've noticed shortness of breath for just an hour while sitting watching TV and you had your C-section a couple of weeks ago. Yes. And yesterday you noticed a cough. Yeah. So talk to me about the cough. Have you brought anything up? No, I haven't, no. And when was the last time you were ill with flu or symptoms like this? um you know i get coughs and colds quite a lot, but probably a good few months ago. OK. And this shortness of breath you're having, is it getting worse? No. I mean, I don't know. I feel like I'm getting really stressed out because like my heart is really going. OK, so you're feeling your heart more than normal? Yeah. And the shortness of breath, does it cause any pain in your chest? No. How about when you take a very deep breath in? I mean, yeah, my chest feels sore, but so does my C-section scar you know it's all tender. Okay and since your c-section did you have to take any medications? No just some painkillers. And can you remember what the name of those were? They gave me some codeine. And have you had to use that regularly? Yeah I've been taking that fairly regularly but probably haven't taken it for a week. Okay and apart from the c-section and the shortness of breath have you got any other medical problems I should know about? No. And are you allergic? I can tell you I'm allergic to ibuprofen though. Okay and what happens when you take ibuprofen? I don't know. So I need you to do something for me. Have you measured the rate of your heart before? Yes. Have you measured it recently either with an iWatch or something similar no I haven't no okay we might need to do that over the phone so are you able to put your right hand on your left wrist just underneath your thumb and feel your heartbeat yeah so what I want you to do is when I count to three, count down from three, just count the number of beats you've noticed and I'll tell you when to stop, is that okay? Yep. So we'll start in three, two, one, go. Great, that should be enough. How many did you count? I counted 30. Good. So your heart is running slightly fast at the moment, which is probably because of your shortness of breath and some of the pain that you're under. Okay. Given that you've had a C-section and you're short of breath which has come on quite recently and quite quickly it might be worth you going into the hospital to get checked out a bit further. Okay. So there's two ways of us doing this. The first is I can call an ambulance or you can take yourself to the hospital with baby, which one would you prefer? It feels a bit dramatic to call an ambulance. I'll go. I'll take myself. Sure. And what I would suggest is go fairly quickly and take some bits for baby at the same time. Okay. And if you're taking any medications like codeine, don't take them for the time being. Okay. Is anyone else with you at home? no my partner's at work okay so i think that's the best thing to do for the time being so what i'm worried about at the moment is given that you've had a c-section some people can suffer with clots and those can either be found in the legs or your chest so in your lungs yeah it's quite a common thing to happen and it's not something to worry about but needs to be checked out in the hospital first okay and if it if that does become the case they can give you something to reduce the clot all right okay that's a really quick process okay yeah i mean my mum's had uh clots in her legs before so so I guess, you know, yeah, that makes sense. I know what they are. Good. Are you particularly worried about anything, or do you want to ask me anything before we go? No, no, I'm fine. I'll just take myself to the hospital. Great. Thank you so much. All right. Thank you. Bye."

Three or four days ago you started developing and is the cough worse at night time? No, it's the same throughout the day. And when you say you're short of breath, just need to try and get an idea about how short of breath you are so are you able to like walk up flights of stairs for example or are you short breath of rest oh yeah it's like when I'm doing walking and I do exercise now and then so it hasn't been super bad like hasn't stopped me from doing any of those things but it's been pretty unusual and a little bit worried and you're a bit concerned about that okay so I just need to ask a few things about your background as well so do you have any other medical conditions or medical history no just no no No history of asthma? No. And any history of clots on your legs or your lungs? These are DDT's or P's. No one in your family's had those? Clots on the legs or the lungs? Well my mother had lung cancer. Your mother had lung cancer. Do you smoke? No. Have you ever smoked or been exposed to asbestos? I don't know if asbestos ever smoked. I mean once or twice in Amsterdam, in Dakar, but not really. Okay and this, just going back to your symptoms of shortness of breath with the cough, it's a dry cough, not cough, cap, flem. Do you have, and you say you don't have any chest pain as such. Are you taking any medications currently at the moment? No, I'm not. Okay. Are you allergic to any medications? Not to any medication, but I'm allergic to peanuts. Peanuts, okay. And you mentioned that your mother had lung cancer. Any other family history of any significant illnesses when running into family? No, no, that's the only one just lung cancer from my mother. Okay and you say you have a cold so do you have sinus congestion or? No it seems to be all entirely with just my throat, like my nose is just running out. Just your throat and any recent travel or have you always lived in the UK no so I I haven't always lived in the UK like so I was born in the US and 12 years ago but it's a recent travel just to Europe nowhere to exotic okay so no so no recent travel no significant recent travel anywhere um okay and are you coughing up anything other than um so you're not coughing up blood or anything like that um good and uh are you feeling feverish hot cold sweaty, so a little bit feverish at first. So the first three or so days of this, but then the fever's gone away. OK. And in general, do you feel better? Sorry. Yeah. Yeah, I was just going to say I also had a bit of a headache. Like, headaches that come and go, rather. But right now, it's fine. OK. And in general, would you say you're beginning to feel better, worse, or sort of staying the same? So it's like, it's up and down. So let's see. So I started last week and I stayed home from work two days this week. I think it was maybe Tuesday and then Thursday. So like I felt better and then worse again, and then better and then worse again. So it's been a kind of constant, but constant in being variable. Okay. And I just need to ask any other sort of risk factors, um, that you may have. So, um, no sort of significant weight loss, um, or unexplained weight loss. Any? So no no weight loss but I have been losing my appetite recently and I mean I usually eat a lot so I enjoy eating as well but that's been a bit concerning. You've been losing your appetite recently? Yes. And you're a little bit concerned about that but you haven't lost any weight lost any weight that you think no not that and any um sort of rashes or anything uh and you no no okay um so i would ask to examine you now but um i i don't know if i could sort of look inside your throat at least see if there's a probably we can try oh no well no it's okay I might think about doing have you got any lumps or bumps around your neck that you could feel no not the no okay and and so finally you were talking about I, it sounds to me that you've been a little bit up and down, sore throat, developed a dry cough, you are slightly short of breath, but not too overly concerningly short of breath. What I would say, we're just coming to the end of the consultation now, is if you feel significantly worse, if you get more short of breath or sudden change in your breathlessness or breathlessness that you are concerned about and I would advise you to see a GP and actually see something physically but I think for now I can sort of try and reassure you that if this clears up as I expect it would, so expect this to sort of be getting better in the next four or five days. If it's not, please get in touch with the medical professional again. And I would expect it to, and so therefore I wouldn't be concerned about tuberculosis. Your concerns about lung cancer are... Was that the other thing you were concerned about? Oh yeah, yeah. So again, if you're not getting better, please see somebody again. I've just got four seconds now, so nice talking to you. And we've got to tidy up, yeah. Okay, okay so and I'll provide you with a sick note just to give you a few more days of work and paracetamol lots of fluids and rest up and as I say if you're not feeling better please get in touch okay all right thank you"

Just kind of started a few months ago, a few months ago. Yeah, i really enjoy it. Very good. Good. In terms of smoking and alcohol, do you do you participate in either? Uh, as i admitted before, i tried weed the first time, uh, but i don't smoke. Uh, i drink occasionally, um, kind of socially, um, with friends. Okay, and what, what made you have your first joint last week? Was that, um, i it was just a party um there were a lot of people doing it um i kind of was a little bit tipsy so probably wasn't thinking quite straight um but yeah i i completely agree it's not something i want to get into on a regular basis sure and obviously as your doctor something to look after you so i would strongly recommend you you know to avoid it your head great um fine so at this age i wouldn't normally examine you but i think based on your story i think um you know i'm reassured by the fact i think it's um probably just a simple what we say a uti or a cystitis bladder infection um you know you haven't got any other symptoms that suggest to me there's anything to worry about so things like fevers and back pain um would be more worrying for me to hear um so some we we can treat quite readily with antibiotics um so we've got a choice of two antibiotics something called trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin which is a three day course normally they're usually quite effective um for your symptoms it's probably worth giving us a urine sample as well if you can so we can send it off to the lab and see what's going on there um start the antibiotics make sure you're well hydrated drink plenty of fluids um yeah if you are having some pain simple paracetamol would probably be advisable um we'll see what the urine sample shows um and if it is indeed positive we'll know which antibiotics are the right ones um but if things are still looking any better next week come back and see me and we can have another look again okay okay great um with with the urine sample um ah how do i go about doing that you know is it through the app no well that's a good question so i will give you i will organise for you to come in and drop off a sample at one of our practices which we can test there and then with the urine dip and send it off to the lab and we can always get back in touch with you with the results Okay, perfect. Do bear in mind those symptoms I mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting. If you have any of those, give me a call. Okay. Fever, back pain, vomiting. Great. Okay, yeah, I'll be chatting with those. Okay. Have a good day. Okay. Thank you. You too. Have a good day. Bye bye."," next door hello hi can you hear me okay yeah i can hear you right excellent before i go any further can i confirm your name and your age please sure um i'm amanda jackson and i'm 19 years old 19 years old okay amanda and how can i help you this afternoon um so it's been going on for a few days now um it's not happened before and I'm a bit worried. It hurts when I kind of pee and yeah it's like I'm going to the toilet a lot more and it's really like I can't like go to uni properly. I'm just like constantly looking for the toilet. It kind of hurts sometimes when I'm like in the bottom of my tummy as well. Right, I'm sure there's a lot going on there and I can see why it's affecting you. So you mentioned you've been going for the last three days mainly the burning pain when you pass urine. You said you go to the toilet more often as well, is that right? Yeah, going on for a little bit longer than three days I think actually, maybe just under a week. Oh under sorry um okay sorry no I didn't explain it properly before um yeah no I it's been going on for about just under a week um and yeah I notice sort of burning stinging when I when I go to the toilet yeah have you noticed any anything your urine for example any blood or um discoloration of urine um i think well today I noticed it was like a bit pink the urine. Yeah I think just today. Any kind of frank blood I mean red blood at all in your urine? I think it was mixed in probably I don't know it was pink. Okay Okay, fine, we'll definitely explore that in a little bit more detail later on. You also mentioned some tummy pain as well, can you tell me a bit more about that pain? Yeah, it's kind of at the bottom of my tummy, mainly when I go to the loo, I think that's when it's worse. Okay, can you describe, is it crampampy pain is there more of a burning pain I wouldn't describe this crampy I don't think it's like a period pain it's a bit different it's hard to say an achy pain I suppose okay there's a pain move anywhere else is move towards your back towards your, no. Okay, alright. Any other symptoms at all, for example nausea, vomiting? No, no nausea, vomiting. Any temperatures or fevers? No, no, not that I've noticed. Okay, alright. And how are your bowels at the moment? Are your bowels working okay? I usually have a bit of problems with my bowels anyway, so I don't think it's any different from what it usually is. When you say you have problems, what kind of problems do you normally have? I think I have IBS, so I just pass my bowels quite a lot and sometimes it's quite variable, like sometimes it's a bit softer, sometimes it's a bit, sorry this is a bit disgusting, but sometimes it's a bit harder and kind of hard to predict. Okay, alright, but you've noticed no new symptoms in your bowels? No, no, not that I can say. All right. And Amanda, sometimes we have to ask quite extensive questions, as you can imagine. Can I ask, are you currently sexually active at the moment? Yeah, I have a long-term boyfriend. Okay, and have you noticed any other discharge from down below, so from the front passage? No, I don't think so, nothing unusual. Okay, do you use any form of contraception? Yeah, I'm on the pill. What kind of pill is it? The combined pill or the mini pill? Combined pill. Okay fine. When was the last time you had unprotected sex? I mean unprotected is it like no condoms or anything yeah exactly I guess because I don't really use condoms with my boyfriend just like I don't know we've just kind of agreed so I guess a week what I'm trying to get at is whether any chance you could be at all. I know you're on the pill but nonetheless we do have to ask. When was your last period? Two weeks ago. Two weeks ago, okay, alright. Just something for us to bear in mind if your symptoms don't get any better, okay? In terms of your general health otherwise at the moment are you eating and drinking okay uh yeah yeah eating drinking okay um i did have one kind of concern i don't know so i smoked uh this is quite bad but i smoked weed for the first time like a week and a half ago i just wonder whether it's related at all probably not but i just thought i'd get some advice from you sure well thanks for sharing with me um so i don't think it is related to your symptoms i think it's probably just pure coincidence um but uh you know i do strongly advise you to you know make it a regular habit if you can, just for your general health moving forwards. Okay, moving on, in terms of your health otherwise, do you have any other medical conditions apart from the IBS? Is there anything else I should be aware of? No. No? Okay, great. And what about any medications that you take on a regular basis apart from the combined pill? Apart from the pill, I take something for the IBS as well. It begins with an M, it's really hard to pronounce, like maybe something. Yeah, okay. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, that's right. And then after the cramps, the crampy pain pain yeah yeah and do you have any allergies any medications um yeah i think there's an antibiotic um called clindus clindamycin that i took like a couple years ago something and yeah that that didn't go too well right with me okay sure i'll make a note of that um in terms of family history any history of problems with the bladder or the kidneys no no anything else good and socially tell me a bit more about your home situation who's at home with you um so i am living in halls at the moment uh uni um so I'm just living with a flatmate I suppose, but my family live kind of outside of London, not too far away, so yeah my family are fine and I see them now and then. Very good. Yeah, things are okay generally. Great, and what are you studying at university? I'm studying English. English okay good and how are you enjoying your course? Yeah yeah it's going well thanks just kind of started a few months ago yeah I really enjoy it. Very good good. In terms of smoking and alcohol do you participate in either? As I admitted before I tried weed the first time but I don't smoke I drink occasionally socially with friends. What made you have your first joint last week? I was just a party, there were other people doing it. I kind of was a little bit tipsy, so probably wasn't thinking quite straight. But yeah, I completely agree. It's not something I want to get into on a regular basis. Sure. And obviously, as your doctor's something to look after, so I would strongly recommend you to avoid it. Great. Fine. So, as they said, I wouldn't normally examine you, but I think based on your story, I think, you know, I'm reassured by the fact I think it's probably just a simple what we say UTI or cystitis, bladder infection. You know, you haven't any other symptoms that suggest to me that there's anything to worry about. So things like fevers and back pain would be more worrying for me to hear so something we can treat quite readily with antibiotics so we've got choices to antibiotics something called trimethoprine or nitrofurantoin which is a three-day course normally they're usually quite effective for your symptoms it's probably worth giving us a urine sample as well if you can so so we can send it off to the lab and see exactly what's going on there. Start the antibiotics, make sure you're well hydrated, drink plenty of fluids. If you are having some pain, simple paracetamol would probably be advisable. We'll see what the urine sample shows and if it is indeed positive we'll know which antibiotics are the right ones. But if things are still not getting better next week come back and see me and we can have another look again. Okay, great. With the urine sample, how do I go about doing that? No, well, good question. So I will give you, I will organise for you to come in and drop up a sample at one of our practices, which we can test there and then, whether you're in depth and send it off to the lab and we can always get back in touch with you with the results. Okay, perfect. Okay. Do bear in mind those symptoms I mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting. If you have any of those, give me a call, okay? Fever, back pain, vomiting. Great. Okay, yeah. I'll check those. Okay. Have a good day. Okay. Great. Thank you. You too. Have a good day. Bye-bye."

And if you increase it so you're taking it two to four puffs like every four hours? initially um if you get a high temperature or your wheezing is getting worse you need to call us back straight away so we can just advise you further with that okay and it will be a good idea when you're feeling better if we could arrange just a review just to see how your asthma is because we may need to start some other medication for you okay sounds good you can arrange a review in a week or so um but but before that and if you're if you're feeling worse yeah a week right okay okay and the other thing to do would be to take a regular antihistamine which you can get from the pharmacy i can put a question in on your notes about what to take yeah that'll be helpful and then if you when you get the peak flow meter if you can take the pharmacist can show you how to use it and if you could record a value first When you wake up in the evening over the next week and then we can discuss that over the phone when we look at the figures and see whether you need to go on another inhaler as well.

Okay, so that will be like crackers, toast, jam, those kind of things that's easily digested, like what we would give babies, yeah? When they start eating, you give simple food for babies. You don't give eggs or meat the first time they start feeding. So that's the kind of soft diet we're talking about. Yeah. Once you are able to, you know, keep most most of it in you can start off with some just boiled vegetables and mash once you're okay with that for about 48 hours then you can start having meat so just don't have meat once you feel like you're slightly better because you might go back to square one again. All right? What do you mean okay with that diet? Like once? Well, 48 hours, you're not having any diarrhea, you're fine, then you can go and start having meat, egg, fish and all. So that's when you feel- If the diarrhea is getting better, but isn't getting, or do you want it to go away completely at that point? Or if's like trending up no no no you preferably just don't because why do we say this is because it takes much more time for meat to get digested so because your gut flora you know the the bacteria in your gut is not you know as it should be it takes a bit more effort for one to digest these food while it doesn't take that much of an effort to you know digest mash and vegetables does that make sense yes yeah so at the same time you could have some although you can't milk is not a good idea yogurts are a good idea because they are probiotics it helped to build up the normal um gut bacteria back okay so those kind of now things to look out for if your diarrhea doesn't go away in a week's time or if you're passing blood we need a stool sample because that means you may have one some particular bugs that might need treatment with antibiotics okay okay if you again as i've mentioned previously if you're going about six to eight times a day that means there's a high chance that you are having dehydration and you might need to go into hospital at that point in time if that happens you get in touch with us again all right okay any questions you look a bit confused now that's it yeah okay and also you could get something called dirolyte over-the over the counter so it helps to replenish your the salts that you've been that's lost through going to the toilet okay okay if you're a bit confused you know you can actually all this is all recorded in your app so you can't go back I'll put that all in detail so if you know I know sometimes it's a bit difficult to process everything you can go back and read the notes that's great all right then you take care"

Any problems when you look into the light? No. And have you been eating and drinking okay? Yes, yes, like normal. Are you feeling sick or vomiting or anything? No, nothing like that. Any high fever? Are you feeling shivery, sweaty? No, no fever. Any rashes at all? No. And in the past have you had any headaches before? Not really. Okay how bad would you say the headache is from zero to ten if ten is the worst pain that you could have and zero is nothing? I'd say about eight. Okay and have you taken any painkillers? I took some Nurofen yesterday. Okay and did that make any difference? Not really. Okay and last night did you manage to sleep through the night okay? Uh yes I did. Has it been worse at any particular time of the day? No it hasn't made any difference at the time of the day. Any difference if you lie down, stand up, bend over, cough or sneeze or anything like that? No. And have you got any other medical problems? No I haven't. Anything you take medication for? No I don't. Any over-the-counter medications or allergies? No, only the Nurofen I took yesterday, Ibuprofen. Any stomach problems or asthma at all? No. Anyone in your family got any medical problems? My mother's had hypertension and she does get migraines. And have you had your blood pressure chapter? No not recently. And who do you live with at home? Sorry? Who do you live with at home? My partner. And what's your job day to day? I'm a designer. Have you had to miss any work at all? No, but I don't feel that I'm finding it really hard to do any of my work or normal things. Okay. And do you smoke at all normally? No, I don't. Do you drink any alcohol regularly? No. And any other drugs? No. No. Okay. I mean, the fact that you haven't had headaches before is unusual, the fact that they've developed. Is there anything you think has changed, any increased stress, any change in your diet or lifestyle? Not that I can think of. Okay. So what we would suggest is trying a slightly stronger pain relief, so similar to ibuprofen, but taking it instead of ibuprofen, not at the same time, and taking that regularly with food. Hopefully that will settle it down. You can take paracetamol along with that. Try and take rest, have lots of good hydration. But if the pain's getting worse, you get new symptoms fever rash vomiting neck stiffness um or you keep getting episodes of the same type of thing then we need to speak to you and make a plan for what we can do next okay thank you any other questions How long do you think it will last for? Well I should think it should go down if it's getting worse or not settling in the next day or two then certainly give us a call back if when you've tried the medication that I've described from the pharmacy. Okay. Okay. Thank you. All right then thanks a lot. Bye."

Any allergies to any medications at all? Not that I'm aware of, no. Okay. So what you've described to me, it sounds like you probably have got an infection in the chest um because it's it you know you're obviously getting the symptoms of from your nose and your chest um it sounds like you might have it at high temperatures it's definitely worth getting a thermometer and checking your temperature okay i can just get one of those at a pharmacy or something Yeah, most of the time these infections are caused by viruses so they do normally settle by themselves but it can take you know a week or two and you can consistently have the cough ongoing longer than that. The important thing to do would be to check your temperature and if you feel like if the temperature is ongoing above 37.5, 38 and you keep spiking temperatures and that's not settling down or your cough is getting worse, you're coughing up lots of nasty phlegm or you cough up any blood or get blood coming up your nose or any shortness of breath, chest pain, then we certainly would need to speak to you again. With the diabetes you are a bit more likely to get a bacterial infection than if you didn't have the diabetes, so it's something that we do need to be careful of. Okay, so then we would look at potentially antibiotics at that time perhaps? Yeah, potentially. If it's not settling or the temperature's ongoing getting worse, then we definitely need to talk to you again. Okay. Have you got any other questions? No, that's all fine. It's fine to carry on what you're doing at the moment with the LemSip. I wouldn't take... and that contains paracetamol, so don't take any other paracetamol containing products with that at the same time. The cough syrup isn't advisable in the daytime, it's best for your body if you just keep coughing, but if you're kept up all night and you can't sleep at all, then it's okay to have a little bit of cough syrup just to settle that down. Okay. Cool. Okay. Do you have blood sugar checking equipment? Not at home. No. Okay. Well, if you make sure that you have the regular diabetes and blood pressure checkups that your GP has asked you for. Yeah. Okay. Great. All right, then. Take care. All right. Thanks very much. Bye."

Like I said, with the difficulty of climbing upstairs and going uphill, I try to limit my daily activity to just moving around the house, nothing too strenuous. And do you live at home with your wife at the moment? ah yes okay i would suggest if she's there you let her know that you'll both be having an adventure to the hospital today so she might need to get your things together got it okay the ambulance should be there very soon in the meantime i would suggest that you stay calm and have some water if you need to don't take any of those medications the paramedics should be with you very shortly all right so when they do come there are two things they will be worried the one is your chest so your heart and second is your breathing which is your lungs so they will give you lots of things to breathe through and attach things to your arms just to check things like your blood pressure and your heart rate so don't be worried and when you get to the hospital you'll be seen by a consultant pretty much immediately reassuring things for that sure so i will let the paramedics do their job and when you're at the hospital the consultant would normally call me within a couple of minutes to let me know how everything's going oh that's great great i'll book another appointment to see you soon once you've had your adventure that's perfect thank you so much no problems do you have any questions for me no questions i'll just wait to see the ambulance great thank you very much no problems i'll speak to you soon thank you so much Right, okay."," Hello? Hello, can you hear me? Yeah, I can. Can you hear me? I can, I'm very clear. Hi, my name is Dr. Gohil. Hi, I'm one of the physicians that works at Babylon. Are you in a quiet and private space? Well, I am, yes Good and can I confirm your name and date of birth please? It's Joe Bloggs, it's the 7th of June 1974. 74 and how old does that make you? Sorry 54. Perfect. I'm supposedly 53. Great and it says here it says you're having chest discomfort is that correct? That is correct yes I'm experiencing discomfort in my chest. Okay can you tell me a little bit more about your chest discomfort when it started and how you're feeling at the moment? Sure it's been ongoing for a couple of hours now I'll say that it's gone quite suddenly I was digging in the garden and it I had to describe where it is somewhere in the middle of my chest and it's more it feels more like a pressure they just come for them more than a pain if I had If I had to describe what that discomfort feeling is, it's like someone's sitting on my chest. Okay. Yeah. Great. So you've talked about your chest. Are you still in discomfort at the moment? Yes, as you said. Okay. And when it it started how would you rate it out out of ten and how about now? It's still the same. Okay. seven is quite manageable, it's quite comfortable. And how about now? It's still the same. And tell me before this happened, what were you doing? I was relaxing with my wife and we were watching Jeremy Kyle. Okay. And we still go out to the Okay. And how often do you do gardening? Every other week, so fortnightly. Okay. And are you normally fit and well? So are you normally okay to garden as you would? Yes. Great. And apart from this, do you have any other medical problems? High cholesterol and hypertension. Okay so that's high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Do you take any medicines for that? No I don't take any medicine. And you allergic to anything? Aspirin. Okay. So let me summarise what you've told me already. You were gardening a few hours ago and you experienced chest discomfort, which was roughly 7 out of 10. Yeah. It feels more like someone's sitting on your chest as opposed to pain. Yes, that's fair. And apart from this, have you noticed anything else unusual, specifically with your breathing? Yes, I have. I've got shortness of breath. I feel slightly lightheaded. Okay, and is that getting worse or better? It's remained the same, although I'll say recently I've noticed in terms of sort of breathing, I've had some difficulty climbing stairs and if I have to sort of walk uphill, there's that sort of as well. And when you get short of breath when you're walking up the stairs, have you noticed any pain? No pain as such, but there's often calf pain and leg swelling sometimes. Okay, so let me confirm, you have the pressure at the moment and you have shortness of breath. Is that correct? That is correct, yes. So given what you've told me about your past medical history, I think it might be worth you calling an ambulance. Okay. Get you to the hospital as soon as possible. Because my concern is it might be something to do with your heart. So, while we talk to you, I will ring an ambulance who should come to your address. Right. But in the meantime, I think we should stay on the phone so I can gather some more information that we can give to the paramedics. Is that okay? Should I be concerned about anything? It's nothing to worry about at the moment, but given that you've got high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and you've got some chest pain, I'm always worried about the heart first before anything else. Again, make that point. And we need to look after your heart before anything else. Yeah. So apart from this lightheadedness and this chest discomfort, have you noticed anything else unusual? Thank you. So apart from this lightheadedness and this chest discomfort, have you noticed anything else unusual? Nothing else unusual. I'm not sure if I spoke to you about nausea. I've noticed some nausea but no vomiting yet. Do you have anything to eat or drink this morning? No. And you still feel nauseous at the moment? I have, yeah. I am, yeah. So I have a couple of other questions to ask you, and I'm going to reel them off. So apologies for not letting you talk very much. No, that's fine. Have you noticed this pressure radiating to your head? No, to my head, no. And how about to your left or right arm? Yes, there is some pain in my left shoulder right now. And does that pain go anywhere else, to your left arm or to your back? No. And have you noticed any problems swallowing or drinking water? No. Good. And have you noticed any problems going into the loo? No problems going into the loo. And you're normally fit and well apart from the two things you told me about? Yes, however, there are some problems just performing daily activities. Like I said, with the difficulties climbing up stairs and going uphill, I try to limit my daily activity to just moving around the house, nothing to stress. And do you live at home with your wife at the moment? Yes. Okay. I would suggest if she's there, you let her know that you'll both be having an adventure to the hospital today, so she might need to get your things together. Got it. Okay. The ambulance should be there very soon. In the meantime, I would suggest that you stay calm and have some water if you need to. Don't take any of those medications. Okay. The paramedics should be with you very shortly. Right. So when they do come, there are two things they will be worried about. Okay. The one is your chest, so your heart. And the second is your breathing, which is your lungs. Okay. So they will give you lots of things to breathe through and attach things to your arms, just to check things like your blood pressure and your heart rate. So't be worried and when you get to the hospital you'll be seen by a consultant pretty pretty much immediately yeah that's right reassuring things for that sure so i will let the paramedics do their job and when you're at the, the consultant would normally call me within a couple of minutes to let me know how everything's going. Oh, that's great. Great. I'll book another appointment to see you soon, once you've had your adventure. That's perfect. Thank you so much. No problems. Do you have any questions for me? No questions. I'll just await the ambulance. Great. Thank you very much. No problem, I'll speak to you soon. Thank you so much. Bye."

01:02:01
[Speaker 2]: Yes. I definitely notice blood on the toilet paper. Sometimes there's even blood dripping into the toilet after i finished going into the bathroom 

01:16:99
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That a significant amount of bleeding. So i want to investigate on this further. So i want to ask you about your diet. Have you notice any changes in your appetite or the food you're eating? 

01:35:03
[Speaker 2]: To be honest, my appetite has been i little bit up lately. I have been feeling an unusual. I have been having to force myself to eat sometimes. I haven't really made a big changes to my diet though

01:53:02
[Speaker 1]: Ok. So Thank you for sharing this information. I have a few more questions to ask about your medical history and family history and all. First can you tell me about your past medical history including any surgeries or hospitalizations?

02:21:00
[Speaker 2]: I haven't really had any major surgeries or hospitalizations in the past. I have high blood pressure but it is well controlled with medication 

02:33:98
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That's good to hear. And regarding your family history can you tell me about your family history either your mom or your dad?

02:54:03
[Speaker 2]: Regarding my family. My father passed away from colorectal cancer 

03:02:02
[Speaker 1]: Ok

03:04:02
[Speaker 2]: That's about it and my mother has breast cancer about 10 years ago but she's been in remission for several years now. I think other than that I can't think of any other illness or cancers that run in my family 

03:23:98
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. So a family history of cancer especially colorectal cancer and breast cancer can increase your risk for developing certain cancers. But now let's talk about your social history. Do you drink or smoke?

03:55:100
[Speaker 2]: I don't smoke and i quit about 10 years ago but i do drink on occasional events 

04:06:02
[Speaker 1]: That's great. Quiting smoking can be significantly reduce your of developing several types of cancer. Now let's move on to allergies. Do you have known allergies either to medications or other substance?

04:29:99
[Speaker 2]: No. I don't have any known allergies. I have never had any issues with medication or anything else like that 

04:38:01
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. Now based on your symptoms and family history and social history there are few possible conditions that could be causing these symptoms. One possibility as you mentioned is colorectal cancer and other possibility include  inflammatory bowel disease, polyps or hemorrhoids and diverticulosis. To confirm all these conditions i would like to have some test including colonoscopy and blood test 

05:21:00
[Speaker 2]: A colonoscopy sounds a bit intimidating. Can you tell me more about what it involves? And what you expect to find? 

05:33:98
[Speaker 1]: I understand your concern and i may know a colonoscopy is a procedure where a flexible tube and a camera is inserted through the rectum and into the colon. You know, to examine of the large intestine. So it is very common and safe procedure that is used to screen for and diagnosed for colon and rectum condition. So i expect to find the cause of your symptoms whether it is cancer, polyps or something else. So you see during the colonoscopy if we find any polyps or areas of concern, we can remove small samples of the tissue for further examination. This is known as biopsy. We can also take biopsies of any abnormal looking areas in the colon lining. So to sample will then be sent to a lab for analysis to determine if they are cancerous or benign 

06:44:03
[Speaker 2]: What will happen if biopsy result shows that i have cancer doctor?

06:52:02
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Excuse me, if the biopsy results comes back as positive for cancer then we will discuss the best treatment options for you 

07:08:98
[Speaker 2]: Thank you for answering all my questions doctor. I feel a bit more informed now but also more nervous about the possibility of a cancer

07:20:01
[Speaker 1]: I understand how you feel but remember that catching any potential issues early can make a big difference. I am here to support you through this process and i will schedule the test and i will take one step at a time. So please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns 

07:45:02

I'm not fine. My daughter is not fine, So I'm not fine. So what's…what's wrong with her? She started running temperature yesterday, started running temperature yesterday and then I checked, I checked the temperature it was, it was about 38.1°C at home and then today she…she started jerking her arms and her legs. So the complaint, so the complaint is the fever and the jerking of the hands and legs. So when the fever started, was it like low grade? I just noticed that her body was, her body was very hot. It was very hot. So I decided to check with my thermometer at home and it was 38.1. OK, 38.1 OK. Did you did you use any…was there anything you did that like, brought the fever down? Did you give her anything at all to bring the fever down? I...I know that we needed, we needed to like clean her body with water. So still on the fever, I'll like to ask you other few questions. She was not coughing. She was not coughing at any point. She was not coughing. OK, alright cool. Did you notice any discharge from her ear or from her nose or her eyes, anything like that at all? I have not noticed anything. OK, OK cool. She…she never gave any complaints like that. Although, she…she really does not have appetite now because she's not been eating well since the fever started. She's not been eating well. She never complained of…of pain in her throat when… OK, is there…OK that's fine. There was no vomiting at all. There was no vomiting. OK, Did you notice that she was passing any loose stool? Was she going to the toilet frequently and was passing loose stool? Anything like that? She…the only thing that I noticed was that she usually cries when she wants to Asides that, she was not stooling she was not vomiting. I don't know what is going on, doctor. OK, cool, cool. I was getting to that too. I don't know if she feels pain, but she says she's usually crying, usually crying when she wants to urinate, Alright. Usually…usually…usually for her age, usually in children that like, cannot properly express emotions, so, most of the time…most of the time…most of the time, when a child is crying, when she pees, it's most likely due to pain, right? OK. You think the…the pain she's feeling what is causing that fever? So I'm…I'm…I'm getting to it. I'm getting to it. OK. Okay, so the jerky movement, right? Everything was fine. Everything was fine. like how long, how long did it last for? Like how long did you see that… It lasted about…lasted about 3 minutes or thereabout. OK, cool It only happened once, it only happened once immediately afterwards, I brought her immediately to the hospital to see the doctor. OK, cool, Beautiful. So it happened just once, right. I'm as shocked, 'cause this is the first time I'm seeing something like this happen. OK, OK, All right, All right, cool. Yes, She's my first daughter, yes First daughter, and I make sure that she gets all her  immunization. I don't know,  what's going on. You said she…she has…erm immunization. Yes, I have the card, I make sure I take her to get all the immunization. And when she was younger, there was… She had no complications… when she was, when she was there, when she was… when she was newly delivered, like, you know, during her like her first one month or after she was…after… after delivery, there wasn't…She had no, like any type of yellowness of the eyes. No, there was, there was nothing, nothing like that. There was nothing, everything was fine. And she did not have she… And she cried immediately after birth, or it took a while for that to happen? She cried immediately. OK. OK. All right. Cool. Nothing, Nothing at all. Her pregnancy and antenatal, everything was fine, she delivered by herself. OK and she delivered herself, right? Yes OK. OK So, erm OK, so cool from the…everything I've asked you right now… And how old is your daughter, too, by the way? Just to be sure She …I said she’s 3… She's 3. She's 3 years old. Alright, so from everything I've asked you, OK, three. Doctor, her own lasted…her own lasted about 3 minutes. So you mean she was convulsing? Yes she had an episode of convulsion but was a single…it was a singular episode and the cause of…and the cause of the…of the convulsion is due to some bacterial infection that manifested as fever. So that's what brings us to the complaints about her having the…having… crying when she was peeing. So the focus of the fever could come from like the urinary tract infection. So in this case, to properly investigate and get to the root of the matter, to properly treat her, right. So she would need to do some basic investigations, the first things first in this case of fever is to do a full blood count. I hope…I hope she is not going to have another convulsion before then, ‘cause I am really scared. No No No…Based on, based on the fact that…based on…based on everything I've asked you, no, don't worry, she’ll be fine. how are we going to take care of the convulsion now? ‘cause I’m really scared No, so as soon as the results of the… of the labs we do is out, so we'll... we'll just try and treat the UTI, we'll place her on antibiotics, right. So, the antibiotics will take care of the urinary tract infection. But you said the result will take about 72 hours, that's like 3 days. no, first… so the…the result of the urinalysis too, if the…if we…if we can pick out any positive from the urinalysis, we can start her on some erm… some antibiotics first, pending the time the urine MCS comes out right. But her temperature is still quite high. I just… I still checked recently before… before coming. Yeah. Yeah. We also take care of that. We'll give… we'll give her antipyretics for that. You're sure she's going to be fine? Yes, she'll be fine for sure, for sure. Then, I hope this is not going to happen again What did you say? I can't hear you properly, I hope it’s not going to happen again it's…so far…the thing is, so far the causative organism, so far the cause, the cause is not in play, then it will likely not happen again. Doctor, I try my possible best to do that. As you know urinary tract infections are ubiquitous. No problem, Doctor. Thank you very much.

Just to the solution. She's three. She's three. She's three. Alright, so from everything I've asked, okay, three. Alright. And so everything I've asked you, right, I have a picture of what's might be wrong with your daughter, right? So from everything I've, I'd have to sign up together. It's looking like it's a case of um, febrile convulsion, right? And she's very good. Is that your cause um at this age and is it just a convulsion that just is a singular event that lasts less than fifteen seconds in like twenty four hours right properly or every that cause i only lasted i only lasted about three minutes or so you mean she was convulsing yes she had an episode of convulsion but was a single was a single episode and the cause of and the cause of the of the conversion is due to some bacterial infection that's manifested as fever so that's what brings us to the complaints about um having having crying when she was paying so the focus of the fever could have come from like the urinary tract infection so in this case to properly investigate and get to the root of the matter to properly treat that right so she needs to do some basic investigation the first things first in this case of fever is to do a full blood count full blood count is like a complete body workup that will show us if there's any ongoing systemic infection right then the other thing to properly point out to the u t i to that we can that what i'm kind of trying to i'm querying as a cause of the febrile convulsion is the fact that we need to also do a urine analysis right you do your analysis and also you need to do a urine m c s m c s means microscopic culture we're just trying to like culture the urine to pick out um the bacterial infection that can be causing the fever and subsequently the confusion that she had usually that's one the united system is like an immediate immediate instant report but the um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um No, no, no. Based on based on the fact that based on based on everything I've asked you, no, don't worry, you should be fine based on everything I've asked you is in line with the conversion, right? But it's line of feedback conversion. So if we take care of the cause of the fever, right, usually the convulsion will appear. And usually common for children less than five years, is it? No, so as soon as the results of the So, let us try and treat the UTI, we'll place that on the tri. So that's about it, so we'll take care of the, the next track. So, if we can pick out any positive from the analysis, we can start on some. Some antibiotics first, pending the time the N. M. C. S. comes out, then when the N. M. C. S. comes out, we will check the sensitivity to any antibiotics with more sensitivity, if it's the one that we started with, we will continue with it, but if we see one that is more sensitive to the bacteria that we cultured, right, we will just switch to that one, then it should be fine, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, we also think that we will give you We will give her antibiotics for that. We will give antibiotics for that and the pressure will come down. You're sure she's going to be fine? Yes, she will be fine for sure. I'm pretty sure you brought her to the right place and we will take care of her properly. Thank you. I hope she doesn't wake up. What did you say? I can't hear you properly. It's so far the thing is so far the the costive organism so far the cost the cost is not in play then it's like no application so just like properly just this is just this is a general um um medical advice to make sure that she's eating well um just like properly be healthy proper general healthy living basically yeah i try my possible best to do that my my child is always healthy i feel when it is time she eats three times a day she has snacks in between so i don't know i make sure she washes and i have often so how could she have gotten the infection an infection you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know So just basically basic hygiene, personal hygiene, since the course is from a university, so personal hygiene, make sure that she the she's properly takes care of herself, or she's probably taking care of her in that area basically, so the case of personal hygiene and stuff. No problem, doctor. Thank you very much. I really appreciate your help."," Good morning, sir. Good morning, doctor. Yes, sir. How are you doing today? How's the way of you today? I'm not fine. My daughter is not fine. I'm not fine. So what's wrong with her? I can't see her. What's wrong with her? What's the complaint exactly? She started running temperature yesterday. Started running temperature yesterday. And then I checked the temperature. It was about 38.1 degrees Celsius. And then today she started jerking her arms and legs I'm really worried doctor so the complaint is the fever and the jerking of the arms we'll start with the fever I want to ask a few questions about the fever so when the fever started was it like low grade? was it like just mildly hot? or she was very hot and she was like shivering? I just noticed that her body was very hot. It was very hot. So I decided to check with my thermometer and it was 38.1. Okay. 38.1. Okay. Did you use anything you did that brought the fever down? Did you give anything at all to brought the fever down? I know that we needed to clean her body with water. I cleaned her body with warm water to reduce the temperature. She was still very hot overnight until this morning. morning so still only few I would like to ask so that's your question so was she coughing at any point she was not coughing she was not coughing at any point she was not coughing okay did you notice any discharge from her ear or from her nose or her eyes anything like that at all I have not noticed anything okay okay did you actually ever complain to you that um she had some pain when she was eating when she was swallowing is she giving that kind of complaint that she feels something like truth when she swallowed she she never gave any complaints like that although she she really don't have a bit tight now because she's not been eating well since the fever started. She's not been eating well. She never complained of pain in her throat. Okay. Okay, that's fine. Did she, in the midst, around after the fever, did she vomit? Any vomiting at all? There was no vomiting at all. There was no vomiting. Okay. Did you notice that she was passing any loose stool? Was she going to the toilet frequently and was passing loose stool? Anything like that? The only thing that I noticed was that she usually cries when she wants to pee. When she wants to urinate. She's usually crying. Aside that she was not stooping, she was not meeting. I don't know what's going on, doctor. Okay, cool. I was getting to that. Now, you said she was having, when she goes to pee, she feels pain when she pees, right? I don't know if she feels pain or not, but she says she's usually crying. She usually cries when she wants to eat. When she's just there. Usually for her age, usually in children that cannot properly express emotions. So most of the time, most of the time, most of the time, when a child is crying, when she pees, it's likely due to pain. And based on what you have been telling me since, I'm like, the picture is making more sense. So I'd like to ask you a few questions. Do you think the pain she's feeling is what is causing her fever? So I'm getting to it. I'm getting to it. Do you mind me asking some other questions from you? Okay. Okay. So the Jackie movement, right? Can you describe it for me how do you look like everything was fine everything was fine i just went to do something and then i'm coming back i saw her moving her arms and her legs in folding it for a couple of minutes it lasted about three minutes. How long did it last for? How long did you see that story? It lasted about three minutes. How long did it last for? It lasted about three minutes or thereabouts. It was for quite a while. And then after that was... Okay, cool. And in the last few hours, how many times has it happened? How many times has she had that jerky movement? How many times checking movement? It only happened once. It only happened once. Afterwards I brought her immediately to Joss. Okay cool, beautiful. So it happened just once right? Alright. And as this as this as this as this happened as this checking movement, has it happened before in the past is this happening is it the first time you guys are missing that kind of thing i'm not shocked because this is the first time i'm saying something like this okay all right all right cool so um all right all right um she's she's your first um daughter right? What's her position in the family? She's my first daughter. My first daughter. And I make sure that she gets all my immunizations. I don't know what's going on. You said she had immunizations. Was there like a card? Yes, I have the card. I make sure she takes all the immunizations. So you're sure she got all the immunizations? Yes, I'm very I make sure she takes her to take her to the hospital. So you are sure she got all the immunizations when she was there? Yes, I am very sure. I take my daughter's health seriously. And when she was younger, she had no complications. When she was newly delivered, during her first one month or after she was delivered after delivery she had no like any type of illness or the eyes no there was there was nothing nothing like that there was nothing everything was fine and she did not have she no okay and she cried immediately after that or it took a while for that to happen? She cried immediately. Everything was fine with her. She discharged the same day. Okay. Alright. And when your wife was pregnant, she had no complications? She wasn't admitted? Nothing like that? Nothing. Nothing at all. Her pregnancy and everything was fine. She delivered by herself. Okay. She delivered by herself. She delivered herself, right? Yes. Okay. So, so, cool. So, from the everything I've asked you right now, and how old is your daughter too, by the way? She's three. She's three. She's three. All right. So from everything I've asked you, I have a picture of what might be wrong with your daughter, right? So from everything I've signed up together, it's looking like it's a case of um fibra conversion right and she's really watching your questions is that your cause um at this agent is series of conversion that's yours is a singular event that lasts less than 15 seconds in like 24 hours, right? Properly ruled out. Or if there are costs. Our own lasted... that lasts less than 15 seconds, like in 24 hours, right? Properly ruled out. I only lasted about three minutes. So you mean she was convulsing? Yes, she had an episode of convulsion, but it was a singular episode. And the cause of the convulsion is due to some bacterial infection that manifested as a fever. So that's what brings us to the complaints about her having crying when she was pained. So the focus of the fever could have come from like the urinary tract infection. So in this case, to properly investigate and get the root of the matter, to properly treat that, right? So you need to do some basic investigations. The first thing first in this case of fever is to do a full blood count. Full blood count is like a complete body workup that shows if there's any ongoing systemic infection, right? Then the other thing to probably point out to the UTI, but i'm quite trying to i'm querying as a cause of the fibromyalgia conversion is the fact that we need to also do a reanalysis right so you do analysis and also you need to do a urine mcs mcs means microscopic cultural sensitivity we're just trying to like culture the urine to pick out um the bacteria infection that can be causing the fever and subsequently the conversion that she had usually that's one the analysis is like an immediate immediate um instant um report but the unimcs takes like about 72 hours for it to be ready. So in this case... I don't know if you've heard of another conversion people there. I'm really scared. Based on the fact that... Based on everything I've asked you... No, don't worry. You should be fine. Based on everything I've asked you, it's in line with your conversion, right? But it's in line with your conversion. So if we take care of the cause of the fever right usually the conversion will happen and usually common for children less than five years so as soon as the results of the of the labs we do is out so we'll also try and treat UTI. We will place her on antibiotics. So the antibiotics will take care of the urinary tract. So the results will take about 2 hours. That's like 3 days. Are we going to do 3 days? No, first, the results of the analysis, if we can pick out any positive from the analysis, we can start on some antibiotics first, depending on the time the UNMCS comes out. Then when the UNMCS comes out, we will check the sensitivity. So any antibiotics with small sensitivity. If it's the one that we started with, it's continuity. So, well, if it it. If we see someone that's more sensitive to the bacteria that we cultured, we'll just switch to that one. Then she'll be fine. But the temperature is still quite high. I just checked with her before. Yeah, we'll also take care of that. We'll give her antibiotics for that. We'll give her antibiotics for that and the temperature will come down. Are you sure she's going to be fine? Yes, she will be fine for sure. I'm very sure. You brought her to the right place and we will take care of her properly. Thank you. I hope she's not waking up. What did you say? I can't hear properly. I hope she's not going to wake up. the thing is so far the court the custody organism so far the course the course is not in play then it's like not again so just like properly just um this is just this is general um um medical advice just make sure that she's eating well, just like properly be healthy, proper general healthy living basically.

OK, so we have a thyroid gland that's located in our neck and the anterior part of our neck that helps with our body metabolism. It helps to keep our body regulation in check, you understand. So, it produces some hormones and, in that case, it looks like one of the hormones is overproduced. means it's produced more than what it should produce. That is why it's given some of the symptoms you've complained of today. What I would need to do for you is I'm going to carry out some investigations for you. It's… first investigation is going to be the thyroid function test which we're going to look at all the thyroid hormones to be sure If the hormone is actually… there's an imbalance in the thyroid hormones, then I'm also… all right. I'm also going to do just in thyroid scan just look at the thyroid gland in case there's an enlargement, although you did mention that there's no neck swelling, but it'll also be good to also have a look at thyroid grand OK.

So we'll carry out all these tests and given your age and and well I think after we do the thyroid gland, it might not be out of place to also do you know maybe a just an aspiration of the thyroid gland But I think we should do the scan first and whatever the result says we would know what to do further from there. But pending the time, I'm going to place you on some beta blockers just to, you know, relieve the palpitations that you are feeling. OK OK, So I'm going to write out some prescriptions for you just to… so that you don't stay… it’ll stop, it’ll reduce the anxiety and the palpitations you're feeling, like atenolol and then I'm also going to give you some antithyroid drugs as well. All right. All right. I hope they're not too expensive. Oh, not at all. But I would write them out for you. So, do you have any other questions? No, no, for now.

Basically, from all that you've… you've told me so far, I have been able to gather that it is very likely that you have a stroke, although this has been going on for four hours, so we're not so sure whether it's permanent or not. So, it could either be a stroke or a transient ischemic attack. Both are basically almost the same thing, the only difference is the time with which they present and for now it's been about four hours at less than a day. So, it's still possible that it might reverse. So basically, what I want to do first is to send you for a test to know whether it's actually a stroke or not. So, you're going to be doing a scan, right? OK And this scan will tell us what kind of stroke, if it's a stroke, what kind of stroke is it? Because basically I have two types. Sorry, I didn't get that. What? What type of scan am I doing, Sir? Yes, you are going to do a CT scan. OK. Yes, you’re going to do a CT scan. My whole body? No, just your head. So, it's a scan that just gives us an image of what's going on in your head. We want to know whether any vessel ruptured, or any vessel is being blocked. Are you with me, Sir? I’m with you, Sir. All right, so that scan, you're going to tell us whether a vessel is being blocked or a vessel ruptured each. Both scenarios can present with similar symptoms, and so the scan is important for us to be able to differentiate between the two. However, then we'll still place you on oxygen and monitor your vitals very closely. Are you with me, Sir? Yes, I'm here. I'm with you, Sir. So, the results of the scan would determine the next line of management. So, if it is a… if it is a ischemic stroke would most likely want to place you on some anticoagulants and thrombolytic agents to break down the blood clots that is causing occlusion. However, if it is a… if it's an hemorrhagic stroke, we would want to place you on an antihypertensive that will make sure that the hemorrhage does not get worse. But it is very important that you go for that scan as soon as possible so that the condition does not worsen, and hopefully if it is not a stroke, we are hoping that some of these symptoms would reverse. Do you understand? Can I do the scan tomorrow? No, you can't. It's today as soon as possible. OK Sir. Yes please. So, do you have any questions for me? No, Sir, not at all. You've answered all my questions. All right, All right. That's great. So that would be the end for today's consultation. All right. Thank you, Doctor.

Was there at any point that you… you had an injury on that side of the leg? No at all. I never had any… any injury or any accident or any former… none none of nothing, nothing like that. I just noticed it recently, just recently, just noticed that it started happening. I was very, very… I was agile, I was, I was usually… I worked as a erm… traffic… traffic control officer and I just retired. So I've been up and doing for a… while. So I just noticed this recently. just about two weeks ago. So what's your weight, Please Sir, I think I'm about, about… about 70 KG around… around. Last time I checked, 70 KG OK And your height? Do you know your height? I'm not really sure about my height, to be honest. I'm not really sure about my height, but I know I'm not up to 6 ft When you, when you wake up in the morning, when you wake up in the morning, do you feel any stiffness or pain in the leg? Do you feel stiffness in the, in the, in that in your knee? Not really, not really, Just… Just the sharp pain, especially when I try to walk. When I try to use the knee You don't feel stiffness, you don't feel stiffness in your knee in the morning when you wake up? No No after you sit for a while, after you immobilize the leg for a while, and you're not using the leg, the knee for a while, when you try to stand up from a chair, do you feel some stiffness or serious pain in the leg? Yes, I Yeah, I feel, I feel something like that, Yes. When you're sleeping at night, do you feel pain in the leg? No, No. OK, has this pain occurred before on that same part of the leg or in any other part of your body? Not at all, not at all. I have no pain and I don't feel any pain. I feel good in other part of my body but it's just for that and the leg, the pain… the pain in my knee, it was just recently. Before then I was I was OK, I was fine. When, when you're walking do you hear some cracky sounds when you're walking? Sometimes I… I think I've had one of my because I'm I'm about 60 year old so I think one of my children told me months that kind of heard something like that when I when I walked past him, I don't know but I've, I've not really felt something like that, but I think about someone say something like that about it. The range of the range of movement of your joint, is it still the same? Are you in any way limited in the range of your… of the movement of your joint? Yes, yes, because of the pain, yes OK, no problem. Erm, I will just ask you some questions. Are you diabetic or hypertensive? No, I'm not. Do you have any medical condition that you think the doctor showed know about? No. Do you have the, have you had any previous surgeries? Yeah, Yeah. Erm, just about.. just the appendectomy I had about 30 years ago. 30 Years ago. OK, Do you smoke or drink alcohol? I used to when I was much younger. I used to smoke, used to smoke, but I stopped smoking and I take alcohol once in a while. What kind of alcohol do you take? Do you take beer or… or spirits or whiskey? I take, I take more of beer. You take more of beer. OK, OK. So like, how many bottles do you take per day? I’m, I'm a social drinker. I only take, I only take alcohol on like social events just once in a while. No, no, no problem. Is there any fever? Not at all. Not at all. OK, no problem. Do you have any drug allergies? I only react, I only react to a particular type of antibiotics, to penicillin. I was told yes. That's all… React to Penicillins. OK, there is no problem. Is there anything else you want the doctor to know about? Doctor, other than my knee, I'm fine. I just want to know what's wrong with my knee and to get a proper solution to it Just to, just to have an holistic, holistic erm… erm… assessment of of my patients. I'd like to ask some other questions. So I want to ask you, do you have headaches? Any loss of consciousness? Not at all. OK, Do you have chest pain? No. At all. Any difficulty in breathing? No. Do you hear your heart beat fast? Not at all. Do you have any abdominal pain? Abdominal pain? No, No. Yes. No at all. Yeah, Any diarrhea? No. OK Do you have pain when you want to urinate or difficulty urinating? No. No, doctor. No. OK Are there times that you see crystals in your urine? When you say crystal, what do you mean by crystal, doctor? Like, like some stones. Small, small, small stones in your urine. I think I, recent… sometime ago, yes, I saw something that looks like what you describe, but I wasn't sure what it was. So,  I thought it is because I didn't take enough water. So, I think I took more water and I've not seen it in a while. So, but I think I remember seeing something like what you described once. There's no problem. So I'm going to go ahead and do a general examination on you just to check your if your pale, to check if you're jaundiced, to check if you're well hydrated, to check your lymph nodes. And then I'm also going to specially examine your… your knee to know the exact cause of the pain you're having to see if there's anything we can pick up that will help us in your management for this knee pain that you're having, do you understand? So, it will involve us examining the knee, moving the knee might make you a bit uncomfortable because of the pain you're having there. We want to see whether there's a swelling, whether there's a increase in the warmth of that place compared to your other knee, because I want to see whether it's tender, that is, it's it's very painful on on on pressing it, or whether the pain is only there when you want to move. And we also want to see if there's any cracking sound when we move the joints. Do you understand? So we think it could be an osteoarthritis which means the wear and tear of the joints of the knee which will now start causing pain with that. And then because of your history of drinking beer and then history of passing some stones in your urine, you think you could have also have a gouty arthritis in your in your knee. So we're going to run some investigations to to know the exact cause and the management to to put in place. We are going to need to do an X-ray of that leg, of the leg, lhat will involve seeing both joints, the joints above and the joints below, right. And then we are also going to request for some other blood tests like a complete blood count, a full block count to see if it's an effective process which could be a septic arthritis. And then we also need to do the erythrocyte sedimentation rates to show us whether there's an, it's an inflammatory process going on. It could be elevated in an inflammatory process and then we'll do a uric acid test. So, you know if your uric acid level is high which could be a sign of a guilty arthritis. Do you understand and after after the investigations we are going to start you, we are going to start you on some drugs to relieve your pain, but the main, mainstay of the treatment is going to be non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, I wanted to ask earlier, but do you have ulcer, are you a known peptic ulcer disease patients, No not at all OK because some of the drugs that we are going to give you could… could exacerbate peptic ulcer disease. So, we're going to give you some non steroidal anti inflammation drugs like ibuprofen, we can give you diclofenac, do you understand? And then we are going to give you some gel that you can apply topically for pain relief gel that you can apply topically that will help relieve the pain. All in all, if it's osteoarthritis where it's caused by wear and tear, you have to limit the usage of of that joint because the more you use the joint the more the wear and tear happens. There are other modalities of treatment, but it depends on the progression and how bad the, the knee, The knee is. Do you understand? it could involve replacement of the knee but depending on grade on how, of the osteoarthritis, do you understand what I'm saying? And then if it's a gouty arthritis would have to start you on some other drugs that would reduce the level of uric acid in your in your system and also relieve your… your pain. Do you understand? So that is that is what we're going to do. Do you have any questions for me, Sir? All right. So after all this is done, the pain, my pain, will… will it be, will it… Will it go away or do I have to live with this for the rest of my life or I don't, I'm trying to understand what, what is what, What is the prognosis of this going forward? If it is, if it is a, if it is the osteoarthritis. Like I said earlier, it's wear and tear. Do you understand? So the pain will come, but whenever you use your, your drugs, it's going to go away. It's going to go away for some time, but you might have to be on those drugs for some time. Do you understand? if it's a guilty arthritis. If you're uric acid level in the body is low, the pain is going to go and then will also treat you with the with the pain relief. But you have to stay away from… from some things like stop eating offals, you reduce the amount of beer you take. If you can stop fine. Do you understand? but we'll give you some drugs that will lower the level of your uric acid. Do you understand? So that is the modality of treatment for for it. Any other questions? Oh, I think that's fine. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much for your time.",924.256,med-convo-nig,"Good afternoon, sir. My name is Dr. Shadekar. How may I help you? Yeah, good afternoon, doctor.

I thought it was because I didn't take enough water so I think I took on water and I have not seen it anymore so I think I remember seeing something like what you described once. All right, there's no problem. So I'm going to go ahead and do a general examination on you, just to check your, if you're a pill, to check if you're a jaundiced, to check if you're well hydrated, to check your lymph nodes. And then I'm also going to specially examine your knee to know the exact cause of the pain you're having, to see if there's anything we can pick up that will help us in your management for this knee pain that you're having. Do you understand? So to involve us examining the knee, removing the knee, might make you a bit uncomfortable because of the pain you're having there. I want to see whether there's a swelling, whether there's an increase in the warmth of that place compared to your other knee. I want to to see whether it's tender, whether it's very painful on pressing it, or whether the pain is only there when you want to move. And we also want to see if there's any cracking sound when we move the joint. Do you understand? And so we think it could be an osteoarthritis, which means the wear and tear of the joints of the knee, which will now start causing pain later. And then because of your history of drinking beer and then history of passing some stones in your urine, you think you could also have a gouty arthritis in your knee. So I'm going to run some investigations to know the exact cause and the management to put in place. We are going to need to do an x-ray of that leg, of the leg that we involved seeing both joints, the joints above and the joints below, right? And then we are also going to request for some other blood tests like a complete blood count a full blood count to see if it's an effective process which could be a septic arthritis and then we also need to do the um erythrocytes and sedimentation rates to show us whether there's an inflammatory process going on it could be elevated in an inflammatory process test And then we'll do a uric acid test to know if your uric acid level is high, which could be a sign of a gouty arthritis. Do you understand? And after the investigations, we are going to start you on some drugs to relieve your pain. But the mainstay of the treatment is going to be non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. I wanted to ask Eliaboh, do you have ulcer? Are you a non-peptic ulcer disease patient? Okay, because some of the drugs that we are going to give you could could exacerbate peptic ulcer disease. So we are going to give you some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that are able to fail. I can give you diclofenac, do you understand? And they are going to give you some gel that you can apply topically, some pain relief gel that you can apply topically that will help relieve the pain. Only know if it's osteoarthritis, it's caused by re-altere, you have to limit the usage of that joint because the more you use the joint, the more the re-altere happens. There are other modalities of treatment, but it depends on the progression and how bad the knee is. It could involve replacement of the knee, but do you understand? It could involve replacement of the knee, but depending on the rate of the osteoarthritis, do you understand what I'm saying? And then if it's a gouty arthritis, you would have to start using some other drugs that would reduce the level of uric acid in your system and also relieve your pain. Do you understand? So that is what we are going to do. Do you have any questions for me, sir? Alright, so after all this is done, my pain, will it go away or do I have to live with this for the rest of my life? I'm trying to understand. What is the diagnosis of this going forward? If it is the osteoarthritis, like I said earlier, it's wear and tear. Do you understand? So the pain will come, but whenever you use your drugs, it's going to go away. And it's going to go away for some time, but you might have to be on those drugs for some time. Do you understand? if it's a gouty arthritis, if your uric acid level in the body is low, the pain is going to go. And they will also treat you with the peri-lepore. You have to stay away from some things like stop eating off-hours, reduce the amount of beer you take. If you can't stop, fine. Do you understand? Or we'll give you some drugs that will lower the level of your uric acid do you understand so that is the modality of treatment for it any other question from us oh i think that's fine thank you doctor thank you very much for your time"

My… my… even when I was coughing, my chest was not paining me nothing it was just the cough then I… I discovered after a few days after that I just started running temperature too. My body was very, very hot. It was very hot that I was shivering. So, you're telling me there is no, there is no cough, there is no chest pain. No, there's… there's no chest pain, my chest was not paining me at all. Your chest was not paining me. Is there anybody coughing around you? No, there nobody.

So, OK, so you stay alone. You're not here in an overcrowded place. Yes, but yes. But Doctor, I noticed. What actually prompted me to come is the fact that about two days ago I noticed that the cough became worsened, and I was… I started to have some difficulty in breathing. So, like that got me really scared, like I was, I was, I was just feeling breathless for a moment. Comes and goes then, and since that, since then, the breathlessness has become more worsened.

No, it's not associated with erm, any… any position, nothing. I just… it just comes and goes, like I just feel breathless for a while, then it relieves me. Then it comes again, especially when I'm especially when I'm coughing. OK. Has this worsened progressively? Yes, Yes… It has gotten very bad, doctor, that's why I came to the hospital. Does it affect, does it affect your daily activities? Yes, it does, doctor. I've not been able to work for the past two days because of the cough and the fact that I have, I've not been feeling well, generally in my body, so that's so, Now this fever that you were having, was it… did it start suddenly or gradually? It started. It started gradually, then became I became very hot and it has been like that, it has been like that. So, the fever is high grade, You're very hot? Yes… Yes, it's high. Did you at any point? Yes. Check by yourself at home your temperature?

Has anything happened before in the past? OK, Has it happened in the past? No, no, no, no. This is the first time I'm experiencing, that's why I'm… this is the first time I'm experiencing this kind of thing. OK, this is the first time. Are you.. do you have any medical condition? Like, are you asthmatic during your blood group and genotype? No, I'm not doctor, I'm fine. No, I have nothing. And that’s why this is Surprising. Are you hypertensive? What did you say? I can't hear you properly, Sir. Are you hypertensive or diabetic? None. None. None. None No, no. I have none of them… I have none of them. So, what have you... what have you done to care for yourself so far? I just… I just… I just tried to get some cough syrup, but they didn't… They didn't seem to work properly. They didn't seem to work and since the difficulty breathing started, I knew, I knew, I know I needed to like, come to speak to someone, to a doctor. So, that's why I came today, for you to like, for me to like, know what's wrong with me and treat myself, basically. Have you been, have you been admitted before? No, not, not, not that I can remember. Have you done any surgical procedure before? No, No. OK. So, I'm just going to ask you some other questions just to know what exactly could be related to your, to the symptoms you're having. So, do you have headache? Headache just comes once in a while, maybe 'cause the cough. I've not been able to sleep really. So, kind of, yeah, kind of, yes. OK. So, any loss of consciousness? No. No. No, No. OK, OK.

It's just, it's just the shortest of breath I've been having. The difficulty in breathing I've been having. That's just, that's just… So, in summary you're telling me, in summary you're telling me you had, you… you've had cough, fever and difficulty in breathing. Yes. Right and your cough is productive. Yes. All right, So I'm going to have to have to examine you, right. I'm going to have to examine you and I'm going to have to listen to your chest to know if, to know whatever is going on in your chest, whether there's a chest infection that is causing you to have a fever and the and the cough. Do you understand? And then we are going to have you do some investigations like a chest X-ray, a complete blood count, a full blood count which will tell us whether there's an infection going on, depending on the parameters that are elevated or reduced, do you understand? We are going to do you know, electrocyte segmentation rates to know whether there's an inflammatory process going on. Do you understand? And then we're also going to take your sputum, your… the phlegm and we're going to send it for culture, sensitivity to know what bacteria is, is being cultured. Erm, please, I just want to ask you, do you smoke? No. No, I don't, doctor, I'm a good Christian. I don’t smoke. I don't drink. You don't… You don't drink alcohol either. I don't, I don't do any of those, I don't do drugs, I don't do any of that. I'm going to ask you some other questions. Do you have… their kind of personal questions? Can I go ahead? Yeah. I just want to know, doctor, I just want to… I just want to be fine. I just want to know how soon you can start treating me and what I’ll need to take basically.

So, we are going to start you, from the history and the examination we have done and then we're going to ask you to do some investigations. However, we have some differentials like diagnosis, the cause, the cause of what is causing the cough and the fever. We have some, this thing at the back of our mind, which could be the cause. Do you understand? We think you have a pneumonia, pneumonia, a chest infection. So, we're going to start you on a broad spectrum antibiotics, right? And then we're going to start you on the cough syrup, right, to treat the cough while we wait for the results of our investigations. Do you understand? OK And then since there's no history of asthma by the time you'll start treatment with the antibiotics and… and the cough syrup there will be… the breathlessness is going to reduce. But we… your... we would have checked your… your oxygen saturation and we'll see that it is fine. So, there'll be no need to place you on… on oxygen. So, you're going to have you do a full blood count in sputum and microscopy culture sensitivity. You're going to have you do any Erythrocyte segmentation rate and you're going to do a chest X-ray. So, let's see if it's a structural problem or a functional problem. Do you understand? OK, doctor. So doctor, do I.. Do you want to ask the question if you have any questions, Yes, I was going to ask that are you going to keep me in the hospital or do I… that… can I… can I be treated from home? Because I don't know. We, we, we are going to admit you for some time to evaluate you and because of the breathlessness you are having, right. And then we'll start you on on intravenous, intravenous… erm That's OK. That's cool. Culture and sensitivity could take about 72 hours to.. to five days before it will be ready. Do you understand? Yeah, no problem, Doctor. Thank you. No problem, Doctor. Thank you very much. I think that's fine. I will just, yeah, I'll just do the labs and wait for just for you to start the treatment. Thank you.",794.144,med-convo-nig,"Good afternoon, sir. I am Doctor Shadak. Good afternoon, good afternoon, doctor. How are you doing today, sir? Doctor, I'm not, I'm not too fine, not too fine.

So that's the summary you're telling me, in summary you're telling me you had, you've had cough, fever and difficulty in breathing, yes, right, and your cough is productive, yes. Alright, so I'm going to have to have to examine you, right? I'm going to have to examine you, and I'm going to have to listen to your chest to know, to know whatever is going on in your chest. there's a chest infection that is causing you to have a fever and the and the cough do you understand and then we are going to have you do some investigations like a chest x-ray a complete blood count or a full blood count to tell us whether there's an infection going on depending on the parameters that are elevated or reduced do you understand we are going to do a neutrophil segmentation rate to know whether there's an inflammatory process brain on do you understand and then we're also going to take your sputum your the phlegm and we're going to um send it for culture sensitivity to know what bacteria is uh is being cultured um please i just want to ask you do you smoke no no i don't so doctor i'm a good christian i don't smoke i don't drink you don't you don't drink alcohol either i don't i don't do any of those i don't do jobs i don't do any of that i'm going to ask you some other questions um do you have um there are kind of personal questions can i go ahead yeah i just want to know doctor i just want to i just want to be fine i just want to know how soon you can start treating me and what i don't want to ask if i don't want to ask if you have multiple sexual partners and your sexual practices no no Oral sex.

And then, since there's no history of asthma, by the time you start treatments with the antibiotics and the cough syrup, there'll be the breathlessness. business is going to reduce but we your we would have checked your oxygen saturation and we see that it is fine so there'll be no need to place you on on oxygen so you're against having you do full block out in um um sputum and end microscopic culture sensitivity are going to have you doing the enteric site sedimentation rates and are going to do a chest x-ray so let's see if it's structural problem or a functional problem do you understand Okay. Do you want to ask a question? Do you have any questions? Yes, I was going to ask that, are you going to keep me in your hospital or do I have to go home? Can I be treated from home? Because I don't know. We are going to admit you for some time to evaluate you and because of the breathlessness you are having, right? Okay, that's fine. So thank you very much i think that's fine i will just yeah i will just do the laps and wait for is for you to start the treatment. Thank you."," Good afternoon, sir. I am Dr. Shadekoff.

And I walk too, there is nobody coughing around me so okay so you stay in the room you're not in a crowded place yes but yes but doctor i noticed what actually tell me to come is the fact that about two days ago i noticed that the cough became worsened and i was i said to have some difficulty in breathing. So that got me really scared. I was feeling breathless for a moment. And since then, the breathlessness has become more worsened. So that's what exactly prompted me to come quickly to see you. You're finding it difficult to breathe? Yes. When you sleep at night, do you sweat excessively? No, at all. I don't sweat. So what relieves the breathlessness? Any changing position that relieves the breathlessness or is it constant, it's not associated with any position or nothing. It just comes and goes. I just feel breathlessness for a while, then it releases me. Then it comes again, especially when I'm coughing. Has this worsened progressively? Yes, yes. It's gotten very bad, doctor, that's why I came to the hospital. Does it affect your daily activities? Yes, it does doctor. I have not been able to walk for the past two days because of the cough and the fact that I have not been feeling well generally in my body. Now, this fever that you were having, did it start suddenly or gradually? It started gradually then I became very hot and it has been like that. So the fever is high grade, you're very hot? Yes, yes it's high. Did you at attend the question time check by yourself at your temporary job? Yes, I did. I did. I was about 38.9. It's about 37.9. 37.9. OK. And what do you do that released the fever? I took some Prost more. It relieved a bit then, but it didn't last long. It just became hot again and it has been like that ever since. So I just want to ask you some questions. Has this thing happened before in the past? Okay. Has it happened in the past? No, no, no, no. This is the first time I'm expressing this kind of thing. Okay. This is the first time. Do you have any any medical condition like are you asthmatic do you need a blood group on genotype oh no i'm not a doctor i'm fine no i have not seen no i am are you a potential user i can't hear you properly are you hypertensive or diabetic none none no no no i have none of them i have none of them so what have you what have you done to care for yourself so far um i just i just tried to try to get some cough syrup but they didn't probably didn't seem to work properly. They didn't seem to work and since the difficulty in breathing started, I knew I needed to speak to someone, to a doctor, so that's why I came today. For you to know what's wrong with me and treat myself basically. Have you been admitted before? No, not that I can remember. Have you done any surgical procedure before? No. Okay, so I'm just going to ask you some other questions just to know what exactly could be related to the symptoms you're having. So, do you have a headache? Headache? It just comes once in a while. Maybe because the cough, I've not been able to sleep. So, kind of, yeah, kind of, yes. Okay. So, any loss of consciousness? No, no, no. No. Okay. Do you have kata? No, at all. Okay. Do you have any abdominal pain? No, no. Do you have any abdominal pain? No, I have no abdominal pain at all. No. Do you have any bone pain? Yes. Hmm? Thank you. No, I've not vomited at all. No. Do you have any bone pain? Yes. Hmm? No. It's just the shoulders of breath that have been having. The difficulty in breathing that have been having. So, in summary, you're telling me you've had cough, fever, and difficulty in breathing. Yes. Right. And your cough is productive. Yes. All right. So I'm going to have to examine you. Right. I'm going to have to examine you. And I'm going to have to listen to your chest to know whatever is going on in your chest, whether it's a chest infection that is causing you to have a fever and a cough. Do you understand? And then we are going to have you do some investigations like a chest x-ray, a complete blood count, a full blood count, which will tell us whether there's an infection going on depending on the parameters that are elevated or reduced. Do you understand? We are going to do um, ifide segmentation rates to know whether there's an inflammatory process going on. Do you understand? And then we're also going to take your sputum, your deflame, and we're going to send it for culture sensitivity to know what bacteria is being cultured. Please, I just want to ask you, do you smoke? No, no, I don't. I'm a good Christian. I don't smoke, I don't drink. You don't drink alcohol either? I don't drink any of those. I don't do drugs. I don't drink any of that. I'm going to ask you some other questions do you have they are kind of personal questions can I go ahead yeah I just want to know I just want to be fine I just want to know how soon you can start treating me I just want to ask if I just want to ask if you have multiple sexual partners and then your sexual practice no no you have oral sex i'm married no not at all not at all i'm already i'm free so we are going to start you from the history and the examination you have done and then i'm going to ask you to do some investigations however we have some um different house like diagnosis because what the cost of what is causing the cough and the fever we have some um just in the back of our mind which could be the cause you understand you think you have a pneumonia pneumonia chest infection so we're going to start you on the blood spectrum antibiotics right and then we're going to start your cough serum right to treat the cough while we wait for the results of our investigations do you understand okay and then since there's no history of asthma by the time you start start treatment with the antibiotics and the cough syrup, the breathlessness is going to reduce. But we would have checked your oxygen saturation, and we see that it is fine. So there will be no need to place you on oxygen. So we are going to have you do a full blood count, a sputum, and microscop contrast sensitivity. You are going to have you do an ultrasound segmentation rate, and you are going to do a chest x-ray. So let's see if it is a structural problem or a functional problem. Do you understand? Okay, doctor. Okay. You want to ask me a question? Do you have any question? question yes i was going to ask that i'm able to keep me in your speech or do i can i can i be treated from home because i don't know we we are going to um admit you uh for some time to evaluate you because because of the breathlessness you're having, right? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

Cultural sensitivity could take about 72 hours to find this for you to be ready. Do you understand? No problem, doctor. Thank you. No problem, doctor. Thank you very much. I think that's fine. I will just do the labs and wait for you to start the treatment. Thank you very much. I think that's fine. I will just, yeah, I'll just do the labs and wait for, just for you to start the treatment. Thank you. No, I don't promise."

14_TB,data/final_audio/14_TB.wav,"Alright, good afternoon sir. Good afternoon doctor, good afternoon. How may I help you today? What brought you to the hospital today? Doctor, I'm not fine, I'm not fine. I've been coughing for over three months now. I've been coughing for over three months and then I started to lose weight. I noticed that one last month. Oh. So let's take it one after the other. So let's talk about the cough for a second. So you said you started coughing about three months ago, right? Yes, doctor. Okay, so I want to ask, the cough, do you cough like, is it barky first of all? Like when I say barky, I mean like the sound of a dog. Is it barky? No, doctor. I just cough, normal cough. Normal kind of cough. Okay. When you cough, do you cough like in multiple bouts? I mean, are you cough like cough, cough, cough and stop? Yeah, cough, cough, cough and stop. Or is it just like you cough once and you stop? I want to differentiate both of them. It just comes occasionally. It comes a lot, but it's not in bouts. It just comes and I cough when it comes. Okay. Alright then. So when you cough, do you produce anything in your throat? Yes. Do you produce anything in your throat? Yes. Initially, it was yellowish. It was thick. Thick mucus was coming out. It was yellowish. Then later I started noticing some reddish things inside. I don't know whether it is blood. Okay, you noticed some reddish things. First of all, you noticed it was yellowish. Then you noticed some reddish things inside the cough, inside the sputum, the phlegm you produce, right? Yes, it was yellowish at first. It was very thick, yellowish. And then later I started seeing reddish streaks amidst the yellow thickness, thickish sputum. And then I'm not sure. I think it is blood, but I'm not sure. Do you think it is blood, doctor? We'll find out. We'll find out. At the end of the question, we'll properly tie up. At the end of asking you the questions I'm asking you, I’ll be able to tie up what I think is wrong with you. So I'm still going to ask you some other further questions. So about the cough now, do you notice that you sweat a lot in the night? In this past three months, have you been sweating every day in the night? I've been sweating a lot. At first I thought it was the weather, but even when rain started falling, I sweat a lot, heavily sweating. Okay, okay. Then about the cough, since you said it's for three months, what have you done about it? What did you do about it? Did it stop at a point or you have been coughing back and forth for about three months? It has become very embarrassing that I've been coughing for so long. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. I said I've been coughing for quite a while, and it has become embarrassing. So I spoke with a couple of friends. I went to a pharmacy. I got some antibiotics. I got cough syrup. Nothing is working. Nothing is working. I'm even beginning to start losing appetite. I'm very weak. Doctor, I am sick. I am very sick. Okay, okay. No problem. Do you have any chest pain? When you cough, do you feel anything in your chest? Come again, doctor. I can't hear you. Do you feel any pain in your chest? Any chest pain when you cough? Yes, yes. Since this cough started? Yes, when I'm coughing, I feel pain in my chest. And even when I breathe in, when I'm trying to take a deep breath, I feel pain in my chest. Okay. Just to rule that out. No, no, I have not. No pain? No itching? Okay, no itching? You have not had any recent history of itching? No. Not like that, right? No, doctor. Okay, okay Fever? No, not really, not really. Not really. So, you said, back to what you said about the, that you have been sweating every night, so I'd like to probe down that area and ask you other questions. Have I noticed what? That you've lost weight, that you've lost weight in recent times Yes, I told you about, about a month ago, I started noticing, people started telling me that I've been losing weight and then I noticed that my clothes are becoming bigger. Okay, I was about to ask that, how do you, you notice that your clothes, your clothes that were bigger, that were like fitted on you before, they are now more loose, right? Yeah, they are now more loose. Okay, okay, cool. I just, I just feel tired and weak. Just feel tired and weak. Okay. Doctor yeah, what did you say? Doctor, I think I've been running temperature a bit though, although it's not, I can't, it's not really much, but for the past one month I think I've been, I've been some, some high temperature a bit, just very small. But, but any catarrh before that? Any, any catarrh before that? Any catarrh? difficulty in swallowing? No. None of that, right? No, no, none of that. Okay. Any, any back pain? Any back pain at all? No back pain. No back pain. No back pain. Okay. What kind of work do you do? And where do you work? What kind of work do you do? I'm a carpenter and I recently travelled, travelled for a job. I actually stay with a couple of people that I worked with on the job. Where, where, where, where did you travel to? Hmm? Where did you travel to? Did you travel out of your area, out of your country? Yes. What area? Where did you go to? I travelled, I travelled to India. India. All right. All right, cool. Yes. So, when you say.. where you travelled, you were in the midst of a lot of people. So, when, when, when that happened, was there anybody around you then that was coughing, that you noticed that was coughing? Yeah, yeah, I shared… some, some, some, about two people were coughing. I'm just trying to.. yes, there's a possibility. At the end of our conversation, when we are properly tied out what exactly is wrong with you then, we will know if it's from them. Because..but there's a possibility that you got it from people because of, because you were at close proximity to people that have been coughing for a long time. So, there's a chance that you got a cough right from them. So, if you don't mind, I would like to ask some other follow up questions. Yes, I've lost, I've lost appetite. Okay. And I want to ask about your.. back from...from earlier history. My immunization? I don't know. I don't know. I think I did all that when I was younger. Right, cool. No, none of that. I've been very fine until this cough. Okay. Come again? Are you married? Are you married? No, I live alone. I live alone. I'm not. Okay. While I'm asking, I want to ask if there's any recent, any history of like multiple sexual partners too, or sharing of sharps, something like that. Something that..in that regard. No, I don't. No, I don't. Have you been, have you been sharing sharps with anybody, like your clipper and stuff? I live alone and I have my clipper and everything to myself. Is there anybody in your family that has the same complaint, that has been coughing for..that you know, that has the same complaint of coughing for, for about this long? There is nobody. There is nobody. Anybody in your family? Anybody in your family? There is nobody. I'm even surprised myself, why I'm beginning to develop this cough. Now to ask you about some, some social questions. Doctor, I smoke. I smoke. So, you smoke, how many..? I only take alcohol occasionally. Okay. So, about this, about the smoking, how, how much of smoking, first of all, what do you smoke? Then what, what…how much of it do you smoke per day? I smoke cigarettes. I smoke cigarettes and I, I smoke about, about ten, ten sticks per day. Okay. All right. No, I don't. I don't know of any, any drug allergies. Okay. So, I would like to ask you some general questions about…just some general questions. Any headache, any neck pain, any neck stiffness, anything like that? None, none, none of that. Yes, that, that has been happening. Okay, noted. Then any abdominal pain, anything like that? No, no, no abdominal pain. Any constipation, no diarrhea, nothing like that? Nothing, nothing doctor. Okay. So, right now, so, at the end of our conversation, I've been able to have a list of what can be likely wrong with you right? But to properly diagnose, to like confirm, right? We need to do some investigations, right? The first thing we need to do is to do a..okay, before I, before I discuss that, I just want to just quickly examine you, right? So, examine your chest basically and listen to your, your lung fields, your right and left lung fields, right? Then, after we’re done with that, we’ll discuss about it like I’m discussing with you now. That, we’ll need to do some investigations. We will need to do.. first of all, we’ll need to do a fasting… a full blood count rather, full blood count, we’ll need to do an ESR. Alright? We’ll need to do… Okay? ESR is Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate. It’s usually a marker for acute inflammation in the body. Okay. So we’ll also need to do…and a most important thing, a chest x-ray. Because you said you have been having this cough for three months that has not… that has not stopped, even though you have taken… you have taken drugs, you have taken cough syrup and stuff and you’re still.. it’s still there, so we want to know what’s in your chest that is causing you to have this cough right? Okay, doctor. And based on what we are, what, based on what we think it is, there are also some other investigations. The cough that is productive, we need to do like a sputum…so that thing that you’re bringing out in your mouth, we want to.. like.. culture it, and since it's productive, right? So, we need to know, we want to know if there's, we want to know the bacterial cause of, of the cough, the underlying bacterial cause of the cough. I also want to do, what they call an AFB; acid-fast bacilli. It’s the test that we need to use to query what we feel is wrong with you, alongside the chest x-ray. Right? So when we put all this together and we come to the conclusion about what is wrong with you, that’s when we’ll now start you on medications. Right? So what it’s looking like is wrong with you is, we’re trying to query what we call tuberculosis right? Doctor, you think I have tuberculosis? Based on the history, based on the… we are trying to rule it out. My work as a doctor is to tie up your complaints, right? With my experience and my knowledge to be able to know which of them..which…what can be likely wrong with you. Then the investigations will now help us to point out definitive diagnosis, right? So the definitive diagnosis will be after we have done these labs that I've listed. So what's..what comes out of it is what's going to like determine our plan, right? Do you understand? Okay doctor. Do you have any, do you have anything you want to, any concern, anything? I just, I just want to be fine. No problem. At the end of..at the end of the investigations and when the result comes out, we'll, we'll, we'll know. Thank you doctor. Thank you very much. One other thing I'd like to add is the fact that we, we also want to do a gene xpert. Okay. I'm ready to do any of those. Thank you very much doctor. Yeah, no problem.

At the end of our conversation, when we have properly tied out what exactly is wrong with you then, we will know if it's from them. But there's a possibility that you got it from people because you were at close proximity to people that have been coughing for a long time. So there's a chance that you got a cough right from them.

Nothing, nothing at all. So, right now, at the end of our conversation, I've been able to have a list of what I'm like during the year, right? but to properly diagnose to like confirm right we need to do some investigations right the first thing we need to do is to do a okay before i before i discuss that i just want to just quickly examine you right examine your chest basically and listen to your um your lung fields your right and left lung fields right then after we're done with that thing we'll discuss about this like i'm discussing with you now that um we need to do some investigations we need to do first of all we need to be fasting a full block counter other block account we need to do an ESR right we need to do most ESR. Right? We need to do, most importantly, ESR is erythrocyte, as I mentioned, usually a marker for acute inflammation in the body. Okay. So we also need to do and most importantly, we need to do a check session. Because you said you have been having this cough for three months that has not resolved. Remember, you have taken drugs, you have taken cough syrup and stuff, and you have cystitis. We want to know exactly what's in the HXF that's causing you to have this cough, right? Okay, doctor. And based on what we think it is there are also some other um investigations the cough that is productive we need to do like this put some so that's you bring that to your mouth you want to like culture it and since it's productive right so we need to know we want to know if there's we want to know the bacteria cause of of the cough bacteria underlined bacteria cause of the cough. I also want to do what they call an AAFB. I see them as a test that we need to use to query what we feel is wrong with you, alongside check-states. So when we put all this together, we come to a conclusion about what is wrong with you. That's when we start to use medications. So what is looking like is wrong with you is we are trying to query tuberculosis, what we call tuberculosis, right? Based on the issue of... So you think I have tuberculosis? Based on the issue... We are trying to rule it out. I'm not saying you have it, right? But the investigations we are going to do is going to make us confirm that diagnosis right my work as a doctor is to tie up your your complaints right with my experience and my knowledge to know which of them which what can be like wrong with you then the investigations will not help us to point out definitive diagnosis right so the definite diagnosis diagnosis will be after we have done these labs that I have listed so what comes out of it is what is going to like determine our plan do you understand? Thank you doctor Thank you doctor Thank you very much Do you have anything you want Do you have any concern? I just want to be fine. I have no... I just want you to make me fine. No problem. At the end of the investigations and when the result comes out, we will know. Thank you, doctor. Thank you very much. All right. One other thing I'd like to add is the fact that we also want to do the HNX part. Also, I said the first one I said the assistive-vascular specialization, we also want to do HNX part.

7_PUD,data/final_audio/7_PUD.wav,"Hello Good evening. Hello Good evening. Yeah welcome to clinic. I am Tola, 35 years old female. Sorry, how old? I didn’t get that. 35…35 35. OK, you're welcome Tola. Yes, Doctor. OK, so what brings you to the clinic today? Doctor I've been having this abdominal pain for the last two weeks. Sorry to hear that. No It’s that upper part of the…it’s central The middle part that is closer to your chest or your breast? Yes, that is closer to…yes it’s that place. Ok Sorry to hear that. For the last two weeks, Doctor. That would have been so, so discomforting. Yes, doctor. So what is this pain like? Can you describe it? Ah, doctor, this pain, it’s like it’s burning me. It’s like it’s burning. Oh, sorry. Does it come and go or it’s always there? Yes, it comes and goes. It will come, it will go. OK. Ah, doctor, once I refuse to eat like this, the pain will be so much. Ok when you eat, does it feel better? Yes, once I eat food like this, everything just stops and will reduce it by itself. OK Are there things that you eat that make this pain also bad even though you’ve just eaten? I can't…I can't seem to…I can't seem…There is nothing. OK Sorry to hear that. Are you vomiting? No, I'm not vomiting, doctor. OK. Are you purging, like going to toilet frequently? No, doctor. I'm not going to toilet frequently. Any temperature? Doctor, my body is not hot. OK this pain, do you feel it any other place apart from that middle of your chest, like maybe your back, your shoulder? Yes, that pain usually goes to my back when it starts. OK, if I could run this pain on a scale zero to 10, where zero is like where you don't have any pain, and 10 the worst pain of your life, what would this pain be? Doctor, the pain is usually between three and six, sometimes three, sometimes six. That's much. Sorry to hear that. I've not taken anything, Doctor. OK. No, I did not do...I did not do any fasting recently. OK. May I know your last menstrual period, please? That was one month ago. OK, Like exactly one month. No, no, no. Exactly one month. I should be expecting it soon. Alright, no problem. Yes Doctor. Oh, I see. Sorry about that. Apart from…apart from this pain, have you had any surgeries in the past? No, doctor, I've not had any surgeries. OK. Do you drink or smoke? I don't drink alcohol. I don't smoke cigarettes. OK, That's good to know. So from everything you've told me for your age and your presenting symptoms, since I can't see you, there are a few things that I think might be causing your pain. OK, that's actually what it looks like because of your habits-not eating regularly, the use of this pain relief, there are some of these pain relief that can predispose you to having intense pain. So before I get to the management, lest I forget, so next time you're having body pains or anything, please stick to paracetamol. Okay doctor. So the second thing that might be wrong could be a gallbladder stone First, you're going to do what is called H pylori test. It will give us an idea if this is ulcer or something else. Okay? Okay doctor Yeah, I would have loved you to also do an abdominal scan to make sure even if it's ulcer, it's not complicated or there are no other things causing the ulcer. OK, there are a few drugs I will want you to buy. You're going to take these drugs for about two weeks and you should be fine. OK. Please, when you get the result, I would like to see it okay? Okay Doctor. I would also love to give you an antacid like Gestid, something that will give you a fast relief okay? Yes doctor. For now, the advice I have for you is try and eat regularly. Be also mindful because you might gain weight so you don't eat indiscriminately. OK I’ll make sure to do that. And just like I said, yeah, the pain reliefs you've been taking, also try to stay off them and you can stick to paracetamol. That’s just all. Is there anything, I missed…anything you want to say? No, nothing at the moment, Doctor. Alright. So I'll wait for the results of the test then. Okay Thank you very much, I appreciate. Thank you so much. Alright. Yes. Bye Bye.

I don't. And since you've been feeling these symptoms that you're having, has it progressively worsened? Yeah, I feel so. So that's why I actually came to the hospital yesterday to see the doctor and Probably know what's wrong with me and take care of it, basically. Have you been feeling very thirsty? Have you been feeling like your body is dry? Has your urine reduced? No, not at all. No, no. Do you feel weak? Yeah, I feel kind of weak, yeah.

And I would like to examine you, check your level of hydration, check your general physical appearance, see whether you can access your general health. We also like to do an abdominal examination, right? To also give us more information on the abdominal pain you're having, if it could lead us to what is causing the symptoms you're having, the abdominal pain and the stooling. Do you understand? Yes. Although it seems like what you ate, the restaurants you got food from, they must have been where you got some infection. It could have caused the diarrhea. You want to say something? So what exactly is drunk? What exactly is drunk? It's just the food I ate, right? Yeah, it looks like you've had a food poisoning. However, we are going to have to evaluate you and find out what exactly is the cause. So we are going to do some very serious tests. I'm going to check your blood count to make sure there's some infection I don't know. to evaluate you and find out what exactly is the cause so we are going to do some very series of tests i'm going to check your blood count to make this there's some infection which could be gastroenteritis you want to do your um erythrocyte segmentation rate to know if there's any any type of kind of inflammatory disorder that could cause diarrhea like inflammatory disease right And they would also want to do a stool culture microscopy and sensitivity to look out for parasites and some bacteria that could cause you to be having diarrhea. We also check your retroviral status to know if you have a retroviral disease, which could also be a cause of diarrhea. Although that comes in a chronic setting, however, we would also need to just rule that out. Do you understand? Okay, doctor, okay. However, we are going to start you on some fluids to give you some strength and restore your hydration level because you've been using some fluid from this tooling and the vomiting. We also check your electrolytes, electrolytes to know what your electrolyte picture looks like and the ones that will be needed to be, that will need to be corrected. Do you understand? And also lastly, we also want to do an abdominal scan to rule out any structural or functional problems that could be in the abdomen, which could be causing the diarrhea and the abdominal pain. Do you understand? Yes, thank you, doctor. Thank you very much. Do you have any more questions for me? No, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm good. Let's just get out of here. So I can be fine. Thank you.

OK, initially the size was like, it looked…it was…it was small, like an almond. But over time it started becoming bigger, almost every time I checked it, it was increasing in size. Oh, so it's big. What size is it now? What will you compare it with? It's quite big now. Like, at least not as big as my fist. But as maybe the fist of a small…smaller child. It’s bigger than when I first noticed it. OK, I'll take a look at it later. OK, but is it painful? No, there's no pain. There's no pain. Does the swelling ever go away at any time? Yes. It disappears when I lie down in bed, and sometimes I'm able to…when I…I can push it back in. There are times I use my hand and it goes back in. Oh that’s interesting. Okay, alright, any change in the color of the skin over the swelling? No, no pain, Most times when I just train or lift any heavy load, it pops out, it comes out again, but no pain, no, no red…no change in colour around there. Alright do you have any similar swelling in any other part of your body? No, no, no, no, I don't. OK, so you said with every lifting, have you had like constipation before it started or recently? No, no, no Constipation. Thank you. So what have you done about it so far? No, nothing. Since there's no pain. OK, alright, so, so have you noticed any abdominal pain at any time? OK, no, no, no, no. Any vomiting or nausea? No, no, no vomiting. Alright. Thank you, Sir. Alright so I would like to ask you some other questions. Yes, I think when I was about 18 years, they…I…they, I had a problem with my appendix, and they removed my appendix. Oh, OK so you’ve had your appendix removed. That was about when I was at about 18 years of age. Oh, yeah you said 18 years. Sorry I missed that Yes, yes Okay Thank you. So, Sir, have you had any, any, any cough for a long duration? No, no, I have not. So you don't have cough, you don't have chest pain? Nothing, yes Alright, so do you have any other complaints apart from that? No, none Okay, Alright. No, I have not had any blood transfusion. OK. So Sir, are you being managed for any medical condition like hypertension? Yes, I…I…I have hypertension. Okay, no diabetes, asthma or ulcer. Peptic ulcer? No, no, no, I don't have any. Alright So how are you treating your hypertension, Sir? I was placed on amlodipine. I take 10 milligram every day. Alright, So that's good, Sir. Yes, I check in a nearby pharmacy every once in a while and it has…it’s always okay. Oh, that's very good to hear Alright, Sir, so apart from the amlodipine, are you on any other routine medications? No, I am not. OK Are you aware of any drug allergy or any allergy at all? No…No, I am not. OK. Alright sir, I would  like to ask you some questions about your social life. Yes. So do you take, do you take alcohol? Yes,  occasionally, after work, I can take one or two bottles of beer. That’s just all. every day? is it every day, Every day. Until…I stopped when about 15 years ago, when I was first diagnosed with hypertension. But before then, I used to take every day. Do you take, do you smoke tobacco in any form or cigarettes? Yes, I used to smoke too before. Alright. Sir, Is there any other thing you would like to tell me? Oh, I forgot, doctor.  Another medication was added for me.-Lisinopril. I was trying to remember the name. So I'm on amlodipine and lisinopril. Oh, OK. Thank you so much for that So do you have an idea of what you think might be going on, Sir? To be honest, I…I don't know. I actually do not know. Alright, Sir. It's good that you have come to the hospital. Alright, Sir, so I’ll like to examine, you now, if that's fine. Yes, that's OK. OK, alright. So…so I would like you to lie on the bed. OK. Alright sir, so it will involve me opening up to your abdomen and lower down your…your thigh. So I'll just examine this way. OK. (coughs) Alright. Thank you very much. Alright, Sir, thank you very much for speaking to me and allowing me to examine you. Yes, please go ahead. Alright, Sir. So based on what you have told me and my examination, I think you might be having a hernia. Yes, I think I've heard of it. OK, yes. so it basically just means…like…there's like a defect around your groin and some parts of your intestine pops in through there and sometimes when you lie down, it pops back in. Yes, yes. I think that makes sense. Yeah, so it's quite common. And then…and then I would most likely be referring you to the general surgeon so that you're being evaluated. Yes, yes, I'm with you. Yes, so…yeah so…so far it seems like an uncomplicated hernia because sometimes we could have complications like strangulation of the intestine that pops out through that defect. But you don't have abdominal pain or anything like that. So basically, I would just like to do some basic investigation like some blood work, like a full blood count, just to check your blood level and all. Yes, that's OK, yes, yes. But if you have any complaints like abdominal pain, vomiting before the review, please do come back to the hospital. Alright Alright, do you have any questions? No, I…I don't. As long as I'll get better when I see the surgeon. Alright. Thank you very much. Thank you, Doctor. Alright. Have a nice day.",607.886125,med-convo-nig,"Hello sir. Hello doctor. Good good morning.

More of…okay like a software…okay. Do you drink or smoke alcohol? Do you drink or you smoke, rather. Do you drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes? No OK, OK. So I would…before…before I tell you, before we discuss further on what…what...what I think, I would love to just examine you. Okay? OK. I would want to…I would call in my nurse who will serve as a chaperone. A chaperone is someone, yeah…so I'll call in the nurse, she’ll serve as a chaperone. We'll just…I'll just examine you, examine your abdomen and…and so that I can come to a better conclusion of what's happening. I hope…I hope you're OK with that. I hope you're comfortable with that. Okay doctor. Alright, so now let me share what I think. so from…from all indications you are…you… although you…you…there's a…there's an active pregnancy which…did…did you tell me if you confirmed the pregnancy by yourself? did you say…did you tell me that? did you confirm it? I'm not sure if you asked but yeah I took the urine test and then I went to the hospital for a blood test. OK OK, So one of the things we would also do here is just to confirm it with a blood test again, do you understand? I've done a blood test Before, OK good. So if you are…the symptoms you're having, the symptoms of the lower abdominal pain are symptoms that can be seen in early pregnancy but when you now look at the pain you have, the peppery feeling when you're urinating, you might also be having a urinary tract infection, which is…which is…which is most also likely, do you understand? Okay Then some of the other things that can cause lower abdominal pain is maybe having fibroid coexisting with pregnancy, but that might not cause you to have a fever but this line of thought would…would influence the test I would run. I want to do a full blood count, then we'll take your sample for urinalysis and urine culture. Okay Yes, so that the abdominopelvic scan will confirm the pregnancy and it will also help us to see if there's any infection or anything, maybe fibroid or anything that might…might support what we are thinking. Do you understand? Then from there we'll treat. So the urine culture might take a few days, so the results that can be reviewed today, such as the full blood count, urinalysis and abdominal pelvic scan, we’d review, then you might have to come back in a few days for the culture, the result of the culture and sensitivity. Alright. And do you have any questions? OK, Yeah. Yes, Doctor. So I think I've gone to one hospital and they said that my blood group is B-negative. Can I check to, to be sure? Will it affect my baby? OK, no. Some of…some of the…at 14 weeks now, we would also register you for antenatal care, you understand. So ideally, because of the…my thoughts of the urinary tract infection, I wanted to resolve that first but now you're here, and there's an active pregnancy, Once we have…we are done with the abdomen pelvic scan, all of it is confirmed, we'll register you for antenatal care, and some of the other tests we’ll want to include will be your blood group, your genotype, then we’ll do some viral screening. These are tests to just be sure that the pregnancy can proceed properly, well and there's nothing to worry about. Do you understand? So we’ll do your blood group, your genotype, the viral screening, then they'll check your…they'll just do your random blood sugar, just some baseline tests so that we'll have some baseline, you understand. Okay Then we'll also commence you on some medications to support the pregnancy like vitamins, iron, calcium, and then we'll give you appointments for your antenatal visits. So I'll discuss more about this when we are reviewing the results, OK? OK. Yes, so do you have any other questions, Ma? No, doctor. Alright, so thank you. I will send you to the lab now, Okay?

So if you're the symptoms you're having, the symptoms of the lower abdominal pain are symptoms that can be seen in early pregnancy, but when you now look at the pain you have, the peppery feeling when you're urinating, you might also be having a urinary tract infection, which is most also likely, do you understand? Then some of the other things that can cause low abdominal pain is maybe having fibroid coexisting pregnancy, but that might not cause you to have a fever. But this line of thoughts would influence the test that I would run. I want to do a full blood count, then we take your sample for urinalysis and urine culture, then we would also do you an abdominal pelvic scan, do you understand? Yes, so that the ultrasound scan will confirm the pregnancy and it will also help us to see if there's any infection or anything, maybe fibroid or anything that might support what we are thinking. Do you understand? Then from there we'll treat. So the urine culture might take a few days, so the results that can be reviewed today such as the full blood count, urinalysis and abdominal pelvic scan would review, then you might have to come back in a few days for the culture.

Once we have we are done with the abdominal and pelvic scan, all of it is confirmed. We'll register you for antenatal care. And some of the other tests you will want to include will be your blood group, your genotype, that will do some viral screening. These are tests to to to just be sure. that the pregnancy can proceed properly well and there's nothing to worry about, you understand.

Then we'll also commence you on some medications to support the pregnancy like vitamins, iron, calcium, and then we'll give you appointments for your antenatal visits.

A chaperone is someone that, yeah, so. i would want to i would i'm calling my nurse who will serve as a chapter on each other yeah so i'll call in the nurse service champion we'll just i'll just examine you examine your abdomen and um and so that i can come to a better conclusion of what's happening i hope i hope you're okay with that so we'll just expose you to just above your um above just a little above your um above the abdomen that's we're not going as far as you choose just the abdomen i want to examine you i hope you're comfortable with that okay all right so um so now let me share what i think so um from from all indications you're um you although you you um there's a there's an active pregnancy which did you tell me if you confirm the pregnancy by yourself did you say did you tell me that did you confirm it i'm not sure if you asked but um yeah i took um the urine test and then i went to the hospital for a blood test okay okay so um one of the things we'd also do here is just to confirm it with a blood test again you understand but would also i've done a blood test before okay good so if you are the symptoms you're having the symptoms of the lower abdominal pain are symptoms that can be seen in early pregnancy but when you now look at the um pain you have the peppery feeling when you're urinating you might also be having a urinary tract infection which is which is which is most also likely do you understand then some of the other things that can cause lower abdominal pain is maybe having fibroid coexisting in pregnancy but that might not cause you to have a fever but the this did this line of thoughts would would influence the test i would run what i want to do a full blood count then you take some your sample for urinalysis and urine culture then i would also do you an abdominal pelvic scan do you understand okay yes so that's the abdomen scan will confirm the pregnancy and it also help us to see if there's any infection like anything maybe fibroid or anything that might might support what we are thinking do you understand then from there we'll treat so the urine culture might take a few days so the results that can be reviewed today such as the full blood count urinalysis and abdominal pelvic scan would review then you might have to come back in a few days for the culture the result of the culture and sensitivity all right do you have any questions okay yeah yes so i think i've gone to one hospital and they said that my blood group is b negative can i check so to be sure will it affect my baby okay no um some of some of the um At 14 weeks now would also register you for natal care you understand so ideally i because of the um my thoughts of the urinary tract infection i wanted to resolve that first but now you're here and you're there's an active pregnancy once we have we are done with the abdomen pelvic scan all of it is confirmed we'll register you for antenatal care and some of the other tests you will want to include will be um your blood group your genotype that will do some viral screening these are tests to to to just be sure that the pregnancy can proceed properly well and there's nothing to worry about you understand so do your blood group your genotype the viral screening then um they'll check you they'll just do a random blood sugar just some baseline tests so that we'll have some baseline you understand then um we'll also comment you on some medications to support the pregnancy like vitamins iron, and then we'll give you appointments for your antenatal visits. So I'll discuss more about this when we are reviewing the results. Okay. Yes. So do you have any other questions, Ma? No, doctor. Alright, so thank you. I'll send you to the lab now, okay?

I’m…I'm not feeling too great. That's why I'm here. But I'm OK. Yes, I've been listening in on the conversation and I have just a few more questions to ask you and I'm sorry about your health. Erm, am I permitted to go on? Yes you are, you are. Thank you.   Alright, thank you. No, no, no, I don't feel that way. Do you feel some electric shock in your hands or legs at any point? No, no, no, no, I don't. Alright, thank you for that. Has there been any reduction in your urine output recently? Umm, no, no, it has just been the same. I can’t…I didn't notice any change. Oh Okay thank you. And have you ever felt like you were going to lose consciousness like you're going to faint or fall at any point? No, no, no, not that I can remember, can’t remember anything like that. Thank you very much No, I…I just want to get better. I don't have any questions. OK, before I go, what was the reading at the outreach when they told you your blood pressure was elevated? Uh, they told me 162 / 100. Alright, thank you. Measuring that at least twice in the space of 4 to 6 hours is when we make a diagnosis of hypertension and with your family history that's in your dad and with some of your history of…what's it called? Headache, palpitation, we uh…tend to think that you have a high blood pressure which is also called hypertension in this case, and really it's manageable. We’ll prescribe some drugs for you. But before we do most of those things, we would also want you to do some investigations. Yes, I understand. I'm following. Yes, so we would like you to do a chest x-ray, we would like you to do an ECG. We would like to also take your blood pressure again to confirm what the reading says today and then we would like to also book you for a regular appointment for the next few months, just to make sure that we are able to monitor you. We are going to place you on some drugs. We are going to start with a calcium channel blocker. This is one of the drugs used to treat hypertension. And we would also like to advise you on some lifestyle modification, um I don't know how much of alcohol you’ve had in the past or you do, but you will have to either reduce that or quit if you are…if you take alcohol. Yeah also, you have to stay away from smoking, use of tobacco. You'd also have to reduce your salt intake as much as possible. So in hypertension, what happens is that the body has a lot of salt and then it retains water and because it retains water, the heart has so much to do to pump that fluid round the body. And that is why it needs…it has to do more work, and it is the work that it has to do that increases the blood pressure. So that is why…that is why you have to reduce your salt intake as much as possible. We also have to check your lipid profile. By checking your lipid profile, we're trying to make sure that you do not have any dyslipidemia, which usually also contributes to hypertension. And with all of these tests done, as soon as you get the result back, we’ll know the next steps to take. Do you understand everything I’ve said? Hmm yes, I think I understand. I do. Thank you so much. Do you have any anything that we have not addressed today? Maybe, I was thinking I’ll also get something to help me sleep better. Or is it after I treat, I’ll begin to sleep better? Definitely we’ll help you…we would give you something to help you sleep better. Um, yes sorry I didn’t mention that. That is also common with elevated blood pressure, and it is something that we can manage. So would also give you something to help you sleep better, and we’ll see you in the clinic after your result, your test results are out. Alright, thank you.

They told me 162 over 100. All right. Thank you. So I would like to say that, first, I'm sorry about this. Hypertension is one of the chronic diseases that it doesn't go away and if your blood pressure is elevated to a certain level for some cases it has to be over 160 110 or in some other cases it could be above 140 90 measuring that at least twice in the space of 46 hours is when we make a diagnosis of hypertension and with your family history that's in your dad and with um some of your history of um what's it called headache, palpitation, where I tend to think that you have a high blood pressure, which is also called hypertension in this case. And really it's manageable, we'll prescribe some drugs for you. But before we do most of those things we also want you to do some investigations first we'd like to know if this hypertension has been there for a while or either it's just started so do you understand what i'm saying yes i understand i'm following yes so we'd like you to do a chest x-ray we'd like like you to do an ECG, we'd like to also take your blood pressure again to confirm what the reading says today and then we'd like to also book you for a regular appointment for the next few months just to make sure that we are able to monitor you we're going to place you on some drugs. We're going to start with a calcium channel blocker. This is one of the drugs used to treat hypertension. I would also like to advise you on some lifestyle modification. I don't know how much of alcohol you've had in the past, so you do, but you would have to either reduce that or quit if you take alcohol. Also, you have to stay away from smoking, use of tobacco. You'd also have to reduce your salt intake as much as possible.

You also have to check your lipid profile. By checking your lipid profile, we are trying to make sure that you do not have any dyslipidemia, which usually also contributes to hypertension. And with all of these tests done, as soon as you get the result back we'll know the next step stick do you understand everything i've said yes i think i understand i do thank you so much um do you have any thing that we have not addressed today um maybe i was thinking i'll also get something to help me sleep better or is it after i treat i'll begin to sleep better definitely we'll help you we'll give you something to help you sleep better um yes sorry i didn't mention that that is um that's also common with elevated blood pressure and it is something that we can manage. So it would also give you something to help you sleep better and see the clinic after your results, your test results are out. All right. Thank you. You're welcome."
9_Asthma,data/final_audio/9_Asthma.wav,"Good evening, Sir Good evening, Doctor. OK. How are you doing today? I'm very fine, thank you. How are you? How are you? I'm fine, thank you. So, my name is Doctor Laja. I'll be asking you some questions to know… you're here today. OK. Please, can I meet you? Yes. I‘m Mr. Akinsanya Akeem Nice to meet you, Mr. Akeem. Is that fine if I call you Mr. Akeem Yes, that's fine. That's fine. How old are you? I'm 27. Oh, great. What do you do? I'm an accountant. All right, Mr. Akeem So, what's your complaints today? Well, I've been having this cough for like 2 days now. OK, so this cough, when did you know… you noticed it Two days ago, Was it a sudden cough? Were you doing… the cough started? Did you inhale, swallow something or it just started on its own? No, no, it's it's started gradually, OK, gradually. you describe this cough, Does it sound barky in nature? No, it doesn't. OK Is it associated with vomiting? No Vomiting. OK. So, this cough, is it a continuous cough that's, you know, it interrupts your breathing when it starts? No, I don't think that has ever happened. OK, noticed. is there any mucus coming out? Is it productive? No. OK, so it's more of a dry cough? Yes, it's dry. OK. So, on an, on an average, since the cough started, how bad is it on a scale of one to 10? I'll give it, I'll give it a 7, it's really painful, yeah. So, I get chest pain when I cough. Whenever the cough comes. Cough. Yes Sorry about that.  Do you notice it If it's worse in the morning or at night or it could be at any time? It's usually worse at night. Usually, it becomes way more frequent than during the day. It happens all the time, but it becomes more frequent at night. OK. So, you said you have some chest pains, too. Yes. Is there any difficulty breathing? Yes. I find it really difficult, very difficult to breathe sometimes. And. OK, do you never notice? Has anyone ever told you maybe you whistle when you're sleeping? Has anyone ever said something like that to you? Yeah. Yes. My wife complained of that. OK, OK. So is there any fever? Do you have any temperature? No. OK, what about Catarrh? Do you have catarrh? No. No Catarrh currently, no Catarrh. Have you been in contact with anyone coughing in recent times? No. Any night sweats? Do you notice that you sweat excessively, especially at night? No… No doctor. Any weight loss? at all? Not at all. OK. So if I may ask, have you noticed maybe you sneeze a lot when perfume is around you or you smell maybe a strong scent, Have you noticed anything like that? Yes, Yes, that's correct. OK, that's OK. So, was there any recent travel? Did you travel far, maybe any dusty environment in recent times? No, no. No, OK, you… are you…Do you have any known allergies. Anything you're allergic to? Well, sometimes I don't really have strong allergies, but I noticed that whenever I inhale fumes or dust or perfumes, if someone uses a strong perfume close to me, I start to sneeze and sometimes it progresses to a cough and I I start finding it difficult to breathe. OK, I see. Is there any food you don't eat that you have allergic response to? No, no, no. Let me ask, do you have any family history of asthma? Or you’re not sure? Sorry Doctor, I, I, I I'm allergic to nuts. Nuts. Yes. okay… eat nuts… What do you notice? When I eat nuts, I notice swelling around my… around my face sometimes and then I… I notice also this rash around my arm, my face, my body generally Oh, I see. OK. So I was asking if you know any, if there's anybody in your family with history of asthma, maybe your cousin, your dad, your uncle, any issue of asthma? Well, I think my aunt does. My aunt does. OK, that is good. Are you currently on any medication? I have been having this leg pain for a while, so currently I'm on ibuprofen. OK, for the leg pain, for how long have you been using it? I've been taking it for like 5 days now. OK, so asides the cough now, has there been any, you know, whenever you're sleeping you wake up because you can't breathe well have you noticed any of that? No. OK, Any leg swelling? Leg swelling, No. Not that I've noticed, No. Are you hypertensive? No, I am not. OK. Any vomiting? Any stooling? Not at all. Great. Are you diabetic? Have I… Have I asked you that? No, you haven't. But I am not. Do you have ulcer? No, I don't. OK. Please sorry to ask, do you smoke cigarettes? No, I don't. How about alcohol, do you drink alcohol? alcohol, I don't take alcohol, doctor. OK, good. So aside ibuprofen you're taking currently for your knee pain, is there any other medication you take routinely? currently, no No. So, I've listened to your complaints and given your history of, you know, the cough which is what's at night and is a non productive cough as well. Yeah, that's correct. Reaction to, you know, strong sense like perfumes and fumes generally. And you also mentioned you have allergies to nuts. Yes. OK. And then the family history. So, your history is pointing in the direction of asthma, bronchial asthma. I don't know if you're aware of it have you heard of asthma before? I'm sure you said your auntie is asthmatic, so I'm sure you'll be familiar with asthma. 18 Yes… Yes. But, I never really thought I have it myself. Yes, it seems like, you know, it's possible to have missed it in childhood and it's a late onset asthma. And we’re starting to see the symptoms now. OK, OK. Although we could also have some other cases, but it's pointing towards, you know, asthma and then you don't smoke, right? No, I do not. And then you're an accountant, you mentioned that earlier. Yes, yes. You don't exactly have exposure to some kind of, you know, chemicals in factories because factory workers too could have such exposure. But it's tilting towards us now, although we would like to do some other tests to rule out possible possibilities to, you know, possible differentials such as, you know, COPD, which is the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, have you heard that before? yes. But what tests exactly are we talking about, Doctor? So, we're going to do a lung function test, which is…peak flowmeter of which we're going to give you something to blow it into, Ok And then we're also going to do a spirometry for you, which we're trying to confirm our diagnosis. So, like I said, you know, it's might… most likely an asthma, but you know we also have to check out the other possibilities. So, in the spirometry tests we're going to, you know, give you a bronchodilator and then we'll measure your… the ratio of the FEV over FVC volume of which if it gets better then it will confirm our diagnosis of asthma and would most likely put you on some bronchodilators and corticosteroids. But asides that, I would also want to advise you on some lifestyle changes, you know, because for someone that's asthmatic, you have to stay away from the triggers. So, I would advise that, you know, stay away from dusty environment. And I'm sorry, I forgot to mention, in the parlor, where in your sitting room do you use towels or rug? No, I do not. I do not. What's the kind of flooring there? Sorry, I didn't get that. You're flooring like the floor. Is it tiles or rug? Oh, tiles, tiles, tiles. OK, That's OK. OK, You understand? And I'm going to also write medications for you. Like, I'm sure you've seen an inhaler before. Yes. OK, good. So, I'm going to advise that wherever you're…sorry I'm going to, I'm going to have to be on an inhaler. Yes. Wow. Wow. To Prevent future attacks. And then in case of an acute attack, you can always have one in case of emergencies like that, in case you're having a poor breathing. So you're just going to pull out the inhaler and you just give about two puffs. You take a deep breath, inhale, take two puffs and then you breathe it in. Yes, I do. OK. Also, you had, like I said, most important thing is lifestyle modifications. You have to stay away from things that can trigger your asthma, extreme positions, extreme stress. Yeah, I'm with you, Doctor. OK, then just your environment generally. OK. So, we'd also want to just do some other investigations, such as the chest X-ray, just to look at the lungs. Generally, That's fine. Yes, that's fine. There's no problem. And I also run a full blood count, so just to look at your lymphocytes and your eosinophils. All right. All right. All right. Check your temperature. Check your SPO 2 levels. The vitals. Yes, I do. Can you run through? All right, so here it says that my temperature is 37°. my respiratory rate is 12 circles per minute, 97%. Spo2 is 97%, OK. Uhm, my pulse rate is 70 beats per minute, 70 beats. OK is 120/80mmHg. Your What? I didn't get that Sorry. My blood pressure. Your blood pressure. OK Is what? Yeah, 120/80 mmHg. OK. Thank you so much. OK. So, what we're going to do is we're going to run the tests like I've mentioned earlier. And pending for that time. I'll put you on some medications, like I mentioned, the Bronchodilators. Whenever the results are out, we'll know what to do from there. Would you like to ask for me anything? Well, I think I so far, I understand basically how that you've you've said. Uhm… So yes, we can just go ahead with the test and then I'll have the that you've prescribed. Thank you Mr Akeem for your time so we...",774.232,med-convo-nig,"Good evening, sir. Good evening, doctor. How are you doing today? I'm very fine, thank you. How are you? How are you?

Did you travel far? Maybe any dusty environment in recent times? No, no. No, okay. Do you have any known allergies? Anything allergic to? Well, sometimes. I don't really have strong allergies, but I noticed that whenever I- I mean, here are films or perfumes. If someone uses a strong perfume close to me, I start to sneeze, and sometimes it progresses to a cough and I start finding it difficult to breathe. Okay, I see. Is there any food you don't eat that you have allergic response to? No, no, not the We are not sure. I am allergic to nuts. Nuts, yes. In case it's nuts, what do you notice? When I eat nuts, I notice swelling on my face sometimes. And then I notice also this rash around my face, my body general. I was asking if you know, honey, if there's anybody in your family with issue of asthma, maybe a cousin, your dad, your uncle. Any issue of asthma? Well, I think my aunt does. My aunt does. Okay, that's great. Well, are you currently on any medication? I have been having this leg pain for a while, so currently I'm on ibuprofen. Okay, for the leg pain, for how long have you been taking it? I've been taking it for like five days now. Okay, so besides the cough, no, has there been any, you know, whenever you're sleepy you wake up because you can't breathe well? Have you noticed any of that? No. Okay, any leg swelling? Leg swelling? No, not that I've noticed, no. Are you a vegetarian? No, I am not. Okay, any vomiting, any stilling? Not at all. You diabetic? About that, I asked you that. No, you haven't, ma'am.

Okay. medication you take currently no no so i've listened to your complaints and given your history of you know the cough which is worse at nights and is a non product of as well and then also you found it's worse during seasons that is during rainy season if you have shown to no strong scents like perfumes and flowers and you also mentioned you have allergies to Now, yes, okay. And then the family history. Do your history is pointing in direction of asthma? Okay, asthma. I don't know if you are aware of it. Have you heard of asthma before? I'm sure you said your aunt is asthmatic. I'm sure you are familiar with asthma. Yes, yes, well, I never really thought I have it myself. Yes, it's possible to have missed it in childhood. Okay. So what are you, um, although we could also have some other cases, but it's pointing towards, you know, asthma. And then you don't smoke, right? No, I don't. And then you're an accountant. Did you mention that earlier? Yes, yes. You don't exactly have, um, exposure to some kind of, you know, hem cows in factories. Because factory workers too could have such exposure. We would like to do some other tests to rule out possible possibilities to, you know, possible differentials such as COPD, which is the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, I think that was before. Yes, but what tests exactly are we talking about, doctor? So I'm going to do a lung function test, which is the peak flow meter of which we're going to give you some things to build a into. which we're trying to plan our diagnosis so like i said you know it's in my most likely an asthma but you know we also have to check out the other possibilities so in the spirometric test we're going to you know give you a bronchodilator and then we'll measure your the ratio of the f e v o v a f f v c volume of which if it gets better then to confirm our diagnosis of asthma and would most likely put you on some Uncle dilators and vertical steers. Well, aside that, I would also want to advise you on some lifestyle changes, you know, because for someone that's asthmatic, you have to stay away from the triggers. So I would add that you know, stay away from dusty environments. And I'm sorry I forgot to mention in the parlor way in your city room, do you use towels? What's the kind of flooring there? Sorry, I didn't get that. Your flooring, like the floor, is it tiles or rug? No, it's tiles, tiles, tiles. Okay, that's okay. So I want you to reduce your exposure to just as much as possible. Stay away from strong scents such as perfume, those things that can trigger your asthma attack. Okay. I understand. I'm going to also write medications for you. Like, I'm sure you've seen that before. Yes. Okay. so i'm going to advise that wherever you are very i'm going to have to be on an inhaler yes well to prevent future attacks and then in case of an attack you can always have one of the emergency things like that in case you're having the problem with it so you're just going to pull out the inhaler and you just give about two puffs you take a deep breath inhale take two puffs and then And that yes, I do. Okay. Also, you are, like I said, most important thing is lifestyle modifications. You have to stay away from things that can figure your asthma. Extreme stress. Yeah, I'm with your doctor. Okay. Then dust and environments generally. Okay, so we would also want to just do some. Lungs generally that's fine. Yes, that's fine. So I also want a full blood count so just to look at your lymphocytes and your eosinophils. Alright, so I'm going to do a quick spell examination on you. Check your temperature, check your SPO2 levels. Do you have the... So, I hear you. I hear you. I hear you. I hear you. I hear you. I hear you. I hear you. I hear you. I hear you. I hear you.

Also, like I said, most important thing is lifestyle modifications. You have to stay away from things that can trigger your asthma. Okay. Extreme conditions, extreme stress. Yeah, I'm with you, doctor. Okay. Then just the environment generally. Okay, so we'd also want to just do some other investigations, such as the chest x-ray, just to look at the lungs generally. If that's fine. Yes, that's fine. There's fine there's no problem i can also run a full blood count so just to look at your lymphocytes and your ischial fields all right so i'm going to do a quick skull examination on you all right all right check your temperature check your or SQL 2 levels.

Any chest pain currently? No, not at all? No. How about palpitations? Do you feel like your heart is beating heavily against your chest? No. How about leg swelling? ehn,..I noticed that actually in this pregnancy too. Yes, my leg has been swollen. OK. So, these symptoms are, is there anything that's making it worse or relieving the symptoms? Is there anything that relieves the headache or makes it worse? I use paracetamol, but the paracetamol is not working at all. Is the headaches there... not working. Have you done any other things so far apart from taking paracetamol? No. No. OK, so let's, let's talk about your previous pregnancies. How was the, how was it delivered your last baby? It was normal delivery. Was it a male or female? A female? Female. What was the birth weight? I gave birth to it myself. Ok it was 2.7 two point seven. Yes. OK. And then this pregnancy, how exactly was it conceived? You conceived it on your own. Was there any assistance? No, it was just me and my husband. You know, and I've done scan. I've done. So, it's actually a twin pregnancy. OK, yes. From the last scan that they did, it's safe to assume that you want to keep this pregnancy. This pregnancy is desired. oh yes, definitely. All right. Do you have any other medical conditions, say diabetes? No. No. OK, how's your menstruation been like? before this pregnancy? Any painful menstruation? Bleeding? No No… Normally at… at 14 years of age and there's not been any problem. I do my period regularly before the pregnancy. All right, so no pain during sex, No vaginal discharge for that? No at all. All right. So, you've not had any surgery in the past? No. No surgery. All right, So, if I heard you correctly… correctly, you're married. Yes? Yes, I am you live with your husband? Yes. OK. Do you drink, do you smoke? And My daughter And your daughter? Do You drink? No, I don't smoke. Erm… in this pregnancy, No. But before I got pregnant, you know once in a while like a smoke, let's say just a glass of wine, you know, red wine maybe, like twice weekly. But that was before the pregnancy. But, since I've confirmed my baby, I don't drink at all. OK Are you on any routine medications? It's just the, you know, the routine drugs you just gave us in the hospital, like pregnan care and all of those, those are the things I'm using. OK, All right. So, from your history it is highly suggestive that you have preeclampsia. I don't know if you… you were told in your previous pregnancy of this condition but it's similar to what happened in the previous pregnancy. Sometimes you're during pregnancy the BP gets high, and it's caused by the pregnancy actually and then after delivery it's resolves. So, at this gestational age, 30 weeks, it's advisable that we start to place you on some medications to control this, the…  the rising BP, because we wouldn't want you to have complications of preeclampsia and complications will definitely involve seizure, yes. And we don't want that to happen. So it's advisable that we place you on blood pressure medications to reduce your blood, blood pressure and then we also want to put you on magnesium sulfates. But before we do any of that, we'd like to send you send you for some tests, send you to the lab to do some tests, and then want to recheck your blood pressure and keep monitoring them. But the test we'd like you to be on, we want you to do a full blood count, electrolytes, urea and creatinine and then uric acid. We'd also want you to do a liver function test, cause your liver may also be affected. That could be a complication of the condition also. So, we want you to do all of that and then we'd like you to have a repeat scan so that we can know how correctly your baby was placed. Then, it's very important that you do a urinalysis. Also want to see how much protein you have in your urine and that would severely influence our management. So, after doing that, I would like to start you on some medications. Magnesium sulphate, I don't know if you are familiar, you must have had that in your previous pregnancy. We want to put you on magnesium sulphate to prevent you from having any feet or seizures, right And then like I said, we'd put you on blood pressure medications also. So we just to we hope that you'll be fine and we'll be able to continue this pregnancy. We'd also want to give you some steroids so that's your baby's lungs, can develop faster should in case we have to deliver your child. However, you should know that this condition puts you at the risk of having a Cesarean section 'cause if, if in any case you are not able to control your blood pressure properly, It is very important that we deliver you of this child. So, we'll put you on the steroids. So that's per adventure we have to deliver your child before term. I'm aware, I'm sure you must be aware that the term is 37 weeks, and you are 37. You are 30 weeks currently. So, in case we can't get you to 37 weeks fully, we want your child's lung to have matured enough and that will be the reason for putting you on steroids.

We'd also want to give you some steroids so that your baby's lungs can develop faster. Should in case we have to deliver a child.

No, not at all no have you been having any difficulties breathing not at all how about vomiting not for me too not vomiting okay no no so your blood pressure before this pregnancy, how has it been like? Has anyone ever told you that you have high blood pressure? No, nothing at all that I have high blood pressure. But in my first pregnancy too, I had something similar. I had high blood pressure in pregnancy. Okay. After pregnancy, it took pressure in pregnancy. Okay. After pregnancy, it's resolved? Yes. Okay. Any chest pain currently? No, not at all. No. How about palpitations? Do you feel like your heart is beating heavily against your chest? No. How about leg swelling? I noticed that actually in this pregnancy too. Yes, my leg has been swollen. Okay. So these symptoms, is there anything that's making it worse? Or relieving the symptoms? Is there anything that relieves the headache or makes it worse? I use Prastamol, but the Prastamol is not working at all. The headache is not working. Yes, I use Prastamol. Have you done any other things so far apart from taking Prastamol? No. No. Okay. Let's talk about your previous pregnancies. How was it delivered, your last baby? It was normal delivery. Was it a male or female? A female. A female. Or was it a birth rate? A birth rate, myself. It was 2.7. 2.7. Yes. Okay. And then this pregnancy, how exactly was it conceived? You conceived it on your own? Okay. It was 2.7. 2.7? Yes. Okay. And then this pregnancy, how exactly was it conceived? You conceived it on your own? Was there any assistance? No. It was just me and my husband. All right. And I've done scan. I've done... It's actually a twin pregnancy. Okay. Yes, from the last scan that they did. It's safe to assume that you want to keep this pregnancy in your pregnancy yes definitely all right do you have any other medical conditions say diabetes no no okay how's your menstruation being like before this pregnancy any painful menstruation bleeding no no i've talked about it normally at 14 years of age and there's not been any problem i do my period regularly before the pregnancy all right so no pain during sex no vaginal discharge for that No No, not at all. Alright, so you've not had any surgery in the past? No, no surgery. Alright, so if I heard you correctly, you are married? Yes, I am. Do you live with your husband? Yes. Okay, do you drink? And my daughter. And your daughter. Do you drink? No, I don't smoke. And in this pregnancy, no. But before I got pregnant, no one's never locationally. I could smoke, let's say, just a glass of wine, you know, red wine. Maybe like twice weekly. So that was before the pregnancy the pregnancy but since i've confirmed my baby i don't drink at all okay are you on any routine medications it's just the you know the routine just give us in the hospital like pregnant care and all of those those are the things i'm using okay all right so from your history it highly suggestive that you have preeclampsia. I don't know if you were told in your previous pregnancy of this condition, but it's similar to what happened in the previous pregnancy. Sometimes during pregnancy, the BP gets high and it's caused by the pregnancy actually. And then after delivery, it resolves. So at I'll be right back. pregnancy the BP gets high and it's caused by the pregnancy actually and then after delivery it resolves. So at this gestational age 30 weeks it's advisable that we start to place on some medications to control this the the rising BP because we don't want you to have complications of pre-eclampsia and complications will definitely involve seizure. Yes, and we don't want that to happen. So, it's advisable that we place you on blood pressure medications to reduce your blood pressure. and then we also want to put you on magnesium sulfate but before we do any of that we'd like to send you for some tests, send you to the lab to do some tests and then once we check your blood pressure and keep monitoring them but the test we'd like you to be on we want you to do a full block count, electrolytes, urea and creatinine, and then uric acid. We'd also want you to do a liver function test because your liver may also be affected. That could be a complication of the condition also. So, we want you to do all of that and then we'd like you to have a repeat scan so that we can know how correctly your baby was placed then it's very important that you do your analysis also want to see how much protein you have in your urine and that would um severely influence our management So after doing that, I would like to start you on some medications. Magnesium sulfate. I don't know if you are familiar. You must have had that in your previous pregnancy. You want to put on magnesium sulfate to prevent you from having any fits or seizures. Right. And then, like I said, we would put you on blood pressure medications also. So with those two, we hope that you'll be fine and will be able to continue this pregnancy. We'd also want to give you some steroids so that your baby's lungs can develop faster should in case we have to deliver a child. However, you should know that this condition puts you at the risk of having a cesarean section because if in any case you are not able to control your blood pressure properly, it is very important that we deliver you of this child. So we put you on steroids so that's for adventure we have to deliver your child before 10. i'm aware i'm sure you must be aware that 10 is 37 weeks and you are 37 you are 30 weeks currently so in case we can't get you to 37 weeks we we want your child's lung to have matured enough. And that would be the reason for putting you on steroids. Are you following me, ma? Hello, ma. Can you hear me, ma? Hello? Hello? All right, so if you have any questions, please let me know. Not at all, doctor. Not at all. All right. I think that will be the end."

Since we got married, me and my husband, we can meet, like, four times in a week. We have intercourse about three to four times average, every week.

All right. So, have you noticed any neck swelling recently? No. Do you notice whether you shake? Do you notice whether you've been having tremors? No, not at all. OK Do you notice whether you feel erm… any history of erm… heat or told cold intolerance?

So any previous histories of termination of pregnancy, whether voluntary, or any miscarriages in the past? No, that's all. OK, so do you have any medical conditions yourself say hypertension, Diabetes. No, they've never told me I was diabetic. But I know one time when we went to do tests in my… the sugar, I cannot remember the value now but it was… they said it was on the borderline that I need to watch it. OK. So that that's suggesting that you’re pre diabetic Something like that, they said I should watch it and my sugar was on the high side that day. OK, how about your how about your family members do you know anybody who is diabetic? Yes, my mom is diabetic Your mom is diabetic. OK, All right. So how long have you been married with your husband? erm...We married for about two years now, about two years but we've been trying to have children for… ‘cause we got married maybe 2022. Yes.

You and your husband, Both of you. Do you… Do you both drink? Yeah. When we go out once in a while you know, for partying and all of that, we used to drink. All right. So, I'll still ask you some series of other questions just to make sure we did not miss out any other important details. OK, Sir. All right. So, any cough? No. Chest pain or Breathlessness? No. No, All right. Any headaches? Any blurring of vision? No, Not at all. No visual disturbances? No. OK. So, also very important, do you lactate? Have you been having any Milky discharge? From my breast? From your breast Yes. No. No. OK. Any abdominal pain? No. Any… Any Constipation? No. Any leg swelling? Not at all. Palpitations. Palpitations, No. All right. All right. OK. So uhm, basically uhm from your history, I… the history you're giving me is highly suggestive that you have a medical condition uhm… called PCOS and that's short for polycystic ovarian syndrome. Uhm… And that's because of the… that's because of your inability to conceive and the irregular menstruation coupled with the fact that you have uhm an unusual hair distribution pattern and then your… you uhm, your fasting blood sugar like you said is uhm… suggestive that you're pre diabetic and that's associated with the condition. So we are going to uhm… send you to the lab to do some couple of tests and basically just to confirm what I'm thinking about uhm… and then to rule out other causes, other possible causes of infertility uhm.., usually another close 'cause that I think you might have would be primary ovarian failure, right? Uhm  So basically we would send you for the test just to make sure that uhm… we rule out this other condition. So the test that you'll be doing would involve a repeat of your fasting blood sugar, right. OK And possibly a 2 hours, 2 hour post pandial, So meaning that you'll take your blood sample before you eat and then two hours after you eat and then compare, right. Then we'd also want to do a hormonal profile, right? So, take your blood sample to check for some hormones that we think are in control of your ovulation. So, we'll be checking for your follicle… FSH, LH, you don't really need to worry about these terms, but basically just for you to have an idea of what we are talking about. So, we check for the hormones that control your ovulation, right? And then we'd also send you for an ultrasound scan to check your ovaries basically, which is usually the most confirmatory test that is available to us to diagnose whether or not you actually have polycystic ovarian syndrome, right. OK, Sir. Basically that would be it for the investigations and then for the treatment once the results come out and we confirm that this is the condition you have, would want to most likely place you on an oral hypoglycemic agent, Metformin, you might be familiar with that, most diabetic patients use that, so that would help in controlling the weight gain and your sensitivity to insulin, right. And then for your acne, we'd want to put you on some uhm… topical medications, mostly creams that you can apply that would uhm… reduce or curb the the the acne. So basically, Isotretinoin cream and benzoyl peroxide. So, what you do is to apply the benzoyl peroxide face wash in the morning and then uhm… use a face wash afterwards and then while use a face wash afterwards and then at night… At night… you then you go about your day as usual or you have to wear a sunscreen, that's very important. And then at night, you can use the tretinoin cream after using your face wash before you go to sleep, right. So that takes care of the acne. Do you have any other problems in particular that you might want us to talk about? Not at all, Sir. But if we do all these things, so I'll be able to get pregnant. Yes, yes. Uhm… Well, also I uhm mentioned earlier that it involves an ovulation problem. So basically, it will be advisable for us to put you on a drug, clomifene citrates. That drug would help with uhm…  ovulation because basically one of the problems you're having is that you're not sending enough eggs for fertilization. So placing you on that drug would help you with ovulation to make sure that you have enough eggs for sperm to fertilize after sexual intercourse. So we place you on that drug, and then hopefully, you should be able to get pregnant. Thank you, Sir. All right, So, do you have any questions for me or do you have any Gray areas that you might want me to clarify? Not at all, Sir All right, So I think that would be the end of the consultation for today. If you have any concerns, you can please let us know. No problem, Sir.

So, do you have any questions? No. Okay. So, do you have any questions? No. Okay. So, do you have any questions? No no at all okay so do you have any medical conditions yourself say hypertension diabetes no they've never told me i was diabetic but i know one time when we went to do tests, the sugar I cannot remember the value now but it was it said it was on the borderline that I need to watch it. Okay, so that's suggesting that you are pre-diabetic. Something like that. They said I should watch it, that my sugar was on the high side. Okay. How about your family members? Do you know anybody who is diabetic? Yes, my mom is diabetic. Your mom is diabetic? Yeah. Okay. All right. So, how long have you been married with your husband? We've been married for over two years, now about two years, but we've been trying to have children for, because we got married in the mid-20s, 22. Yes. We both live together. Yes, we live together. We live together. Okay. Yes. All so how do you know whether he takes alcohol does he drink me me or my husband you and your husband both of you do you both drink yeah when we go out once in a while you know for partying and all of that we used to drink. So, I'll still ask you some series of other questions just to make sure you did not miss out any other important details. Okay, sir. All right. So, any cough? No. Chest pain or breathlessness? No. No. All right. Any headaches? Any brain ovation? No, not at all. No visual disturbances? No. Okay. So, also very important. Do you have any milky discharge? On my breast? On your breast, yes. No. No. Okay. Any abdominal pain? No abdominal pain? No. Any constipation? No. Any leg swelling? Not at all. Palpitations? Palpitations? No. All right. All right. Okay. So, basically, from your history, the history you've given me is highly suggestive that you have a medical condition called PCOS. And that's short for polycystic ovarian syndrome. And that's because of the. That's because of your. Inability to conceive and the irregular menstruation coupled with the fact that you have an unusual air distribution pattern and then your fasting blood sugar, like you said, is suggesting that you are pre-diabetic and that's associated with the condition. So we are going to send you to the lab to do some couple of tests and basically just to confirm what I'm thinking about. And then to rule out other causes, other possible causes of infertility. Usually another close cause that I think you might have would be pulmonary ovarian failure. right so um basically we would send you for the test just to make sure that um we roll out this other condition so the test that you've been doing would involve a repeat of your fasting blood sugar okay and possibly a two hours two hour postponement So meaning that'll take your blood sample before you eat and then two hours after you eat and then compare, right? Then we'd also want to do hormonal profile, right? So take your blood sample to check for some hormones that we think are in control of your ovulation. So we'll be checking for your follicle FSH, LH. You don't really need to worry about these things, but basically just for you to have an idea of what we are talking about. So we check for the hormones that control your ovulation, right? And then we'd also send you for an ultrasound scan to check your ovaries basically which is usually the most confirmatory test that is available so as to diagnose whether or not you actually have polycystic ovarian syndrome right thank you so basically that would be it for the investigations. And then for the treatment, once the results come out and we confirm that this is the condition you have, we would want to most likely place you on an oral hypoglycemic agent, metformin. You might be familiar with that most diabetic patients use that so that would help in controlling the weight gain and your sensitivity to insulin right and then for your acne we want to put you on some um topical medications mostly creams that you can apply that would reduce or curb the acne. So basically, iso-39 cream and benzoyl peroxide. So what you do is to apply the benzoyl peroxide face wash in the the morning and then use a face wash afterwards and then while use a fish was afterwards and then at night at night you then you go about your day as usual or you have to wear sunscreen that's very important and then at night you can use the 39 cream after using your face wash before you go to sleep right so that takes care of the acne do you have any other problems in particular that you might want us to talk about not at all sir but if we do all these things i'll be able to get pregnant yes yes um well also i mentioned earlier that it involves an ovulation problem so basically it would be advisable for us to put you on a drug chromethane secret that drug would help with um ovulation because basically one of the problems you're having is that you're not sending enough eggs for fertilization. So placing on that drug would help you with ovulation to make sure that you have enough eggs for sperm to fertilize after sexual intercourse. So place you on that drug and then hopefully you should be able to get pregnant. Thank you, sir. All right. So do you have any questions for me? Or do you have any gray areas that you might want me to clarify? Not at all, sir. All right. All right. So I think that will be the end of the consultation for today. If you have any concerns, you can please let us know no problem all right"

P: Yeah, my family's definitely been helping me out a lot over these past few weeks because. Yeah, like I said, like I'm having some weakness in my legs. I can't move around as much because I'm in so much pain. Um and then like there are all these like bladder accidents so. Yeah, they've been helping me out with everyday things. 

D: OK, I see. And currently, do you smoke?

P: No.

D: OK, do you drink alcohol?

P: No, just like how can I fix this?

D: Yeah, so based on your symptoms, it's something that's pretty urgent. It's seems like you may be having something called cauda Equina syndrome that may be caused by your back pain and that's why you're feeling that groin would be called saddle anesthesia and then the urinary incontinence. So this may be from the injury that you had with the car accident. And it may be due to some compression of what we call like compression of the nerves in the area which might be giving you some of these symptoms. So the first thing we do need to do is get an MRI of your lower back just to make sure there's nothing going on like for example, like any masses in the area or any kind of abscesses that might be. We may be worried about just to make sure. Well, just to see what's going on in there that's causing these symptoms. And then based on what we find, uh, we will, we will target like the cause of the symptoms, like for example if it's an infect infection that's causing this, you might need to be admitted and require antibiotics. If there is any masses causing it, you may require surgery. For example if it's mainly related to your back it is something that we will have to treat with with an admission so it's good that you came in here today. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

P: No, that was it. Thank you so much for your help.

It seems like you may be having something called C cauda equina syndrome that may be caused by your back pain and that's why you're feeling the groin what we call saddle anesthesia and then the urinary incontinence so this may be from the injury that you had with a car accident and it may be due to some compression of what we call like compression of the nerves in the area which might be giving you some of these symptoms so the first thing we do need to do is get an MRI of your lower back just to make sure there's nothing um going on like for example like any masses in the area or any kind of abscesses that might be we may be worried about just to make sure um well just to see what's going on in there that's causing these symptoms. And then based on what we find, we will, we will target like the cause of these symptoms. Like for example, if it's an infection that's causing this, you might need to be admitted and require antibiotics. If there's any masses causing it, you may require surgery, for example. If it's mainly related to your back, it is something that we will have to treat with an admission. So it's good that you came in here today. Do you have any other questions or concerns? No, that was it. Thank you so much for your help. You're welcome. And we'll get back to you shortly."
RES0068,data/final_audio/RES0068.mp3,"D: So what brings you in here today?

D: Constipation or diarrhea?

P: No.

D: Any issues with urinating?

P: No, no issues there.

D: OK, is there anything that helps you at all that you've tried?  

P: Like just the positions of how I'm sleeping sometimes helps, yeah.

D: OK. Alright, yeah, so those are all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions at all for me?

P: Uh, no, what was like, what do you think I have?

D: Yeah, so from the symptoms that you're describing, it does seem more like sinus issues. There's a sinus behind your face and what can happen is if you get an infection, like all the the mucous and everything can build up and increase the pressure. That's the pressure you're feeling underneath your face.  It's because of a sinus infection most likely. And usually like, it's usually like a viral infection that can go away on its own. We usually ask patients to try the nasal rinses, and then some oral decongestents. Or have you tried any anti histamines?

P: No, I haven't. 

D: OK, so no antihistamines. It seems most likely that you have a sinus infection. It can be bacterial with the yellow discharge that you're having as well. So we can give you some antibiotics, so will give you some. Amoxicillin. 

P: Sure.

D: So it's only been three day since you're having these symptoms, right?  And you haven't had any high fever or anything like that? Have you measured your temperature?

P: I haven't, I haven't, no. 

D: OK.

P: I don't feel hot though.

D: OK, since it's been three days, what I'm going to do is still give you some antibiotics so Amoxicillin and then we'll see like after you finish that dose how you feel. And will set up another appointment for when we can do like a phone appointment and or clinic appointment when your doses are done. Does that sound good?

P: Yeah that sounds great. Thank you. 

D: OK, you're welcome and hopefully you feel better.

P: Thank you.

D: Take care.

D: OK, and, do you purchase those at a dispensary?

P: I do.

D: OK, so for one of the Ontario stores?

P: Yes. 

D: OK great yeah 'cause you could never be sure where else, what the dosing is, so it's good to get it from the appropriate stores for sure.

P: Right.

D: Do you drink alcohol?

P: I do, I'll have a glass of wine with dinner.

D: OK is this daily?

P: Um most days I would say, maybe like four or five days of the seven days of the week.

D: OK, I see. And has anybody in your family had similar symptoms in the past to what you're having or had any lung conditions in the past?

P: No, nothing like that.

D: OK, how about any heart conditions?

P: Um, my father passed away at 75 from a heart attack.

D: OK, and uh, how about any cancers in the family?

P: None that I know of.

D: OK. So I think that was, uh, all of the questions that I wanted to ask on history today. Was there anything else that you thought I was missing or that you wanted to tell me about?

P: No, I don't think so. But, uh, what do you think I have?

D: So with the acuity of your symptoms, starting with the last few days and getting worse, especially with a fever which we now have documented of 38.8 and a kind of feeling, uh, tired with aches and pains and the headache, I am concerned that you have possibly a viral infection, and one of those possibilities could be COVID-19, but also it could be the influenza. It could be something like the common cold, such as adenovirus. So certainly we will do a PCR COVID swab as well as order some general lab work to look for signs of infection, such as a CBC and a white blood cell count. But um, for now we will get those tests ordered. Did you have any questions?

P: OK yeah that sounds great. Do you think I could also have you know, meningitis or something? 'Cause I was reading online on Google and that's the first thing that came up.

D: Oh yeah, you're you're absolutely right, so, um sorry, I we will go ahead and investigate that as well and we might need to do a lumbar puncture or some blood work to look for signs of infection that might be needed to be treated with antibiotics.

P: OK, alright that sounds good, thank you.",785.2908125,us_medical,"I was wondering if you could tell me what brought you in. Sure.

No, I don't think so, but what do you think I have? So with the acuity of your symptoms starting within the last few days and getting worse, especially with a fever which we now have documented of 38.8 and kind of feeling tired with aches and pains and a headache, you're concerned that you have possibly a viral infection and one of those possibilities could be COVID-19 but also could be the flu the influenza it could be something like the common cold such as adenovirus so certainly we will do a PCR COVID swab as well as order some general lab work to look for signs of infection such as a CBC and a white blood cell counts, but for now we'll get those tests ordered. Did you have any questions? Okay, yeah, that sounds great. Do you think I could also have meningitis or something? Because I was reading online on Google and that's the first thing that came up. Oh yeah, you're absolutely right. So, Sorry, we will go ahead and investigate that as well and we might need to do a lumbar puncture or some blood work to look for signs of infection that might be needed to be treated with antibiotics.

RES0202,data/final_audio/RES0202.mp3,"D: What brings you all in today?

P: Hi. So I just brought in my son he's 5. Essentially, when he, so today is Friday when he got home from school on Wednesday, he seemed fine, but he I don’t know that night he started to have a bit of like a cough. It just seemed like a little dry cough, but obviously I just wanted to keep him home, keep him safe and not like spread anything if he was sick. So he stayed at home on Thursday and he was like having a bit of a cough. Then yesterday it seemed to get a little bit worse and he was really tired, uh sorry. Today, today is Friday. He was like his cough is like getting a bit worse and I've been taking his temp the whole time and it got like a little high today, what was it? My thermometer says it was high. I'm just like trying to remember it was it was. It was like over 100 though. 

D: Oh OK. 

P: Uh, 101 or something or maybe 100.1 if. But anyways it was so I I just thought I should probably bring him in 'cause I was really worried about him and you know so he could have maybe got covid and like at school or something.

D: Yeah for sure. Um OK, so just to clarify, he's had this cough and fever for the past five five days. 

P: Mhm.

D: OK, OK so let's focus on the cough.

P: It’s Friday. Its been more like like 3 days.  Wednesday is when he came home, and then um he. And then today is Friday. So yeah, sorry. 

D: Today is Friday OK. And um. OK, yeah sure uh so. Is this cough a productive cough, or is it kind of a dry cough?

P: Uh I think it's dry. I haven't noticed him like spitting up anything. Yeah he yeah, its just like little cough.

D: OK, And. He is he. He's not bringing up any sputum or blood?

P: No.

D: No OK good. OK, and does he sound wheezy at all to you?

P: No, no, not that I've noticed.

D: OK, how about short of breath?

P: Um I don't think so like he usually he's a really active kid and he has. He hasn't been running a lot outside in the past couple of days, so maybe he maybe he could have been having a harder time breathing. But also I think he's just been tired in general.

D: OK, yeah. OK, Uhm. Is his coughing getting worse with certain times of the day? Like is it worse at night, in the morning?

P: Mm I think it kinda just there the whole day.

D: OK, and it does it, how does it sound? Does this sound like a barky cough? Does it sound? Uhm? Like harsh, what is what would you say the quality of it, of the sound of the cough is?

P: Uh, I, just sounds kind of dry. It's not like super loud. 

D: OK. OK, and has he ever experienced anything like this in the past?

P: Um like he's had colds before, but I haven't like. I haven't like you this time he kind of had the fever, which is different than you know, having a regular cold. 

D: OK. And are his symptoms getting worse?

P: I think so 'cause yeah, the first day he just seemed like a little dry and then yesterday is coughing and today he actually has a fever.

D: OK, and is he complaining of anything like chest pain? Or feeling like his heart's racing?

P: No, I don't think so. 

D: No, OK. Does he have a sore throat?

P: Mm I don't think so.

D: OK, and is he having any issues swallowing food or fluids? 

P: I don't know if he's having trouble swallowing, but he doesn't seem to have a big appetite right now.

D: OK, and is he, does he have a blocked nose or runny nose?

P: Maybe a bit of like a look at runny nose.

D: OK, and does he have any issues with smell or taste?

P: He, this morning he really seemed like he wasn't like into his breakfast and I wonder if he's losing his sense of taste a little bit.

D: OK, how about vision or hearing?

P: I think those are fine. 

D: OK, and is he complaining of any chills or night sweats?

P: No. 

D: OK, any changes in his hair, nails or skin like rashes? 

P: No, I haven't noticed anything like that.

D: Any changes in his bowel movements. Pardon? 

P: Um sorry no changes.

D: OK, no diarrhea, no constipation, no blood in the stool?

P: No 

D: OK, any nausea or vomiting?

P: No. 

D: OK, any changes in his urine?

P: I haven’t really been looking, but I don't think so.

D: Any dizziness or fainting spells?

P: No, just like fatigue.

D: OK, any confusion or memory loss?

P: No. 

D: And is he and is he an otherwise healthy child?

P: Yeah, actually he hasn't decided to like a vaccine that he hasn't had to go to the doctor like ever like. I mean, he broke his arm once, but that was it.

D: OK, um so no past illnesses and I guess no hospitalizations or surgeries except for the broken arm.

P: Exactly, like nothing. 

D: OK, and were things normal with your pregnancy with him?

P: Yeah totally. 

D: OK um. And then how about as a newborn, any complications after birth?

P: No, no, like everything is things really good.

D: OK, and then did he hit all his milestones up till now? 

P: Yeah totally. 

D: OK. Any, does he have any allergies?

P: Um. No, no, I don't think so. I mean like he hasn't really taken a lot of medicine, so it's hard to say, but like nothing.

D: Is he up to date with all his immunizations?

P: Yeah. 

D: Yeah OK. And. In terms of family history, are there any lung conditions or heart conditions?

P: Uh no everyone is really healthy.

D: OK, and. And are there and who does he live with and where does he live? 

P: Um he lives with just me and my husband, and he has a little sister, like this in town here.

D: OK and, is she healthy?

P: Yeah, I think she, yeah she's healthy.

D: OK um? Any concerns for old carpets, mold, asbestos or any environmental issues like that in the home that you're in?

P: No. 

D: No, OK. Has he been around any sick contacts recently?

P: Not, not like outside of school. I like we know for sure, not outside of school, um but he goes to school right now so. Kinda hard to say. 

D: OK. 

P: But they haven't. They haven't like contacted us about anything. 

D: OK, sure. And has he traveled anywhere recently?

P: No. 

D: No OK. OK, well those are all the questions I had for you today. Were, was there anything that I missed that you wanted to chat about today?

P: I don't think so. Um, like I, I realized that I can often times like you don't really do much for kids when you know when it's just like a virus or something. But we do, I guess need to have a covid test to go back to the school, even if you know either way 'cause they want us to be able to say. It's like the other kids have had an exposure.

D: Yeah for 

P: yeah, like. Sorry, go ahead, 

D: No go ahead.

P: I’m just basically wanted to see if it was bad. I mean he doesn't receive your so scared. That's kind of what makes him in like it's gonna be a little bit.

D: Right, yeah, OK, so first thing is, first we need to do a covid swab just to make sure that he either has it or it doesn't have it and those results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. Um we do suggest because his symptoms are allowed with symptoms of covid that he isolate for 14 days and that includes from his his younger sister possible. And then if the swab comes back negative, there is a chance for false negatives. But also it could be another viral illness that's going around nowadays, and if his symptoms get worse, so if he has a really high temperature, if he has any neurological symptoms, like seizures or. If he's feeling weak, dizzy if he has any fainting spells, please do take him to the ER and. And so for now I'll just wait for those covid swaps to come back. How does that sound?

P: Yeah, sounds good.

D: OK great yeah, yeah no worries and. I I should have mentioned if it was just the cough or if he was just short of breath or something like that and he didn't have the fever, we would add other things like asthma to the list of things he could be worked up for, but um right now it sounds like it sounds like an infection.

P: OK yeah, that's good to know.

D: Alright, sounds great. Have a good day.

D: OK and uh in the family, are there any musculoskeletal or neurological conditions?

P: Um no.

D: OK, um. And so that I that was everything I wanted to ask on history. So for the physical exam, when inspecting the knee, are you seeing any joint effusions or joint swelling or ecchymosis or bruising?

P: It looks or is that a bruise, it looks red and I would say it's a little bit swollen on the medial aspect only.

D: OK, is there any muscle atrophy?

P: Um no. 

D: OK, and is there any misalignment or joint deformities?

P: No, not that I notice. 

D: OK. And alright on gait or walking, is there any limp or antalgia? 

P: Um no.

D: You're able to walk normally?

P: I am able to walk normally and it hurts, but I think I'm walking OK. 

D: OK. Uhm and next is there any changes to temperature like the joint itself feel hot?

P: No. 

D: OK and are there any areas of the joint line itself of the knee that is painful to palpation?

P: At just the medial part of it like the I guess where the ligament would be.

D: OK, so just let me OK, and, any pain over the patella?

P: No. 

D: Any pain over the tibial tuberosity or patellar tendon?

P: No.

D: Any pain over your over the fibular head or the lateral part of the knee?

P: No.

D: Any pain in the calf or the thigh muscles?

P: No.

D: Any pain in the hamstring muscles?

P: No.

D: OK, and is there any pain to a like varus stress of the knee?

P: To the varus stress? I guess it would be, there will be pain if I press down in that area.

D: OK, and is there any joint yeah, the joint laxity or pain too, like a valgus stress of the knee?

P: Yeah, so when I press when I do that it hurts on the medial aspect but not the lateral aspect. 

D: OK. Uhm and does it feel is as though there's some like the joints opening more when you put the valgus stress? 

P: A little bit, yes.

D: OK. Uhm and is there any instability moving the tibia anteriorly, if you're like, pull it outwards?

P: Um no.

D: And how about if you pull the tibia posteriorly, any instability?

P: No. 

D: OK, um and the is their full range of motion of the knee?

P: Yes.

D: And full range of motion of the hip and ankle?

P: Yes. 

D: OK, um and do you have any like numbness, tingling or muscle weakness? 

P: No.

D: OK, and any sensory changes to the skin?

P: No, no.

D: OK and reflexes are normal. 

P: Mmmm

D: OK. So I think that was everything I wanted to ask and and kind of go through on the physical exam. Did you have any other questions or anything that maybe I forgot to mention today?

P: Ah no, that was it. Just what can I do about my my knee?

D: Yeah, so right now it's sounding like this could be an MCL or medial collateral ligament strain, or injury and so these types of injuries are usually treated conservatively, like with things like NSAIDs or anti-inflammatories to help that pain and swelling. If the pain depending on how severe it is, it might be useful to use maybe crutches for a day or two to try to help let the pain to subside and allow you to be able to do some physical therapy exercises like strengthening the quadriceps and hamstring muscles. 

P: OK.

D: But typically injuries that are lower grade will heal within two weeks and so if it's more more severe, it could take a bit longer. And although that it's most likely an MCL injury that you're describing, it could be a medial meniscal injury as well or possibly even a bursitis at the medial aspect of the knee. But the treatment to start with would be the same and maybe we will get any x-ray if things aren't improving.

Okay. uh loss of her sense of taste or smell no okay um any recent travel uh no no um any contact with anyone who has been sick recently uh she has a younger brother that goes to daycare and I know those kids can be sick all the time, but her brother's been okay. Okay. Does she complain of any kind of headaches or nausea or vomiting? No, she doesn't. Okay. Have you noticed any fevers or chills? No. Okay. Any night sweats? No. Okay. Any changes in her bowel movements like constipation or diarrhea? No, she hasn't had any changes like that. Okay. And any kind of changes in her sleep or appetite?

Yeah, there are animals at home. Okay. And how long have you had them? For about just under a year. So, yeah yeah just under a year so yeah just under a year okay um okay has she been diagnosed at all with any medical conditions in the past um no no when she was born she had to uh go and uh be observed for a few, a couple of days for jaundice. She didn't need to have any therapy for it. It went away on its own, but that's about it. Okay. And any complications during your pregnancy with her? No, everything was normal. And it was a vaginal delivery at term. Okay. Any issues with the development? Was she meeting her milestones and her growth, meeting her muscles on her growth chart as well? Yeah. All of that has been normal. okay um any allergies to medications or environmental factors that you know not to um any medications that i'm aware of but um she hasn't been tested but she does get symptoms that i kind of change with um seasons like she'll get a runny nose and and some itchy eyes at different times throughout the year okay okay any medications that she has been on at all so when that happens like, she'll just take a, like, a reactant or, like, I don't know, something like that, but just an allergy pill.

No, I just wanted to figure out what was going on with this um cough okay yeah so it seems like these symptoms have been going on for a few months now it seems that she gets them on exertion and um they're worsened by exertion um at this age um one thing that definitely we want to check is if she has asthma. She does have some other symptoms that are associated with asthma. It seems that she gets some irritation through environmental factors as well. So what we'll do for her is get something called a pulmonary function test for her to see if she in fact has asthma or not. And then based on that, we will see if she needs any puffers that can help relieve some of her symptoms. And lastly, since she's having a cough, we'll also do like a COVID test just in case as well. Okay. Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you. Yeah, and no worries. And then we'll also do like a full physical examination. That sounds great. All right. Okay."

D: Yeah, so definitely. That's something that's at the top of our head right now, especially due to his age and the symptoms that he's been having after exertion in particular. And the family history of asthma as well. So definitely that's something that we want to investigate. So what we'll do for him is first, we'll do like a full physical examination. Listen to his alongs. And just assess his breathing and then afterwards we will order some tests for him, so he's six years old, right?

P: He is yes.


D: OK, so we'll see if we can do something called a pulmonary function test. Sometimes it depends on the child 
if they're able to follow instructions, and so that test requires a completely breathing out and following some instructions during the test. So since he's six, he might be able to do that. We we can try that. And then afterwards we'll see if he requires anything like an allergy testing or we will we might need to help manage his symptoms with a puffer, for example, like Ventilin and an  inhaled Cortico steroid, but those are just some discussions will have in the near future after we've done all these investigations.

P: OK, great, thank you.

Yeah, sometimes he'll have a bit of a cough and you can hear a wheeze sometimes after. It goes away relatively quickly, like within 30 to 60 minutes. And but yeah. Okay. Any past medical conditions that he's been diagnosed with? No, he just had that episode of, I think, bronchiolitis when he was young, but that was it. Okay. Any medications that he has to take regularly? No. No. Any allergies to any medications? No. No. Any allergies to any environmental or food factors? Um, no, I don't think so. Okay. Has he had any rashes at all previously? Um, no, he hasn't had any rashes. Okay. Okay. And, um, any hospitalizations or surgeries? Nope. Okay. And any family history of any heart or lung conditions, any history of asthma at all? um yeah his mom has a um has asthma um and she uses uh an inhaler daily for it okay um has when did uh the mom get diagnosed with asthma was it during childhood yeah she was younger um ever since i've known her she's she's had um she's had asthma hasn't had um any real i guess exacerbations that that i've noticed or been able to control her symptoms with um with inhalers okay and um for him uh how many times would you say he's having these episodes in an average week now? I would say two. Two. And is he getting any of these symptoms at nighttime, like waking up? He is, yeah. It is happening at night. Okay. And then has he missed any days of school due to this? yeah um he's missed a couple of days in the past month because he just didn't sleep well and then not feeling good the next day. So, yeah, he has. Okay. Yeah so And any Issues with The mother's pregnancy With him Um, yeah, so, and any, uh, issues with, uh, um, the mother's pregnancy with him at all? No, she, she's healthy and, um, the delivery was at term with a, uh, normal body weight, um, or birth weight rather. And he, um, he was healthy, uh, when he was born. no prolonged uh stay in the nicu or hospital after that no he was able to go home luckily okay um and uh afterwards has he been meeting all his milestones like his motor uh gross motor fine motor social skills and growth and all of those. Has he been meeting them well? He has, yeah. He's been meeting all of his milestones and growing well. Okay. And any at all issues from the school in terms of learning difficulties or anything like that? No, he's been uh in school okay that's good um does he have any siblings um no he's uh it's just him he's the only child okay and what's uh the home situation like who does he live with so it's uh myself and um my wife which is his mom and um so it's just us three and we live in a um in a house okay uh and anyone in the household uh does anyone smoke at all no there aren't any smokers in the home okay and. And any new carpets or any dust or mold or anything like that in the house? There is a carpet in the basement. He uses that as his playroom sometimes. Okay. Okay. Yeah, so those are all the questions I had. Do you have any questions at all? Um, yeah, I was just wondering, um, like if this could be maybe asthma as well. Yeah. So definitely that's something that's, uh, at the top of our head right now, especially only, uh, due to his age and the symptoms that he's been having after exertion in particular, and the family history of asthma as well. So definitely that's something that we want to investigate. So what we'll do for him is first we'll do like a full physical examination, listen to his lungs, and just assess his breathing. And then afterwards, we will order some tests for him. So he's six years old, right? He is, yes. Okay, so we'll see if we can do something called a pulmonary function test. Sometimes it depends on the child if they're able to follow instructions. And so that test requires completely breathing out and following some instructions during the test. So since he's six, he might be able to do that. We can try that. and then afterwards we'll see if he requires anything like an allergy testing or um we will we might need um to help manage his symptoms with a puffer for example uh like ventolin and inhaled corticosteroid but those are just some discussions we'll have in the near future after we've done all these investigations. Okay, great. Thank you. You're welcome. Take care. Bye."

D: Okay, um, and I, sometimes people that, kind of in this age group, might experience with either drugs or alcohol. Have any of your friends done that or, or yourself?

P: I know like some of my friends have uh, tried alcohol and try marijuana, but I haven't experimented yet.

D: Okay, that's good and um, I, that's all I wanted to ask today on history. Was there anything else that you wanted to add?

P: Oh, nothing that I want to add. I just, what do you, how do you think I can make this, make my voice better? And how long will I have, have this horse voice?

D: Yeah, so uh, right now it's sounding like um, a viral type illness where there's inflammation of the vocal cords, uh, with having the cough and the runny nose a couple of days ago. Actually, this reminds me that. Have you, I'm not sure if I asked about fevers or chills, if you have any?

P: Uh no, I haven't.

D: Okay, um, and so for, if it is a viral infection then, um, it's just supportive kind of management. So that will mean trying to stay as hydrated as you possibly can over these next um, next few days and then also you can use things like, if they help, like lozenges or something along those lines. Um, but it will, it will just take some time for it to come back on its own, a few days to a couple of weeks sometimes. And the cough could possibly last for um, two to four weeks after um, after having a viral type illness.

P: Okay.

D: Yeah, so it could be quite a few weeks that the symptoms last for. But since you're having a cough, and these symptoms could overlap with COVID we'll want to get a COVID swab today as well um, and kind of go from there.

P: No, I was told I didn't need any any yet, but if I didn't quit smoking I might in the future. 

D: OK, and are you using any kind of puffers at all?

P: Yeah, I I do I I use I think it's called like Spiriva or something like that. I use that every day and there's another one that I'll use like if my symptoms are getting bad. My blue one. I did try that actually last night and it didn't, it helped a little bit, but, not not enough.

Yeah, I think it's there kind of most of the time, like the chest pressure. I kind of feel it throughout my chest when I'm breathing, but also just kind of sitting here, I can kind of feel it. Okay, I see. And are all of your symptoms constant or do they come and go? They've been constant and they've been getting worse since last night. Okay, and have you, has this happened to you before? It has, yeah. Actually, last winter I was hospitalized for a COPD exacerbation for a few days. I know I got some antibiotics and I needed some oxygen. I see. And did you go home on home oxygen at all? Like, do you use oxygen at home? No, I was told I didn't need any yet, but if I didn't quit smoking, I might in the future. And are you using any kind of puffer at all? Yeah, I do. I use, I think it's called like Spiriva or something like that. I use that every day.

Okay, so have you just tried it one time last night? Have you tried it after that? Yeah, we just tried it last night. Okay, so nothing today, right? No, nothing today.

P: Yeah, he's pretty healthy. There have been no concerns at all that we've had for the doctor. Uh he's been growing well, um meeting all of his milestones. Um yeah, no, nothing that's concerning.

D: OK, um do you know if his mother's pregnancy with him was normal? Did she have any complications?

P: Um she didn't have any like complications during the pregnancy. Uh they did have to, um I forgot what it's called, but uh he was like a difficult baby coming out. Um and he was at term though, he wasn't premature, but they had to use just um some tools to get him out.

D: OK, OK. Um so it was a vaginal delivery, but they used some tools like forceps maybe or vacuum?

P: Yeah, yeah it was forceps, yeah.

D: OK, OK. Um and he's, you mentioned he was full term?

P: Yeah, he was born at uh 40 weeks.

D: OK, perfect. Did he need to be hospitalized for any reason after that?

D: OK, and how are things at home, um is like, are things financially stable? Any relationship issues?

P: No, we've been pretty uh fortunate like it it's, no financial issues uh and we have a lot of support from our parents as well. Uh the relationship is great, so no, no issues.

D: OK, good good. Um has he had any sick contacts recently?

P: Um I don't think so. He's, we've been at home so I don't know. We we did have like, with our with my brother's uh kids like uh they came to see us once um but that was like, that was, I think at like three weeks ago.

D: OK, OK, three weeks ago. Alright, um travel to anywhere recently?

P: No.

D: No, OK. Alright, those were all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions that you wanted to ask me today before we end the interview?

P: Uh no, not really. Just wanted to know if, like I remember he did need antibiotics before so I was just wondering if he needs them now.

D: Yeah, um so, well first, because some of his symptoms overlap with Covid, like the fever especially, we'll do a swab on him anyways um and you should hear those results in about 24 to 48 hours. Um and then it, this picture sounds like acute otitis media, so like an ear infection. And um it's especially likely because he's had them in the past, so I'm gonna have to take a look into his ears first before like um coming up with a management plan. But I'll kind of walk you through what we look at. So if I take a look and I see like a perforated tympanic membrane with like pus, we'd prescribe like 10 days of um antibiotics. If he has some like middle ear effusion, so like some fluids with like a bulging tympanic membrane and he appears to be really ill, uh which from the sounds of it, he sounds ill, he's had this fever for more than two days, we'll also prescribe antibiotics for 10 days. And then, if it's just some middle ear effusion, so just that clear fluid um or just the bulging tympanic membrane, we can just um reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see how he's doing. And if he's worse, again, we'll prescribing prescribe him some antibiotics. Um the antibiotics that we usually prescribe are amoxicillin, and because he doesn't have a penicillin allergy, that should work.

P: OK.

D: Yeah, how does that sound?

P: That sounds good. Thank you so much.

D: OK, great, thank you.",711.765625,us_medical,"What brings you in? Yeah, so I'm just bringing my son here to the clinic.

Any relationship issues? No, and we've been pretty fortunate. Like, it's no financial issues and we have a lot of support from our parents as well. The relationship is great, so no issues. Okay, good, good. Has he had any sick contacts recently? I don't think so. He's been at home, so I don't know. We did have, like, with my brother's kids, they came to see us once, but that was like, I think, like three weeks ago. Okay. Okay, three weeks ago. All right. Um, traveled to anywhere recently? No. No, okay. All right, those were all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions that you wanted to ask? me today before we end the interview? No, not really. Just wanted to know if, like, I remember he did need antibiotics before so I was just wondering if he needs them now. Yeah, so, well first because some of his symptoms overlap with COVID, like the fever especially, we'll do a swab on him anyways and you should hear those results in about 24 to 48 hours. And then this picture sounds like acute otitis media, so like an ear infection. And it's especially likely because he's had them in the past. So I'm gonna have to take a look into his ears first before like coming up with a management plan, but I'll kind of walk you through what we look at. So if I take a look and see like a perforated tympanic membrane with like pus, we would prescribe like to 10 days of antibiotics. If he has some like middle ear effusion, so like some fluids with like a bulging tympanic membrane and he appears to be really ill, which from the sense of it, he sounds ill, he's had this fever for more than two days, we'll also prescribe antibiotics for 10 days. And then if it's just some middle ear effusion, so just that clear fluid or just the bulging tympanic membrane, we can just reassess him in 24 to 48 hours. 48 hours to see how he's doing and if he's worse again we'll prescribe him some antibiotics. The antibiotics that we usually prescribe are amoxicillin and because he doesn't have a penicillin allergy that should work. Okay. Yeah, how does that sound? That sounds good. Thank you so much. Okay, great. Thank you."," what brings you in yeah so uh i'm just bringing my son uh here to the clinic he's been having um just i think he's been complaining of uh earache and his uh i think it's mainly in his left ear for the last i'd say at least a week um he's been kind of just having discomfort um and over the last few days he also started crying because of how much pain he's having and then um we also noticed that he had like was just feeling warm so we took his temperature and he actually had a fever uh just yesterday of like 39 degrees celsius Okay. All right, so let's back up just a little bit. The ear pain, when did that start? You said a couple of days ago. So was that two, three, four days?

I think we did see some just, like, it wasn't red or anything, but I think we did see some just like it wasn't red or anything but I think we did see some just kind of clear to almost clear to yellowish fluid from his affected ear. Okay clear to you said whitish? Like it was a bit of a yellow tinge to it too as well. Yellow, okay. Okay, and which ear was it? Sorry, the right or left? Left ear. Left ear, okay. And the right ear looks normal? Yeah, right ear, he hasn't been complaining at all. I haven't even looked at the right ear yet. Okay. Is he itching his ears at all? He was itching like pretty much this whole week, but I think right now he's hesitant to even touch his ears. Okay. And does it look like it's angry on the outside or on the inside of his ears? I can't really see anything on the outside. Okay. Okay. And have you noticed that his hearing has changed at all? He still, like, answers to us, and, like, I don't think his hearing is affected.

RES0014,data/final_audio/RES0014.mp3,"D: What brings you in today?

P: This afternoon, I'm just here because I've been experiencing some breathlessness as well as a bit of cough.

D: OK, when did it start?

P: So I think it's a it started around three months ago and I believe it's just been getting worse.

D: OK. Um, how often are you experiencing the shortness of breath?

P: I feel it like a lot of the time, especially outside when I'm in the cold or at at night when I go outside at night, my chest feels a little tight too at the same time.

D: OK, and how long does it last?

P: I would say it lasts up to an hour every time I'm out in the cold and then once I come back in. So I'd say it lasts at least one hour. 

D: OK, does anything else make it worse, like dust? You know, laying down anything like that? 

P: Sometimes when I'm near dust, sometimes when I'm running during gym class, increased activity does make it worse. 

D: OK, OK. And if you were to describe the quality of your breathing difficulties, is it more like a burning kind of feeling? Is it like you can't catch your breath? What does it feel like?

P: I think it's more just a I can't catch my breath and it feels like my my throat is just kind of like closing off and I can't take deep breaths.

D: OK, yeah, that's scary. And one to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is your shortness of breath?

P: It can get up to I would say like an 8 at times. It can get pretty scary. And sometimes, like I feel like heaviness in my chest too when it happens. 

D: Yeah, and the coughing, has it been going on for as long as your breathlessness?

P: I would say around the same same time frame like 3 months, but I'm not always coughing. It comes and goes. 

D: OK, and for your coughing, is it kind of like the same triggers, the cold, dust, things like that? 

P: Yeah, I would say so.

D: And do you ever have do you ever cough up blood?

P: No, I don't. It's mostly just a dry cough. I don't cough up anything. 

D: OK so no sputum or phlegm, no? OK, do you ever feel wheezy?

P: Nope.

D: No? OK. And how about swelling? Have you noticed swelling anywhere in your body?

P: No, nothing like that. 

D: No? OK um, OK, how about um, does your shortness of breath get worse when you're falling asleep?

P: No, nothing like that. 

D: OK, good are you otherwise healthy?

P: Yeah, I don't have any other condition, I I do remember my doctors saying I have hay fever before, but that's about it.

D: When was that? 

P: I think that was like more than three years ago.

D: OK, um, any recent surgeries?

P: No. 

D: No? Are you on any medications?

P: I just take some Tylenol sometimes for the like Tylenol cold, sometimes for the symptoms. I don't think it has really helped.

D: No? OK, do you have any allergies? Not just to medications, but to anything else?

P: Uh just like hay fever but nothing, nothing else that I can think of, no.

D: OK. Um, are you up to date with all your immunizations?

P: As far as I know, yeah everything's up to date.

D: OK, any family history of lung conditions?

P: Uh, don't think so. My sister, I think she they were saying she might have asthma and she also has eczema. No one else in the family has any other conditions. 

D: Not not even like heart conditions, cancer?

P: No, uh no, not that I know. 

D: OK, OK, have you been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently? 

P: No.

D: No, OK, and any travel recently?

P: No, I've been here in Ontario. 

D: OK, and where do you live?

P: So I currently live in London, but I just recently moved into a new flat around two months ago.

D: Two months ago, OK. Um, is it more is it an older flat?

P: Uh, no, it's fairly new. But one thing I did notice, I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but my flatmate actually smokes. Sometimes that can really irritate and make me cough more sometimes at night. 

D: Yeah, any any pets?

P: Oh no, I don't have any pets.

D: OK and and do you smoke?

P: No, I don't smoke, no.

D: OK. And do you smoke marijuana?

P: Nope, never tried marijuana. 

D: OK, any recreational drugs?

P: No, I don't smoke marijuana or cigarettes.

D: OK, how about alcohol? Do you drink alcohol?

P: Um, just like, maybe sometimes at parties, but very rarely. Maybe I would say once a month.

D: OK, OK. Um, and is there anything that you wanted to discuss today that I missed?

P: Uh, so no, I think that that was all like just the shortness of breath was scaring me a lot. But yeah, just the coughing, but other than that I just want to know what's going on. 

D: OK, yeah, and you mentioned you are otherwise healthy so you don't have any history of asthma or anything like that, right? 

P: No, no ones ever told me that, but my sister has asthma, so I was wondering, maybe? 

D: Um, have you ever experienced shortness of breath when you were younger with like exercise?

P: Uh, not really. Just maybe like the normal amount. Like if I'm running around too much, I feel shortness of breath, but I think it just got worse over the last few months. 

D: OK and then have you ever had any imaging done in the past like a chest X-Ray or investigations like a pulmonary function test?

P: No, I don't recall having any of that done. 

D: OK alright well those are all the questions I had for you. If you didn't have anything else to add, I guess we will conclude by saying that what you have, we have a differential diagnosis for this. Um, it sounds like what you have is asthma. Since your symptoms started three months ago when you moved into a flat with your friends, and it seems like this smoking and cold is triggering that and so we'll work you up with a pulmonary function test to start and we'll see if bronchodilators will help with your symptoms. And if it doesn't, we'll also rule out other things like pneumonia or like allergic rhinitis. How does that sound?

P: Yeah, that sounds good. 

D: OK, sounds great. Well, we'll see you soon then.

P: Alright, thank you.

D: Take care.

No. Are you on any medications? I just take some Tylenol sometimes for the like Tylenol cold sometimes for the symptoms. I don't think it has really helped. No. Okay. Do you have any allergies? Not just medications, but anything else? Just like hay fever, but nothing else that I can think of, no. Okay. Are you up to date with all your immunizations? As far as I know, yeah, everything's up to date. Okay. Any family history of lung conditions? Don't think so. My sister, I think they were saying she might have asthma and she also has eczema. Okay. But no one else in the family has any other conditions. Or not even like heart conditions, cancers? No. No, not that I know of. Okay, okay. Have you been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently? No. No, okay. And any travel recently? No, I've been here in Ontario. Okay. And where do you live? So I currently live in London, but I just recently moved into a new flat around two months ago. Two months ago? Okay. Is it more, is it an older flat? No, it's fairly new, but one thing I did notice, I don't know if this has anything to do with it but my flatmate actually smokes um and sometimes that can really irritate and make me cough more sometimes at night yeah any um any pets uh no I don't have any pets okay and and do you smoke no I don't smoke do you smoke marijuana nope I don't have any pets. Okay. And do you smoke? No, I don't smoke. No, okay. Do you smoke marijuana? Nope, never tried marijuana. Okay. Any recreational drugs? No, I don't smoke marijuana or cigarettes. Okay. How about alcohol? Do you drink alcohol? Just like maybe sometimes at parties, but very rarely. Maybe I would say once a month. Okay. And is there anything that you wanted to discuss today that I missed? No, I think that was all just the shortness of breath was scaring me a little bit. Yeah. Just the coughing. But other than that, I just wanted to know what's going on. Okay. Yeah, and you mentioned you were otherwise healthy, so you don't have any history of asthma or anything like that, right? No, no one's ever told me that. But my sister has asthma, so I was wondering maybe. Have you ever experienced shortness of breath when you were younger with exercise? Not really. Maybe just the normal amount. If I'm running around too much i feel shortness of breath but i think it just got worse over the last few months okay and then have you ever had any imaging done in the past like a chest x-ray or investigations like a pulmonary function test no i don't know having. Okay, all right. Well, those are all the questions I had for you. If you didn't have anything else to add, I guess we will conclude by saying that what you have, we have a differential diagnosis for this. It sounds like what you have is asthma. Since your symptoms started three months ago when you moved into a flat with your friends, and it seems like smoking and cold is triggering that. So we'll work you up with a pulmonary function test to start and we'll see if bronchodilators will help with your symptoms and if it doesn't we'll also rule out other things like pneumonia or like allergic rhinitis. How does that sound? Yeah that that sounds good. Okay, sounds great. Well, we'll see you soon then. All right, thank you. Take care. You too."

P: No, nothing that I can think of.

D: Alright, well that's those are all the questions I had for you. I will now do it physical exam and look at your vitals and listen to your chest. It's likely that what you have right now is COPD exacerbation, maybe just a like an infection that you got, which worsened some of your COPD symptoms. We would also have to rule out covid, so we'll be doing a covid swab and will decide based on the on your labs in your vital signs. It's instead of other things whether you need to stay in the ER and be admitted, or if you are good to go home, I will also talk to my attending and will make those decisions together and come back and talk to you. Does that sound good to you?

RES0188,data/final_audio/RES0188.mp3,"D: What brings you in?

P: Hi, I was just really worried. My son just yesterday night I noticed that he was making these grunting noises and I did notice that he was a bit warm yesterday as well, and today I, he just hasn't been himself, just very, very irritable, crying a lot. Yeah, I just got bit worried.

D: Yeah, for sure. What started first?

P: I would say the there was a little bit of coughing earlier, like yesterday. But then later on during the night, it kind of turned into this grunting noise, and he's kind of like his chest is moving a lot more when he's taking a breath in and all that.

D: OK. Uhm did you measure his temperature at home?

P: Yeah, so I think it was 38.5 degrees Celsius.

D: OK, and did you do that orally or rectal or under armpit?

P: I did it under the armpit. 

D: OK. OK, uhm so you mentioned that he's had a fever, he's been grunting and he just seems a little bit more fussy. Is that right?

P: Yeah.

D: OK is he coughing at all?

P: He was yesterday but not really now. 

D: OK and was it a dry cough? 

P: I think so. I mean, not-nothing really came out.

D: OK, that's good. So no blood, no sputum?

P: No. 

D: OK, and did he seem wheezy?

P: Uh, no. 

D: No, OK. So there's no wheezing with the grunting?

P: Maybe a little bit like that, just a little bit of a noise, but it's mostly the grunting. 

D: OK. Has he had any weight loss?

P: No, not that I really, we haven't really weighed him now since his last appointment. 

D: OK. Does he seem excessively tired or fatigued?

P: Uhm, moreso today I would say he's like earlier, he was very fussy, but now he seems a bit more tired.

D: OK. Any rashes that you've noticed?

P: No.

D: No, OK. Uhm any changes in his vision or hearing?

P: Uh, no, not that I can tell.

D: No, OK. So he's responding to like sounds and he's still looking at you and things like that?

P: Yeah.

D: OK. Have you noticed a runny nose or stuffy nose?

P: Uhm, no, nothing like that.

D: No, OK. And he said he hasn't had any like fainting spells?

P: Uh, no, I don't think so.

D: No, OK. And how many wet diapers is he producing in a day now? 

P: Probably 5 or 6.

D: 5 or 6 OK. Has that changed from before?

P: No, it's pretty much the same.

D: OK, and uhm any changes to his bowel movements?

P: No.

D: No. How about his urine?

P: No.

D: No, OK. OK. And then you said he was fussy, is he still eating and drinking OK?

P: Uh no, today he's not really taking anything in, like very fussy, very hard to feed him today.

D: OK, is he crying a lot?

P: Earlier today was crying a lot, but now has calm down and just I guess tired himself out.

D: Yeah, OK. Alright, and is he an otherwise healthy child?

P: Yeah he was, he was premature by three weeks so, Other than that like I remember when he was born they did have earlier some issues with his oxygen not being high enough and they had to like keeping, keep us in the hospital for a bit longer.

D: OK.

P: But yeah, after that, like there haven't really been too many concerns.

D: OK, so he's hitting all the developmental milestones like in terms of motor movements, ah speech, behaviour, all of that?

P: Yeah, no issues there so far.

D: OK, and how about medications? Is he on any?

P: No.

D: No medications, OK. And is up to date with all his immunizations?

P: Yeah, oh he had all his immunizations so far. 

D: OK. How about allergies? Does he have any?

P: Not that I know of. 

D: No, OK. Any family history of lung or heart conditions?

P: No.

D: OK, and does anyone at home smoke?

P: No, no one smokes. 

D: OK. Has he been in contact with anyone sick recently?

P: Uh, no, not that I know of. Uhm his older sister does go to school though, but I don't know if she might have carried something home.

D: OK, how old is she? 

P: She's six years old.

D: Six, OK. And is she healthy or is she having similar symptoms?

P: No, she's healthy. No, no symptoms.

D: OK. Any travel recently? 

P: No. 

D: No, OK. And who does he live with at home?

P: Uh, so his older sister, me and his mother.

D: OK, any reasons to believe like you have old carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, pets, anything like that that could worsen his symptoms?

P: Uh, no nothing like that.

D: OK, so I think those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or any concerns? Anything that I missed that you wanted to add?

P: No, I think that was all.

D: OK, uhm so for him we'll do a Covid swab just to rule that out because some of his symptoms do overlap with that. But it it's really sounding like a picture of like community acquired pneumonia, so we'll do a couple of things for him. Uhm, we can get his temperature, get his oxygen oxygen saturation right away we'll get a chest x-ray. We'll do some blood work as well and uhm, he might need to be admitted depending on uhm, the oxygen, oxygen saturation and the fact that he's grunting. So if he's admitted will give him some extra oxygen and keep monitoring him and keep him hydrated. Uhm we'll also give him some antibiotics if, if it turns out he has pneumonia. Yeah, does that sound OK?

P: That sounds good. Thank you.

So he's responding to, like, sounds and he's still looking at you and things like that? Yep. Okay. Have you noticed a runny nose or stuffy nose? No, nothing like that. No, okay. And he hasn't had any, no, nothing like that. No, okay. And he hasn't had any, like, fainting spells? Um, no, I don't think so. No, okay. And how many wet diapers is he producing in a day now? Um, probably five or six. Five to six, okay. Has that changed from before no it's pretty much the same okay and any changes to his bowel movements no no how about his urine? No. No? Okay. Okay. And you said he was fussy. Is he still eating and drinking okay? No, today he's not really taking anything in, like very fussy, very hard to feed him today. Is he crying a lot? Earlier today he was crying a lot, but now he's calmed down and just, I guess, tired himself out. Yeah, okay. All right, and is he an otherwise healthy child? Yeah, he was premature by three weeks. So other than that, I remember when he was born, they did have earlier some issues with his oxygen not being high enough and they had to like keeping keep us in the hospital for a bit longer but yeah after that like there haven't really been too many concerns okay so he's hitting all the developmental milestones like in in terms of motor movements, speech, behavior, all of that? Yeah, no issues there so far. Okay. And how about medications? Is he on any? No. No medications, okay. And is he up to date with all his immunizations? Yeah, he had all his immunizations so far. Okay. How about allergies? Does he have any? Not that I know of. No, okay. Any family history of lung or heart conditions? No. Okay. And family history of lung or heart conditions? No. Okay. And does anyone at home smoke? No, no one smokes. Okay. Okay. Has he been in contact with anyone sick recently? No, not that I know of. His older sister does go to school, though. I don't know if she might have carried something home. Okay, how old is she? She's six years old. Six, okay. And is she healthy, or is she having similar symptoms? No, she's healthy. No symptoms. Okay. Any travel recently? No. No, okay. And who does he live with at home? So his older sister, me, and his mother. Okay. Any reasons to believe, like you have old carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, pets, anything like that that could worsen his symptoms? No, nothing like that. Okay. So I think those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or any concerns, anything that I missed that you wanted to add? No, I think that was all. Okay. And so for him um we'll do a covid swab just to rule that out um because some of his symptoms do overlap with that but it it's really sounding like a picture of like a community acquired pneumonia so um we'll do a couple of things for him. Um, we can get his temperature, get his oxygen saturation, um, right away. We'll get a chest x-ray. Um, we'll do some blood work as well and um he might need to be admitted depending on the oxygen saturation and the fact that he's grunting. So if he's admitted, we'll give him some extra oxygen and keep monitoring him and keep him hydrated. We'll also give him some antibiotics if it turns out he has pneumonia. Yeah, does that sound okay? That sounds good, thank you. Okay, yeah, no worries."

No, I was just worried that I could have COVID. Yeah, for sure. So that's kind of top on my list right now to rule out. So we will do a COVID swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results. In the meantime, you should isolate for about 14 days. And if your symptoms get worse, go to the ER. Or if you're experiencing things like weakness, seizures, and you're not getting any better in a couple of weeks or you feel dehydrated. Otherwise, supportive care at home, keeping yourself hydrated, eating well, sleeping well, all of those will definitely help as well. Does that sound okay? Yeah, it does. Thank you. Okay. Yeah, no problem."

MSK0039,data/final_audio/MSK0039.mp3,"D: What brings you in?

P: Uh I just came in today I think I broke my leg or something, it's something that was, I heard a snap, I was in um just a dance class um and we have like these long uh dresses, it it was a traditional dance class and my foot uh slipped right onto, it got caught in my dress and it just kind of slipped and I I felt right on my, my leg kind of twisted and I fell down and I just stayed down. I knew something was not right and something was broken.

D: When did this happen?

P: Just uh I would say like an hour ago 

D: Hour ago, OK. Are you able to bear any weight on it at all?

P: No, not really. I I had to come in the ambulance.

D: OK, OK, and um if you were to localize this pain, where exactly is it?

P: It's pretty much my whole lower leg is painful, but I think where it looks like it broke is like the middle part of my lower leg.

D: The middle part, OK middle part of your lower leg, so kind of where your shins are?

P: Mhmm.  

D: OK, so in the shin area, OK. Um have you tried anything for it? I know it's only been an hour.

P: Uh no nothing. I just like I just want to make sure I keep it as still as possible um I didn't wanna even try anything.

D: OK yeah, that makes sense, if you were to describe this pain, would you say it's um sharp, dull, achy throbbing?

P: It's like sharp and throbbing. It's like probably one of the worst pains that I've felt in my life.

D: OK, OK. And 1 to 10, 10 being the worst pain ever, how bad is it?

P: At 10 for sure.

D: Ten, OK, have you, so you said you've never experienced this before, um do you feel like it's getting worse, the pain, or has it been pretty much the same since it started, or is it getting better?

P: Uh I would say it's the same, it's like I'm in as much pain as I was earlier.

D: OK. OK and um so yeah, OK, um do you know how you felt like on the floor? Like did you uh go like leg first or was it, did your um, kind of like the mechanism of your fall, did you break the fall at all with your arms?

P: Uh no, I didn't break, it kind of, so I was kind of uh, I feel like when I was slipping it was at first my leg was hyper extended but it kind of just felt like it snapped and it went straight down, so there was some kind of twisting as well as some hyperextension. Um but it just kind of slipping on my dress and then just straight down.

D: OK, OK. Um otherwise, do you have any pain elsewhere in your body?

P: No.

D: How about any numbness or tingling in the area?

P: Um I do feel some numbness, tingling just below where it happened, um but it like comes and goes.

D: OK um and then how about how about any um like feelings of like losing sensation or feeling cold in that area? 

P: Um no, I I can feel everything in that area.

D: OK.

P: But it's hard to tell like it's just very painful right now.

D: OK, yeah, that's understandable. Um how about headaches? 

P: No, no headaches.

D: Uh any fainting or dizziness.

P: No. 

D: Um confusion or memory loss?

P: No. 

D: Um weight loss recently.

P: No.

D: Fevers or chills?

P: No.

D: Uh changes to your hair, nails, or skin, like rashes?

P: No, nothing that I've noticed.

D: No, any changes to your vision, hearing, smell, or taste?

P: No.

D: Um how about coughing, shortness of breath, or wheezing?

P: No, no, nothing like that. 

D: No, OK, um how about chest pain or palpitations?

P: No. 

D: No, any changes to your bowel movements?

P: Uh no, not that I've noticed.

D: Uh nausea or vomiting?

P: Nope.

D: Abdominal pain?

P: No.

D: Changes to urinary habits?

P: No, nothing like that.

D: No, OK, um and are you otherwise healthy?

P: Yeah, I've been pretty healthy, I um don't take any medications regularly, I don't have any medical conditions.

D: OK, that's good. Any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?

P: No, um just just for like my pregnancies, I had two pregnancies, both of them delivered vaginally, but no issues with that, just after that no hospitalizations or surgeries.

D: OK, OK. Um and then um are you up to date with all your immunizations?

P: Yep.

D: OK, that's good. Um do you have any allergies?

P: No, not that I know of. 

D: OK, um and then is there any family history of like musculoskeletal issues?

P: Um so my mother has something called osteoporosis. 

D: OK, yep.

P: Um but that's that's all that I can think of.

D: How old was she when she was diagnosed with that?

P: Um probably in her fifties.

D: In her fifties, OK. 

P: Late fifties I would say.

D: Um have you been, have you ever like been tested for that?

P: No, I've never, I've never had testing.

D: OK, all right. Um and then any family history of lung or heart conditions?

P: No.

D: Uh how about autoimmune conditions?

P: Uh no, not that I know of.

D: Any cancers?

P: Uh, I think one of my aunts has uh ovarian cancer. 

D: OK, OK, um how old was she when she was diagnosed with that?

P: Um like pretty uh recently, so probably like in her sixties.

D: OK, OK, um and then have you been in touch with anyone sick recently?

P: No. 

D: No, OK, have you done any travel recently?

P: No. 

D: OK. Um those are all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own or anything you wanted to add before we move to the physical exam component?

P: No, I just want to get this fixed as soon as possible.

D: OK, that sounds good, yeah we'll, we'll try our best.

P: Thank you.

D: Um OK, so now looking at your legs like side by side, do you notice any uh redness or swelling in your right leg compared to your left?

P: Yeah, it's all, it's all swollen and red and just looks so much different than my other leg.

D: OK, yeah, um do you notice any obvious like breaks in the skin?

P: No, there's no breaks in the skin but like when I fell like I, I can definitely see like the bend, there is like a bend in the bone, so I definitely do think it's broken.

D: OK, and do you notice any like bony pieces that are pushing on the skin?

P: No.

D: No, OK. Uh any bruises in the area?

P: Yeah, the whole area seems bruised up and angry.

D: OK. Um does uh, besides the bruising and the misalignment, do you notice any other obvious deformities, any muscle atrophy in the area?

P: No.

D: No, OK, and then uh placing your hand on one leg compared to the other, does it seem warmer?

P: Yeah, I feel like it's it's warmer.

D: OK um and then I'm gonna try to get you to do some movements, um can you move your right leg at all, like can you flex and extend your knees?

P: No, not not at all like I I'm I'm too scared to try.

D: OK, and how about weight bearing, are you able to stand up at all on that leg?

P: No, I just I just got time to call the ambulance, I knew I knew it was just not possible.

D: OK, alright, um I guess those were all the questions that I had for you. Um I think you may have a tibial fracture. So we'll start with some X Rays um to be sure and to try to take a look at like where the fracture is and how we can approach that. Um because everything is swollen and angry down there, we'll probably try and um apply a splint um until the swelling goes down. And then um we can uh refer you to an orthopaedic surgeon for a surgic, for the surgery itself. So that could um involve, like uh  you know them doing like and intramedullary nail, plates and screws, and um like some sort of fixation. Um but after the surgery, your fracture will probably take about four to six months to heal completely, uh so in that period um we can talk about like pain management and physiotherapy as well, just to keep the muscles in that area strong and to increase your range of motion. Does that sound OK?

P: That sounds good. Alright, thank you so much.

D: OK, yeah, no worries.",708.279875,us_medical,"What brings you in? I just came in today. I think I broke my leg or something. It's something that I heard a snap. I was in just a dance class. And we have like these long dresses. It was a traditional dance class. And my foot slipped right onto it got caught in my dress and it just kind of slipped. And I I fell right on my leg kind of twisted and I fell down and I just stayed down. I knew something was not right and something was broken. When did this happen? Just a, I would say like an hour ago. Hour ago, okay. Are you able to bear any weight on it at all? No, not really. I had to come in the ambulance. Okay, okay. And if you were to localize this pain where exactly is it? It's pretty much my whole lower leg is painful but I think where it looks like it broke is like the middle part of my lower leg. The middle part, okay. Middle part of your lower leg so kind of where your shins are. Right, yeah. Okay, so in the shin area. Okay. Have you tried anything for it? I know it's only been an hour. No, nothing. I just wanted to make sure I keep it as still as possible. I didn't want to even try anything. Okay, yeah, that makes sense. If you were to describe this pain, would you say it's sharp, dull, achy, throbbing? It's like sharp and throbbing. It's like probably one of the worst pains that I've ever had. felt in my life. Okay, okay. And 1 to 10, 10 being the worst pain ever, how bad is it? 10, for sure. 10, okay. Have you, so you said you've never experienced this before, do you feel like it's getting worse, the pain, or has it been pretty much the same since it started, or is it getting better? I would say it's the same. It's like, I'm in as much pain as I was earlier. Okay. Okay, and um, so yeah, okay. Um, do you know how you felt like on the floor? Like, did you go like leg first or was it, was your um, kind of like the mechanism of your fall, did you break the fall at all with your arms? No, I didn't break it kind of So I was kind of a, I feel like when I was slipping, it was at first my leg was hyperextended, but it kind of just felt like it snapped and it went straight down. So there was some kind of twisting as well as some hyperextension, but it just kind of slipping on my dress and then just straight down. Okay, okay. Otherwise, do you have any pain elsewhere on your body? No. How about any numbness or tingling in the area? I do feel some numbness tingling just below where it happened, but it comes and goes. Okay. And then how about any feelings of losing sensation or feeling cold in that area? No, I can feel everything in that area. It's hard to tell, it's just very painful right now. How about headaches? No, no headaches. Any fainting or dizziness? No. Confusion or memory loss? Weight loss? No. Weight loss recently? No. Fevers or chills? No. Changes to your hair, nails, or skin, like rashes? No, nothing that I've noticed. No. Any changes to your vision, hearing, smell, or taste? No. Have you had a cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing? No, nothing like that. No, okay. How about chest pain or palpitations? No. No, any changes to your bowel movements? No, not that I've noticed. Nausea or vomiting? No. Abdominal pain? No. Changes to your urinary habits? No, nothing like that. No, okay. And are you otherwise healthy? Yeah, I've been pretty healthy. I don't take any medications regularly. I don't have any medical conditions. Okay, that's good. Any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past? No, just for like my pregnancies. I had two pregnancies, both of them delivered vaginally. But no issues with that, just after that no hospitalizations or surgeries. Okay, okay. And then are you up to date with all your immunizations? Yep. Okay, that's good. Do you have any allergies? No, not that I know of. Okay. And then is there a family history of like musculoskeletal issues? So my mother has something called osteoporosis. Okay, yeah. But that's all that I can think of. How old was she when she was diagnosed with that? Probably in her 50s. 50s, I would say. Have you ever, like, been tested for that? No, I've never, I've never had to Okay, all right. And then any family history of lung or heart conditions? No. How about autoimmune conditions? No, not that I know of. Any cancers? I think one of my aunts has ovarian cancer. Okay, okay. How old was she when she was diagnosed with that? Pretty recently, probably in her 60s. Okay. And then have you been in touch with anyone sick recently? No. No, okay. Have you done any travel recently? No. Okay. Those were all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own or anything you wanted to add before we move to the physical exam component? No, I just want to get this fixed as soon as possible. Okay, that sounds good. Yeah, we'll try our best. Thank you. Okay, so now looking at your legs, like side by side, do you notice any redness or swelling? swelling in your right leg compared to your left? Yeah, it's all swollen and red. It just looks so much different than my other leg. Okay, yeah. Do you notice any obvious like breaks in the skin? No, there's no breaks in the skin, but like when I fell, I can definitely see like the bend. There was like a bend in the bone, so I definitely do think it's broken. Okay, and do you notice any like bony pieces that are pushing on the skin? No. No? Okay. Any bruises in the area? Yeah, the whole area seems bruised up and angry. Does besides the bruising and the misalignment do you notice any other obvious deformities, any muscle atrophy in the area? No. No, okay. And then placing your hand one leg compared to the other does it seem warmer? Yeah I feel like it's warmer. Okay. And then I'm gonna try to get you to do some movements. Can you move your right leg at all? Like can you flex and extend your knees? No, not at all. I'm too scared to try. Okay. And have a weight bearing, are you able to stand up at all on that leg? No, I just got them to call the ambulance. I knew it was just not possible. Okay, all right. I guess those were all the questions that I had for you. I think you may have a tibial fracture, so we'll start with some x-rays to be sure and to to take a look at like where the fracture is and how we can approach that. Because everything is swollen and angry down there, we'll probably try and apply a splint until the swelling goes down and then we can I refer you to an orthopedic surgeon for the surgery itself. So that could involve like, you know, them doing like an intramedullary nail, plates and screws and like some sort of fixation. But after the surgery, your fracture will probably take about four to six months to heal completely. So in that period, we can talk about pain management and physiotherapy as well, just to keep the muscles in that area strong and to increase your range of motion. Does that sound okay? That sounds good. Thank you so much. Okay, yeah, no worries."," what brings you in?

D: Yeah, no, that's a, that's a fair point. And yeah, there's multiple things that you can try over the counter, but we can get into that more later. Are you having any other symptoms at all, like any, shortness of breath, chest pain, any kind of dizziness, anything like that?

P: No dizziness, I feel like sometimes I have a headache though, because I feel like there's a lot of fluid or something backed up into my sinuses.

P: Mhm, a little bit, yeah.

D: OK. Have you at all in the past couple weeks to a month had contact with anyone that was sick?

P: Uh, no, what can I do about this runny nose?

D: Yeah, so it seems like it's been going on for more than one and a half week. What, what is reassuring is that you're not having any other symptoms that are concerning, like you're not having any cough, you're not having any green or yellow sputum, you're not having any fevers, so it seems that you might just be having a cold, which can be caused by just a viral, uh, infection, but it should go away on its own. Just make sure that you're getting some rest, you're hydrating well, uhm, you can get some over the counter medications like Tylenol cold for example, but for now I would say we should just wait and watch. But just in case, also, since it is one of the symptoms that's for covid as well, in this time period we will just get a covid swab just in case, but most likely it's nothing to be worried about. Until you get your test, I would recommend staying isolated. And then we can go on from there, is that, does that sound good to you?

P: Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you so much.

RES0016,data/final_audio/RES0016.mp3,"D: How are you doing?

P: Not so well I I feel like I've been having just worsening breathlessness and a cough for it's been going on for two years now and I just can't seem to get rid of it. 

D: OK, the cough and breathlessness both started two years ago?

P: Yeah, I would say approximately around the same time. 

D: OK, OK. Um, do you always have the breathlessness, or does it come and go?

P: Um, I think it's, I feel short of breath most of the times, but it's mainly just gets worse when I'm exerting myself when I'm walking more than usual or just working in the garden.

D: OK, OK, um and same thing with the cough? It gets worse when you're walking around?

P: Yeah, I would say so.

D: OK. And was there any sort of trigger for this two years ago? Anything that you remember?

P: Um, no, it kind of just started gradually on its own. No, no real triggers that I can remember. 

D: OK, and, does anything make it worse or better besides the exertion?

P: Uh, no, I think that's pretty much the only thing that really makes it worse. 

D: OK, and how would you describe your breathlessness? Is it that you're breathing too fast or you can't catch your breath?

P: It's I think it's more so just I can't catch my breath and sometimes I just have trouble being able to take like a full breath. 

D: OK, OK. Um, and out of 1 to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is your breathlessness?

P: It can get up to I would say like an eight sometimes when I'm doing a lot of work. 

D: OK, and have you ever experienced this before?

P: Not before the two years, before I I never felt anything like that. 

D: OK, and you mentioned it's gradually been getting worse, right?

P: Yeah, I was just wondering, I don't know the results of the contact that I had, uh, so should I also get tested today?

D: Yeah, certainly with nonspecific symptoms such as what you've been experiencing, we will do a test for covid today. However, we will do some lab investigations as well, because it could be something else, so we'll wait for some of those results to come back, and it's great that you've already taken the initiative to isolate from family members and whatnot.

Okay, have you had any other surgeries besides the appendix removed? No, that's the only surgery. Okay, and any allergies to medications? No, not that I know of. Okay. And can you tell me a little bit about your living situation? Yeah, so I currently live with my wife and son. I'm kind of distant, so we live in a house just in London and like I made sure to just isolate myself to one room and I wear a mask around them. Just in case. Okay, well that's good. Yeah, it's important to be socially distancing, especially when having symptoms. Has anybody else in that house been sick? No, no one has been sick recently, at least in my house, but I do, like, just two weeks ago I did attend a family event and just last week I found out someone was having symptoms and they just got tested just two days ago and their test result hasn't come back okay I see and have you traveled at anywhere kind of like outside of the province or outside of the country? No, it was just here in London, so just nothing other than that. I haven't left the province. Okay. And what was the approximate number of people? It was just five, five people, so we stayed within the limits stated for the city and they were people in like my circle as well. So yeah, I don't think I was doing anything wrong.

However, we'll do some lab investigations as well because it could be something else. So we'll wait for some of those results to come back and it's great that you already taken the initiative to isolate from family members and whatnot and so I'll ask you to continue doing so and we will get back to you when the results are in.

RES0073,data/final_audio/RES0073.mp3,"D: Would you mind by starting with what brought you in?

P: Yeah, so over the last week I've just been feeling some symptoms. It kind of first started with, like a runny nose. That was around like 5 days ago and then it turned into just a lot of congestion, like around my nose and like my throat. And now over the last two days I've been just feeling so much pressure around my nose and around my jaw so I've been getting a lot of pain there as well.

D: OK, is your nose still running?

P: Yeah, I'm still getting some discharge and I also feel like I'm getting some dripping at the back of my throat too, especially when I wake up.

D: OK, and could you describe the discharge? Is it clear, yellow, greenish?

P: Uh, it's fairly clear and sometimes, like a bit white, but like, it's not like green or yellow.

D: OK, uh, and have you felt that it's difficult to breathe in through either of your nostrils, like it's obstructed?

P: Yeah, so at night sometimes I have to like turn because one side of my nose gets difficult to breathe from and then it kind of balances out on the other side. So yeah, I do have some obstruction.

D: OK, have you had any fevers or chills?

P: Uhm, it's been mainly OK, just maybe sometimes difficult to get to sleep with all the all the congestion, but I don't think my energy has been affected too much, no.

D: OK, and, uh, sorry to go back to this, I don't think I asked. Did you notice any discharge from your eyes or any eye redness?

P: Not discharge, but yeah, maybe a little bit of redness.

D: OK, have your eyes been itchy?

P: Uhm Yeah, a little bit. I would say they have been a bit itchy.

P: No, other than that I take multivitamins.

D: OK, and do you have any allergies to medications or like environmental allergies that might be getting worse?

P: Uh, no, not that I know.

D: OK, so you don't experience any symptoms like this when the seasons change?

P: I don't think so. I have had this happen to me, Uh, I would say like once before. It happened like two years ago. It was pretty similar. 

D: OK, uhm, and what was done at that time?

P: At that time it kind of just went away on it's own. It got better. I feel it's definitely worse this time. But at that time I didn't even go to the doctor, it kind of just went away.

D: OK, I see. Any recent hospitalizations?

P: No hospitalizations.

D: Any surgeries?

P: Nope. 

D: Alright, and could you tell me where abouts you're living currently and who you're living with?

P: Yeah, so I'm currently living in an apartment by myself, just outside of London.

D: OK, and anybody that you've been around who's had any symptoms?

P: Uh, no, not that I know of.

D: OK, so no sick Contacts. And have you traveled anywhere out of the city or province?

P: No, I've tried to stay home, besides going to work. I just work at the grocery store. Besides that, no, nowhere else.

D: OK, and any of your coworkers have any symptoms? Or any coworkers being off sick?

P: No, we're pretty careful right now with the pandemic.

D: I see, yeah, that's great. OK, and do you smoke cigarettes?

P: No, I quit just a couple of years ago.

D: Oh, that's great. It's not easy to quit, so that's awesome. And do you drink alcohol?

P: Just maybe like red wine a couple of times a week.

D: I see, OK, and do you use any recreational drugs?

D: OK, uh, and anybody in the family have any lung or heart conditions?

P: Uh, no, no cancers.

P: No,  I think that's all. I just didn't know if I needed any, like, medications or if I needed to get tested. I just wanted to make sure.

D: Yeah, so well, certainly check your temperature to see if you have a fever. And if you do and it's high enough, that will increase the chance that you have a bacterial sinusitis,  and if so, with some of your symptoms, including the discharge, obstruction, loss of smell, and facial pain, that all fits the picture for it and also you had a period where you felt a little bit better and then worse again. So that might require antibiotics, but we will check your temperature and go from there.

P: No, like I I sometimes like I used this saline rinse.

D: OK.

P: No, no, it's a pretty new house.

D: OK, alright, any pets at home?

P: We have a dog. It's a labradoodle. 

D: OK, yeah.

P: And that's it, yeah.

D: How long have you had him? 

P: Oh, like, he's like 3 now. Like my sinus infections and that have been going on for longer than we've had him.

D: OK, alright. Those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for me? 

P: I don't think so. I just I hope you know, we can do something about this. Because you know, I tried all this stuff that is supposed to be like, you know, conservative like the first steps and it just doesn't seem like it's getting better. It's been like few weeks. So, I thought it was probably time to come see you. 

D: Yeah, sorry. What have you tried at home again?

P: So I use the, the rinses the saline rinses. I used a little bit of nasal decongestant but I know like I know I've been told I'm not supposed to do that for more than a few days, so I don't. Yeah, that's, I think that's pretty well it 'cause they said there's not much we can really do.

D: OK, yeah. So your symptoms, OK because some some of these things overlap with Covid, we're going to have to swab you and they'll notify you of your results in like 24 to 48 hours. But what it sounds like is something called Sinu, Sinusitis and it sounds like acute bacterial rhinosinusitis because of some f the symptoms that you have, and it's been going on for more than a week and it's, it's not going away with the rinse, saline rinses and these decongestants. So we will prescribe some antibiotics for you. Probably amoxicillin. Take those for five to seven days and see if some of your symptoms clear up. If they continue to be severe, umm, actually, at this will also prescribe you some inhaled corticosteroids because I think those can help as well, so will give you both of those for now and then just follow up with us in a week after you've tried both things and we'll see how your symptoms are holding up at that point. Does that sound like a good plan to you?

P: Yeah, I think that sounds that sounds fair. Yeah, thank you.

How about, um, how about like Disney are fainting? No. No. Okay. Are you otherwise healthy or do you have any long-standing medical conditions? No, this is pretty well the only thing. I've had some problems with my knee, like I had some problems with the ACL, so I see an orthopedic person for that, but otherwise I'm healthy. Okay. Okay. And are you on any medications? No. Like I sometimes, like I use the saline rinse for this. I used to use the nasal steroid spray and I hadn't had an infection for a while and things were feeling okay, so I haven't been using it recently. And then I occasionally will use like an Advil if my knees sore. Okay. Okay. And no hospitalizations or surgeries? So I had an ACL repair surgery. All right, yeah, okay. And like I went to the emergency department once when I had a bad sinus infection, but I didn't like stay over at the hospital. Okay, okay. How about immunizations? Are you up to date? Yeah, I think so. I never didn't get any. Okay. Any allergies? Like a little bit to cats, but nothing else. Okay. Any family history of lung or heart conditions? No, not that I know of. Okay. How about smoking? Do you smoke? No. Do you drink alcohol? I drink a few beers on the weekend. Okay. Five or six per weekend? Okay. And any recreational drugs? I will occasionally take a cannabis, like a capsule, like the oil in the capsule. Okay, and what is that for? Just like recreational. Also, like, I mean, my knee, my knee pain, sometimes it helps. Mm-hmm. Okay. But, like, essentially, that might be like once, like per month or something. Okay. Okay. All right. And do any sick contacts recently? No, no, I've been working from home. Okay. Okay. Any travel recently? No, no. Okay. And where do you live? I live here in town with my wife and our Teenage son. Okay. Is anyone at home sick? No, they're fine. They're fine? Okay. And what about, sorry? They're both working from home, like doing school from home too, so we really don't go anywhere. Like my wife goes to get groceries and that's about it. Okay, I see. And any old carpets, smoke, asbestos, mold, anything like that at home? No, no, it's a pretty new house. Okay, all right. Any pets at home? We have a dog. It's a Labradoodle. Okay. And that's it, yeah. How long have you had him? Oh, like, uh, he's like three now. Like my, my sinus infections and that have been going on for longer than we've had him. Okay, all right. Those are all the questions that I have for you. Did you have any questions of your own for me? I don't think so. I just, I hope, you know, we can do something about this because, you know, I tried all this stuff that is supposed to be like, you know, conservative, like the first steps and it just doesn't seem like it's getting better. Now it's been like a few weeks. So I thought it was probably time to come see you. Yeah, sorry, what have you tried at home again? So I used the rinses, the saline rinses. I used a little bit of nasal decongestion, but I know, like, I know I've been told I'm not supposed to do that for more than a few days, so I don't. Yeah, that's pretty well it, because I said there's not much we can really do. Okay, yeah. So your symptoms, okay, because some of these things overlap with COVID, we're going to have to swab you and they'll notify you of your results in like 24 to 48 hours. But what it sounds like is something called sinusitis, and it sounds like acute bacterial rhinosinusitis because of some of the symptoms that you have, and it's been going on for more than a week. And it's It's not going away with saline rinses and these decongestants. So we will prescribe some antibiotics for you, probably amoxicillin. Take those for five to seven days and see if some of your symptoms clear up. If they continue to be severe, we'll also prescribe you some inhaled corticosteroids. because I think those can help as well. So we'll give you both of those for now. And then just follow up with us in a week after you've tried both things. And we'll see how your symptoms are holding up at that point. Does that sound like a good plan to you?

RES0009,data/final_audio/RES0009.mp3,"D: To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brought you in today?

P: Really I just don't I I don't feel quite right like I've had this pain in my chest for five days now and I've been just feeling kind of out of breath.

D: Oh OK, um where are you feeling this pain?

P: Um, it's it's kind of um. On the left side of my chest and it's just like a tiny. It's like a lingering sharp pain. I don't really feel it anywhere else. It's just kind of there all the time right now. I I've never had anything like this before.

D: OK, so you're not feeling the pain radiate any to any other locations. You're just feeling it sort of in the one spot on the left side?

P: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

D: OK, and since this pain started 5 days ago, has it gotten any better, any worse, or stayed the same?

P: Like when I when it started I was just I was just like sitting on my couch. Um and now it's harder if I'm, it's worse if I'm walking around, like if I walk just down the street to get the mail. But otherwise it's kind of kind of just there, like I took some Tylenol and Advil, and they maybe take the edge off a little bit, but it's always there. And it's worse when I, when I take a deep breath then I really feel it.

D: OK, so it's worse. Is the pain worse when you're walking as well? Like out to get the mail?

P: It's I don't the the pain is, but I I'm not I can't catch my breath when I'm doing that.

D: OK, and have you had any urinary problems?

P: No, I mean so I had. I had a I had a hysterectomy. Weeks ago, maybe like maybe like a month ago now, um? So after that it was, you know, feeling a little. Like I was kind of not drinking as much and that so I wasn't peeing as much then, but I think it's normal now.

D: OK um. And how have you recovered since the hysterectomy? Were you like bedbound for quite awhile afterwards or were you up an active?

P: Really, it was not really long that I may be a few days, I wasn't. I wasn't walking as much, but I thought it was like back to my normal self.

P: OK I yeah. Is that scary? Is that bad?

D: It can vary from being mild to severe, and so that's what we want to get. Some of the imaging and lab work to see well to first confirm if that's what you actually have, and if so, offer the right treatment.

Um, I, uh, Thank you. recovered from that surgery quickly and um what was the surgery for um i uh i mean i i'm done having kids and i uh i had i was just having really um heavy periods still so uh and you know a lot of pain there.

Any joint pains or leg pains or muscle pains? No, I don't think so. Okay. So, in regards to past health, any previous medical diagnoses? No, just like I had the hysterectomy, but I don't take any medications. I don't have high blood pressure or anything.

Um, my mom had a heart attack when she was like in her 70s. Other than that, I don't, I don't know. I don't think so. Okay. Any cancers in the family or, or bleeding disorders or coagulation disorders? No, I don't think so. Okay. So I haven't heard of anybody in the family having like a blood clot or a thrombombosis anywhere uh like my mom's like cousin but not no one like not like my parents or anything okay um so the next uh few questions i just wanted to ask about your personal and um kind of lifestyle habits a little bit um but first could you tell me uh about your living situation uh yeah i live um like i said like i'm done having kids but i have two two kids they're teenagers i live um with them and my husband and uh yeah we live not far from here.

And have you been on any long trips recently? No, I haven't. Fair enough. Vacation would be great. Okay. Okay, so that was all the questions that I wanted to ask on history. We're going to run some investigations. I'm concerned that you might have a pulmonary embolism. and so we're going to do some lab work and imaging to investigate that. Okay. Yeah. Is that scary? Is that bad? It can vary from being mild to severe. And so that's what we want to get some of the imaging and lab work to see. Well, to first confirm if that's what you actually have. And if so, offer the right treatment. Okay. Thanks, doctor. You're welcome. We'll get that started."
RES0098,data/final_audio/RES0098.mp3,"D: How may I help you?

P: So, I just came in here because for the last day I've been just getting shortness of breath. I recently, yesterday actually, was just busy at home, cleaning out my basement. And, like that was yesterday afternoon, I did that for a couple hours and then at night I just started to get the shortness of breath. It's continued until today. I'm also getting some wheezing and tightness in my chest as well as some cough. So yeah, that's all just been happening over the last day.

D: OK, and uh, is the shortness of breath here now? is it, is at rest? Or are you having that when you're exerting yourself?

p: More so when I'm like exerting myself, if I'm sitting down it's better, but I still have, I would say, like my breathing is not normal right now, like it's, I still have to take deeper breaths. And I do have that chest tightness when I take those deep breaths.

D: OK, do you have any chest pain?

P: No, it's more so just the tightness. I wouldn't call it pain, but I do still have a little bit of wheezing.

D: OK.

P: So yeah, that's, that's that.

D: And you mentioned a cough as well. With the cough is it, has it been dry, or have you been bringing up sputum?

P: Uhm, it was, it was mainly dry yesterday, like, like the cough has kind of gone away, but yesterday night I was coughing a lot and it was mostly dry.

D: OK, have you brought up any blood?

P: No. 

D: OK, and have you had any infectious symptoms like, eye tearing or red eyes, maybe a runny nose or sore throat?

P: Uhm, not a sore throat, but it does feel like it, it's kind of like just constricted in there like, uhm, I don't know if it's relevant, but I, I do have asthma. Uh, like I was diagnosed ten years ago, but it's been pretty stable, like it's, like just right now. I haven't had shortness of breath for a pretty long time. 

D: OK, uh, and, uh, we'll get back to the past medical history shortly, I just wanted to ask a few more symptoms, but certainly could be relevant today. Uhm, so uhm, so you mentioned that you have had some throat tightness. Have you had any loss of smell or, or loss of taste? 

P: No, nothing like that.

D: OK, and have you had any fevers or chills?

P: No.

D: OK, have you had any nausea or vomiting?

P: No, no nausea or vomitting.

D: How about, any diarrhea or Constipation?

P: No.

D: And have you had any urinary problems like painful or frequency?

P: No.

D: OK and have you had any night sweats over the last several weeks to months?

P: No, nothing like that.

D: And, uhm, have you had any weight changes over the last little while?

P: No.

D: OK. And have you noticed any skin changes or rashes?

P: Uh, no, I, I do have just like the general, like, eczema, that I use a cream for, but that's just normal for me. 

D: OK. And any muscle aches or, or joint pains?

P: No. 

D: Have you had any fatigue? 

P: No.

D: OK, alright you mentioned asthma as part of your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions?

P: No, it's just asthma and it was diagnosed, I think when I was like, probably 11 or 12 years old.

D: OK, and do you use inhalers for that?

P: Yeah, I have two inhalers, uh, like one, one is like a blue one, one is like an, like an orange one, uh, it's, so I think it's one of them is just like, I take whenever I really need to and the other one I take every day. Uhm, and I haven't been taking the one, uh, I think it's called Ventolin. But I took it like, uh, had to take it like three or four times last night and like, throughout the day yesterday. And it, it did help, but it didn't really relieve some of my symptoms.

D: OK, and prior to that, how often have you been using, uhm, the blue one. 

P: The blue one before yesterday, probably the last time I used it was probably like a month ago. 

D: OK, so you don't need it that that often then?

P: No.

D: Do you have any triggers for asthma that you're aware of, like exercising or going out into the cold or even like allergies like dust or, or, or pollen?

P: Uhm, I do have allergies in the spring. I think it's to pollen and in the winter, it does, like my symptoms do get a bit worse and I have to use the ventil more. But recently for the last few months at least, it's been pretty stable. I haven't really had to use, use it too much.

D: OK, and, and do you use any other medications?

P: Uh, just when I have allergies. I, I just use over the counter allergy meds.

D: OK, and you use a cream for, for your skin too like, yeah?

P: Yeah, I use, like it's, it's, I think it's like a mixture of like a steroid cream. 

D: OK, and do you have any allergies to medications?

P: Not that I know of.

D: OK, and are your immunizations up to date?

P: Yeah.

D: Alright, and right now, who are you living with, and whereabouts are you living?

P: Yeah, so I'm just living with a couple roommates. I just go to college and I'm living with three other roommates.

D: OK, and has anybody been sick?

p: No, everyone's been fine.

D: And have you traveled anywhere?

P: Uhm, I decided, like, I, yesterday I went home like, to my parents house and helped my dad, that's where I was cleaning the basement. But besides that, that was, that was uh, that was it?

D: OK, and  sorry, just had to backtrack a little bit. Have you had any hospitalizations, either due to asthma or for any other reason?

P: Uhm, I think when I was 15, I, I had to go to the emergency department, but I, I wasn't hospitalized.

D: OK, and was this, uh, did you have similar symptoms at that time?

P: Yeah, it was, uh, it was for asthma and like, uh, that time it was definitely much much worse and I remember like I was breathing a lot, uh, the shortness of breath was really bad and the ventolin like puffers weren't even helping me at that time.

D: OK yeah, OK, and have you had any surgeries before?

P: No.

D: Alright, so yeah, you mentioned that you're, you're cleaning up the basement yesterday? Was there a lot of dust down there or anything like that, that might have triggered it?

P: Yeah, we were like just moving boxes. There were books here and there that definitely there would have been dust. I should have been more careful, like wore a mask, but I didn't think about it at that time.

D: OK yeah for sure, uh, and do you smoke cigarettes?

P: No, like I can't even stand cigarette smoke.

D: OK, that's good. And do you smoke marijuana or use any cannabis products?

P: Uh, no if I, if I really want marijuana, I would have to go with edibles, I, I can't take the smoke.

D: OK, I see and, do you drink alcohol?

P: Uh just, I would say probably on the weekends I might have four or five beers.

D: OK, and, anybody else in the family have asthma or skin irritation like, like you have?

P: Yeah so my, my older sister actually also was diagnosed with asthma. She also has the eczema that I have and my mom was also diagnosed with asthma when she was a child, but she's been completely fine since then.

D: OK, well that's good that, that she's been OK. Does anybody in the family have any heart or, or lung conditions or any cancers that run in the family?

P: My grandfather died of lung cancer, but he was just, just smoked all throughout his life. 

D: OK, uhm, alright, so that was all of the questions that I wanted to ask today. So the next part we'll go on to do a physical exam, but did you have any thing else that maybe I forgot to ask about today?

P: Uh, no, I, I, I think I know what this was caused by, but yeah, let's, let's see. Thanks for your help.

D: Oh you're welcome, so yeah, we'll, we'll, uhm,trial some more puffers and see what we could do, cause certainly it's sounding like an asthma exacerbation, and so definitely let somebody know if your, your breathing is getting more difficult.

P: Hi, my son Dave who's 5 years old, who comes to the clinic quite often, has uh, his asthma has been really bad over the past few days. I've tried his puffers, but they're not really helping much, and I'm just worried about him.

D: So what symptom is he experiencing now?

P: Uhm so, he's just having this wheezing that just doesn't go away, like, I can actually hear it, it's frightening, he's having like he's having difficulties falling asleep, he's just been very irritable, uhm, he didn't go to school yesterday. It's just, yeah, it's just, it seems like, it's just, he's not eating well either.

D: OK, so yeah, it's been affecting, uh, sleep, appetite, his mood, has he been short of breath?

P: If he was like, he said that he was having some difficulty breathing, yeah. 

D: OK, has he, uh, able to talk like in full sentences, like, how is he right now?

P: Yeah, he's  able to talk in full sentences but he just gets a little bit breathless when he's eating, which I think is probably why he's not eating much. But yeah, he's able to talk, he's not talking much either, just been like, just been in a mood, you know, he gets a little bit breathless when he's crying.

D: OK, I see, and, has he had a cough?

P: Yeah he does, he does have a cough, yeah.

D: OK, and when did the cough start?

P: I want to say about two days ago.

D: OK, and has he been bringing up any sputum?

P: No.

D: Or any blood?

P: No no no. 

D: OK, and has the cough been getting any better or any worse?

P: It's been the same.

D: OK, uhm, and has he complained of having a sore throat or painful ears?

P: No, he hasn't complained of those. 

D: OK, and have you noticed any eye redness or or any discharge from his eyes or nose?

P: No. 

D: OK, and has he been having any chest pain?

P: Uh, no.

D: OK, and you mentioned, uh, a wheeze, have you been able to hear a wheeze like this before?

P: It's usually not this bad. 

D: OK, has he been having any abdominal pain?

P: No. 

D: Any nausea or vomiting?

P: No.

D: Has he had any urinary problems like, painful when he's going to the bathroom? 

P: No, he hasn't complained of anything like that.

D: I see, OK, and has he had any diarrhea or Constipation?

P: No.

D: OK, has he had any skin changes or rashes?

P: No, no, I checked for those very carefully. He used to get rashes when he was a child, but no, he doesn't, he doesn't have anything right now. 

D: Alright, and has he had any muscle aches or joint pains?

P: Uh, he's just been, he's just been not, he's not been as active as he usually is, so I don't, he hasn't said that any anything in particular about muscle pains, but I don't know if he knows how to, you know? He's just been, yeah.

D: OK, and two days ago, can you think of any triggers like, was there any exposure to dust or smoke or maybe even pets that could have brought this on?

P: Yeah, you know, if I think about it, he did go outside to play with his brother and, I don't know he might have got something out there maybe.

D: Yeah, uh, certainly possible and was it like a particularly cold day? 

P: Yeah, it was a very windy, little bit chilly too.

D: And when, like, during the winter time, does cold air trigger attacks for Dave?

P: Oh yeah. 

D: OK, and how about exercise?

P: No, I don't think, well, they went outside to play, so I mean he was, uhm, exercise does make it worse sometimes, so it could be that too.

D: OK, and so, has dave been experiencing any other symptoms besides the the wheezing and the irritability and what you've described so far?

P: No, I don't think so, that's, I think that's it.

D: OK, you tried some inhalers, how often have you been using them?

P: Yeah, we used his blue inhaler about five times yesterday, and another two or three times earlier today.

D: OK, and do you use a spacer?

P: Uhm, no we don't. I have to go get that and learn how to use it.

D: OK, for sure we can go through, Uh, the proper technique, throughout this visit as well, just to review that again.

P: I would love that.

D: That's great, and has he been using any other medications to help over these last couple of days besides the inhalers?

P: No, just the inhalers, we've also kept it the usual one, the one that he takes, the other inhaler.

D: OK, does he have one that he uses, once, like, he uses daily?

P: Yeah, yeah the one that he uses, I think the orange one.

D: OK, so he does use a steroid inhaler?

P: Yeah.

D: OK, and does he have any allergies?

P: Uhm, no he doesn't.

D: OK, and does he have any medical conditions that have diagnosed previously?

P: Just the dermatitis and asthma?

D: OK, and when was his last asthma exacerbation?

P: Last year. 

D: OK, has he ever needed to be hospitalized for one?

P: Oh no, no, nothing like that, he's a healthy kid. 

D: OK, that's good, has he had any surgeries before?

P: No.

D: OK, and in regards to birth history, were there any complications throughout pregnancy or with delivery?

P: Oh no, everything was normal. He was born via vaginal delivery and no complications. He was a healthy baby.

D: OK, and have you had any concerns with growth or developmental milestones?

P: No, no, the doc was pretty happy when he did the regular, the checkup and yeah things are good with him, he's a good kid.

D: Awesome, OK, and could you tell me a little bit about the living situation, like who's the main caregiver and who he's living with?

P: Yeah, so he lives with me, his dad and his brother who is 2 years older and he's not going to school right now. We're just keeping him at home due to Covid and trying to do some home schooling. I'm a homemaker, so I do have enough time to spend time with him and his older brother and, yeah.

D: OK, has anybody in the home been sick, either his brother, yourself, or father?

P: Uh, no.

D: OK, and anybody, at work or any other places that you maybe traveled to, that, uh, been around anybody who's been sick? 

P: Uhm, no, I don't think so. I don't think there was anyone that was sick.

D: OK, and have you traveled anywhere recently?

P: No, no. We're just staying at home.

D: OK, and are there any pets in the home?

P: No.

D: Alright, any carpets or like, uh, curtains or anything like that, covering the windows? 

P: No, we got all those removed when he had his big exacerbation last year. 

D: I see, OK, and does anybody smoke in the home, either cigarettes or marijuana?

P: Uhm, my husband smokes, but he smokes outside, he never smokes in front of the kids.

D: OK, I see, and uh, does anybody in the family, have any heart or lung conditions?

P: No, uhh, I have some, I have high blood pressure but that's it 

D: OK, any, like, congenital diseases that run in the family? 

P: No.

D: Or how about any genetic diseases?

P: No 

D: Cystic fibrosis or anything like that?

P: No no, no.

D: OK, uhm, so was there any other, anything else that maybe I forgot to ask about or I'm missing that you'd like to add today?

P: No, I'm just worried that he's going to have a big asthma attack like last year, I just also want to make sure nothing else is going on and if he can be taken care of and he's just, he's feeling awful.

D: For sure, yeah, we'll, uh, check his his vital signs and do a physical exam. And it does sound like it could be an asthma exacerbation, and so we can trial some inhaler medications, a little bit different than what you use at home. But also using Ventolin as well and we'll assess the need for potential, uh, antibiotics and also steroid if necessary and if his breathing gets worse or you're starting to hear that the wheezing is getting worse or his work of breathing is becoming more intense then certainly we'll need to add on some oxygen and possibly, some other therapies.

And so where is this pain located exactly? so it's just in the upper right corner of my abdomen, right below where the lungs are. And I have this severe pain that's going on. Okay. And how long has it been going on for? So it's been going on for the last few days and it got worse today. Okay and how long has it been since it like got worse? Has it been a few hours or how long has that been? So I would say it got worse just three or four hours ago before I came to the emergency department. Okay. And does the pain radiate anywhere? No, it stays right in the spot that I told you, right in the right upper corner. Okay. And when did the pain start? Or if you could tell me, what were you doing right prior to the pain starting? So I think it started after just three days ago after I had a meal. Like I think it was after lunch, around half an hour or an hour after lunch. I see. Okay. Has the pain gotten worse, stayed the same or gotten better since yesterday? I think it's gone, it was, it's the worst today, like, especially like a few hours ago, like three hours ago, it was much worse than the other two days. okay and um how would you describe the character or the quality of the pain? So it's like a sharp, I would describe it as like a sharp pain. Okay. And on a scale of one to 10, 10 being the most severe pain, what would you rate it as? I would rate it as, right now, I would rate it as an eight. Okay. And has anything like this happened to you before? I think it happened to me a few years back where I had this pain and then it just kind of went away on its own. I didn't go to the emergency department then though. Okay. And has there been anything that you've tried to make this pain any better? I tried taking just like Advil and Tylenol, but it didn't really seem to help the pain too much. Okay. And have you had any other associated symptoms such as nausea or vomiting? I've had some nausea over the past few days, but I haven't vomited anything. Okay. so no blood in, uh, in your MSS or, um, uh, or, or no vomiting at all? Uh, yeah. Okay. And have you traveled anywhere recently? Uh, no, like we haven't traveled anywhere recently. Okay. And how has your energy levels been? Energy, when it's hurting a lot, like today, it's been difficult to move around. I've been pretty drained from the pain. But otherwise, over the last few days, it hasn't affected me too much. But today, I would say my energy levels are down. Okay. And have you noticed any skin changes or any rashes? I don't think so. I mean, I don't think I've noticed any kind of skin changes. okay and how about any changes to urinary habits like painful urination or the color of your urine? No, no changes. Okay. And have you had any changes to bowel patterns such as diarrhea or changes in color of your stool? no I I don't think so. No changes that I've noticed. Okay. So notice any blood in the stool? No, no blood. Okay. And how has your appetite been? It was around the same before the pain actually started getting worse. So today I didn't really feel like eating. I did have nausea over the past few days, but my appetite, I would say, is the worst today. Okay. And have you noticed any changes to your weight recently? No, I don't think so. Okay. And have you had any recent infections? No, not that I know of, no. Okay. So next, just to ask some questions about your past medical history, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past? So I think the only thing is my doctor told me that I should lose some weight, but other than that, no medical history. Okay. And any allergies to medications? No, no allergies. And are there any medications that you take on a regular basis, either prescribed or over-the-counter? Not prescribed. Sometimes I take, like, some antacids when I get heartburn. But this is just, like, a couple times a month after dinner, sometimes at night. But that's about it. Okay. And any hospitalizations? Just for, just when I had my children at the time of their birth, but that's it. Okay. And have you been around anybody who's been sick? Nope. Okay. And have you had any prior surgeries? Nope. No prior surgeries. Okay. And any family history of gallbladder disease or cardiovascular disease in the family? So my father died of a stroke when he was in his 60s. My mother does have gallstones. Okay. And what do you do for work? So I work at the bank. Okay. I'm a consultant. Okay. And do you drink alcohol? Yeah, sometimes. Okay. Maybe one or two glasses of wine every night. Okay. And do you feel the need to cut down on your drinking? No, not really. Okay. Have you ever felt annoyed by people criticizing your drinking? No. Okay. Have you felt guilty about your drinking? No. Should I be? No. At this time, just wanting to gauge a sense of how you feel about your drinking levels at this time. and a follow-up question to that would be have you ever felt the need to have a drink early in the morning I don't know I'm never doing I don't drink in the morning though okay and do you use recreational drugs I know Okay. And do you smoke cigarettes? Nope. And who are you living with currently at home? So I'm living with my two children and my partner. And can you tell me a little bit about the home situation? Yeah, the home situation is fine. Like kids are doing great and my partner is very supportive. No, no issues that I can think of at home. Okay, excellent. Excellent."

I can, but I can't really bend my thumb and it hurts a lot, so I can bend my fingers, but my thumb's kind of out. okay do do the joints in your thumb hurt at all um no okay um and any pain anywhere else like on your fingers or your elbow no okay um and what movement would you say hurts the most um i probably just moving the the wrist like flexing and extending the wrist okay and the swelling you said is at the base of the thumb right yeah exactly at the base of the thumb on the on the back of the hand there's some yeah bruising and swelling there okay is it warm at all to touch no it doesn't feel warm okay um okay and if you press are you getting any bony pain in that area? Like if you press on a bone? Yeah, like I mean if there's one spot that if I press down, it's like 10 out of 10 pain, it hurts really bad if I press at the base of my thumb there. Okay, alright, so those are all the questions I had for you today. We definitely need to, since you're having pain on just top palpating the area, they're swelling, redness, and you did have a fall and you landed on your, you caught yourself with your hand. There is a common fracture that can happen in those circumstances to your wrist, and so we need to do an x-ray and we will see if you have a fracture or not, but we also need to see if we we need to get a cast for you or if we can manage your injury with a splint and then based on what we see and your physical examination we'll determine how long you need to be in the cast or splint and then we'll go from there. Okay, that sounds good. Thank you."," what brings you in here today yeah yeah last night um so i'm having this pain in my uh right wrist um yeah last night um i i tripped over uh something and i i ended up um like landing on my hand to help break the fall and um this morning i woke up and i have some uh like bruising on my hand uh and it's it's really sore to touch it okay and which right which hand is this uh it's my right hand okay um and when you had your fall, when was your fall? So it was last night, probably like 10 p.m., something like that. I went out with a few friends for dinner and drinks. Okay. And do you remember how high you fell from or what you you fell onto yeah it was standing height we were just kind of walking down the street and um tripped over something on the curb i think there was that yeah maybe like a pothole or something like that and uh so i fell right onto the concrete with my hand oh okay um did you hit your head at all or lose consciousness no nothing like that okay so it was it was mainly your hand that got injured yeah it was just mostly my my hand okay and are you having uh any pain um on movement or if you press on it? Yeah, I do get some pain if I'm trying to move the wrist around and it hurts to press on it as well. Okay. And do you notice any kind of swelling or bruising? I do, yes. There's some swelling and bruising. Okay, and if you had to describe where the swelling and bruising and the pain are uh how would you describe it um so I have a sharp pain um right at my uh wrist I kind of I feel it mostly at the base of my um thumb kind of right at the wrist and that's where the swelling and bruising is as well okay and is it right under your palm or um at the back of your hand on the wrist at the back of the hand at the uh wrist and base of thumb okay okay all right and what kind of pain are you feeling is it sharp is it dull aching oh yeah it's really sharp it feels like somebody's stabbing me in the hand okay and how much would you rate the pain on a scale of zero to ten ten being being the worst pain you've felt in your life? If I'm not moving it around, it's a 3, but if I move it, it goes up to like a 9 out of 10. Okay. And is it radiating or moving anywhere else onto your hand? No, I don't feel it anywhere else. Okay, and do you have any kind of pins and needles sensation, tingling, or numbness anywhere in your hands? No, nothing like that. Okay, anything that makes the pain worse or better? Yeah, I tried some anti-inflammatories that did help with taking the edge off a little bit and um but the pain just came right back and then also uh like just moving it at all hurts even texting um on my phone was really bugging me okay um yeah so you definitely um you went so you had the fall yesterday or um yeah it was yesterday okay okay um all right so when did it start hurting did it start hurting right away or has it gotten worse at all? Yeah, it started hurting right away and it's, well, this morning it's a bit worse, yeah. Okay. Do you have any other symptoms at all, like fever, chills, headache, anything like that? No no any dizziness or fainting no okay um any diarrhea constipation no any changes in your vision hearing balance nope nothing like that okay uh but yeah so your main concern today is this pain in your wrist yeah exactly okay all right and do you have any past uh medical conditions you've been diagnosed with um yeah i do i have uh um asthma and i i use uh an orange inhaler daily um and it's been well controlled i'll use um i haven't used the blue one in a while okay so it's pretty well controlled yeah and uh do you take any other medications at all uh just a um a multivitamin and vitamin D as well. Okay all right and have you been hospitalized in the past or had any surgeries? Yeah I had my tonsils out and my wisdom teeth out when I was a teenager and or tonsils when I was a kid actually especially. And I think that's a great point. I think that's a great point. I think that's a great point. I think that's a great point. I think that's a great point. I think that's a great point. I think that's a great point. I think that's a great point.

Okay, and any complications at all with that at all? No, no, that was okay. Okay, and have you injured your right hand or broken any bones uh before no i haven't okay so this is the first injury on your right hand okay um and do you have any family history of any medical conditions at all yeah Yeah, my uncle died of a heart attack when he was in his 60s. And I think my grandfather also had a heart attack as well. Yeah, that's okay um and in terms of uh your work uh do you do you work currently uh yeah i do i i work um uh in a restaurant and so um this will be uh difficult for my job coming up with an injured wrist and hand. I just restarted and I'll have to be carrying a lot of different things. And so I just hope it's not broken. Oh, I see. Yeah, it might definitely. And that's that might be concerning if, you know, we'll get that checked, though, on x-ray and everything. But we just need to do a few more questions and some examination as well. How would you describe your living situation right now? So I'm living on my own, actually, in an apartment. Okay. And do you currently smoke? No, I've never smoked. I couldn't with having asthma. So, I just stayed away from all of that. Okay, okay, and do you drink alcohol? Uh, yeah, I do. I have a couple of bottles of wine per week. Okay, um, all right, a couple of bottles a week, so how much would you have in an average day oh probably i guess probably like two or three glasses of wine a day okay yeah so we definitely recommend for women um to limit themselves to maybe one to two max two glasses of wine a day as it can have health effects in the future in terms of drinking and then on your liver um okay and other than that uh I just had a few questions. Do you have any recreational drugs like marijuana? No, stayed away from that as well. Okay, okay. So, I'm just going to ask a few questions about specifically to examine your wrist. So, you notice, so can you, are you able to move your wrist around are you able to make a fist I can but it I can't really bend my thumb and it it hurts a lot so I can bend my fingers but my thumbs kind of okay do do the joints Can your thumb hurt at all? No. Okay. And any pain anywhere else, like on your fingers or your elbow? No. Okay. And what movement would you say hurts the most?

At the base of the thumb, on the back of the hand. There's some bruising and swelling there. Okay. Is it warm at all to touch? No, it doesn't feel warm. Okay. Okay. And if you press on, are you getting any bony pain in that area? Like if press on a bone yeah like I mean if I there's one spot that if I press down it it's like 10 out of 10 pain it hurts really bad if I press at the base of my thumb there okay all right so those are all the questions I had for you today. We definitely need to, since you're having pain on just palpating the area, there's swelling, redness, and you did have a fall and you landed on your, you caught yourself with your hand. And there is a common fracture that can happen in those circumstances to your wrist. And so we need to do an x-ray and we will see if you have a fracture or not.
