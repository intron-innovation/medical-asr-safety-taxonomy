D: OK. Alright, and alright could you tell me a little bit about your living situation right now who you're living with and and where?

P: I eat a lot of red meats. But not a lot of um seafood.

D: OK. And. OK, and anybody in the family have a history of musculoskeletal or or neurological conditions?

P: Um so. Who OK, so my my father had like arthritis and I don't remember what kind of arthritis he had but he had severe arthritis. He also had high blood pressure and diabetes, and on my mother's side. Um there is some arthritis there as well and as well as gout and kidney stones.

D: OK.  So that that was everything I wanted to ask all the history. And so, uh, next to ask you to have a look at your feet. And are you seeing any swelling, redness, or discolouration?

P: I see some redness and uh, some swelling in that area.

D: OK, and are you feeling any temperature changes?

P: Yes, and the right one is definitely warmer than the left.

D: OK, then how about any muscle atrophy in the foot or or lower leg or any joint malalignment or deformities?

P: Uh, so in terms of deformity is like it just looks swollen and so there's like a big bump on the right side of my foot, whereas it's completely straight on my left, but other than that, no deformities.

D: OK, and if you were to a palpate or press on areas of your foot or joints of your toes, are you feeling any any pains along the top of your foot or or in any of your other toes?

P: None of my other toes.

D: OK, and how about any pains at the ankle?

P: Um no pain at the ankle.

D: OK, so the metatarsals are not having any pain and then the joints of the 2nd 5th digits are pain free along with the ankle as well. Um and when it comes to range of motion, are you able to flex your toes downwards and extend them upwards towards your nose?

P: Yes, I can do that.

D: OK, and how about your ankle, are you able to um move your ankle on a full range of motion.

P: I can.

D: OK, and are you having a limping with, walking or otherwise called an antalgic gait?

P: Somewhat because I'm trying not to put too much weight on my right big toe.

D: OK. Alright, and so I think that was everything that I wanted to ask and check today. So did you have any other questions or anything that I maybe forgot to ask about you wanted to mention today?

P: Um no just what can I do for my foot how do I make the swelling go down?

D: Yeah, for sure it's so right now with having a like a red, warm and swollen joint that that's extremely tender and has limited range of motion. It's important to rule out a septic arthritis, however. Based on several of the risk factors such as diabetes, and obesity, as well as your family history of arthritis and gout. Taking the most likely thing is that this is a gout flare, and in particular in the toe like that it could be called podagra and so we will need to get a aspiration of the joint fluid just to send it off and make sure that it's not not an infection and that we're treating the right thing. If this is, gout and it comes back that this way it's treated with that high dose, high doses of anti inflammatories. I will start with medication called colchicine to help with this flare, and in the meantime, important things for preventing this in the future are diet and kind of lifestyle related with reducing things like red meats, alcohol, weight loss and um just trying to improve the diabetes management as well.

P: OK, that sounds great. Thank you.

Some what, because I'm trying not to put too much weight on my right big toe. Okay. All right, and so I think that was everything that I wanted to ask and I checked today. So did you have any other questions or anything that I maybe forgot to ask about you wanted to mention today? No, just what can I do for my? What how do I make the swelling go down? Yeah, for sure. It's so right now with having a like a red warm and swollen joint that's that's extremely tender and has limited range of motion. We it's important to rule out a septic arthritis however based on several of the the risk factors such as diet or diabetes and some obesity as well as your family history of arthritis and gout. Thinking the most likely thing is that this is a gout flare and in particular in the toe like that it could be called podagra. And so we'll need to get a aspiration of the joint fluid just to send it off and make sure that it's not not an infection and that we're treating the the right thing. If this is gout and it comes back that this way it's treated with that high dose high doses of anti-inflammatories and we'll start with medication called the colchicine to help with this flare. And in the meantime important things for preventing this in the future are diet and kind of lifestyle related with reducing things like red meats, alcohol, weight loss, and just trying to improve the diabetes management as well. Okay, that sounds great. Thank you. All right, thank you. We'll get that started."," How may I help you? I am here because I've had this intense pain in my right foot for the past six hours or so, and I thought it was important to come get it checked out by you guys. Okay. So it started six hours ago. Has the pain been getting anywhere else or are you just feeling it at that one spot i'm feeling it just in that one spot worse like putting socks on or even having um i don't know i don't know clothing touch it or your shoes touch it yeah i guess yeah my shoes my shoes touching it hurts okay and how about any muscle weakness no nothing like that all right and uh have you had any uh any headaches no no headaches have you had any chest pain? No. And how about any, uh, uh, heart palpitations or, um, feeling like your heart is racing? No. Okay. Um, and, uh, have you had any lightheadedness or a dizziness? No. Okay. And how about your energy? Have you had fatigue or malaise recently? No, nothing like that. All right. And any muscle aches or body pains or any joint pains anywhere else? No. Okay. And have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past? Um, no, I okay um and have you had any prior hospitalizations or surgeries um i was recently hospitalized for uh kidney stones but that since um has resolved okay have you i usually have about two glasses of wine a day okay and has that changed uh recently for you um no shellfish uh i eat a lot of red meat um but not a lot of um seafood okay um and um okay anybody And on my mother's side, there's some arthritis there as well, and as well as gout and kidney stones. Okay. So that was everything I wanted to ask on the history. And so next I'll ask you to have a look at your feet, and are you seeing, um, deformities, like it just looks swollen and, um, so there's like a big bump on the right side of my foot where it's, uh, it's completely straight on my left. Uh, but other than that, no deformities. Okay. Okay of motion are you able to flex your toes downwards and extend them upwards towards your nose yes i can do that okay and how about your ankle are you able to um um with having a like a red um warm and swollen joint that's that's extremely tender and has limited range of motion it's treated with high doses of anti-inflammatories. And we'll start with a medication called Colchicine to help with this flare. And in the meantime, important things for preventing this in the future Here are..."

D: OK, and have you had any issues with your shoulder before like like a subacromial like impingement syndrome or like a rotator cuff pains or problems in the past?

P: A few years ago I did have some pain um with like some, they they told me not to do like overhead work like just things that require like with Physio I need to do some strengthening as well and it was it wasn't the same same shoulder.

D: OK. And do you take any medications regularly?

P: Uh, no.

D: OK, and do you have any allergies?

P: No.

D: Have you had any hospitalizations or prior surgeries?

D: OK, and for the shoulder in the past did you have any imaging done like an ultrasound or or MRI maybe to look at the structures?

P: No, it was just a it kind of went away. I just did some physio they didn't really do any imaging.

D: I see OK. And can you tell me a little about your living situation right now, like you're living with and where?

P: Yeah so I'm living with my wife and um daughter and I'm living just in a condominium in the city.

D: OK, and are you working right now?

P: Yeah, so I'm an accountant. I'm working from home, so it's not that bad, but I I might just take a few days off depending on what I have to do with this injury.

D: OK, and um do you and hobby wise you mentioned like weight lifting, are you an active person like bodybuilding and that sort of thing regularly? 

P: I I just actually probably started this past year. I used to. I used to workout a lot. In University and in my early 30s but then I stopped and this year I've kind of gone back into it.

D: OK, well it's good that you're staying active. And um do you smoke cigarettes?

P: No, I uh, probably tried a couple times and. High School and University, but just it was never my thing.

D: OK, and how about cannabis, like smoking marijuana or using any of those types of products?

P: No, I I try to stay away from any drugs.

D: OK, uh, including recreational drugs?

P: Yeah.

D: OK and. Uh, are there any musculoskeletal or neurological problems that that run in the family?

P: Not that I know of, no.

D: OK, now how about any autoimmune diseases?

P: Uh, no, I don't think so.

D: OK, so next I just wanted to ask you to have a look at the at the arm. Compared to the other side, are you noticing any swelling, redness, or?

P: Yeah, any swelling or redness, I do see some just like kind of like in the middle of this area, some redness kind of looks like some bruising in in that in that region. Uhm, I also feel like when I like try to flex my biceps kind of have moved upwards.

D: OK, is this the mass or lump that I you were mentioning earlier that you kinda can notice in the in your right arm? 

P: Yeah yeah.

D: OK, is there any temperature change, like does it feel warm on that side?

P: Uhm I can't really tell if it's warm or not.

D: OK, and you so you mentioned are you able to bend your elbow all the way up so to flex it all the way up, or is a range of motion limited?

P: It's pretty limited. It's pretty tough to flex. It's really painful and that I also can't like. I can't turn my arm, I can't supinate.

D: OK so yeah, so is that so you have reduced supination as well?

P: Yeah.

D: And how are your shoulder movement, are you able to like if you're lifting your arms straight out in front of you, are you able to to lift them all the way up above your head?

P: Out like at the sides or in front of me?

D: In front of you. 

P: Yeah, the shoulder seems to be OK. I am able to lift up, but it's just if I try to move my upper arms at all it hurts a lot.

D: OK, alright so. You'll get some pain at the at the shoulder with the movement.

P: There there is discomfort in the affected side, but I can I can move it much more than I can move my elbows or anything like that. 

D: OK, I see. So I think that was everything that I wanted to ask about and and I look for on on the physical today. Was there anything I may be missed or anything like that? 

P: Uhm no I think, uh, I don't have any other questions.

D: OK, alright, so based on the history and what you're telling me for the physical as well of having a history of exercising and also shoulder pain with overhead head movements which are risk factors for developing a biceps, tendon tear or biceps tendon injury. And having the swelling and bruising as well as reduced function of biceps or elbow flexion, they all suggests that there is a biceps, tendon tear, or injury there, and so will want to get an ultrasound or MRI to look at will start with the ultrasound, but then possibly get an MRI as well to look at the extent of the tissue damage, but if there is just a long head of biceps tear, it will usually be treated conservatively. And so we'll just need to look to see what the extent of the injury is.

And now over the last two days I've been just feeling so much pressure around my nose and around my jaw so I've been getting a lot of pain there as well.

D: OK, is your nose still running?

P: Yeah, I'm still getting some discharge and I also feel like I'm getting some dripping at the back of my throat too, especially when I wake up.

D: OK, and could you describe the discharge? Is it clear, yellow, greenish?

P: Uh, it's fairly clear and sometimes, like a bit white, but like, it's not like green or yellow.

D: OK, uh, and have you felt that it's difficult to breathe in through either of your nostrils, like it's obstructed?

P: Yeah, so at night sometimes I have to like turn because one side of my nose gets difficult to breathe from and then it kind of balances out on the other side. So yeah, I do have some obstruction.

D: OK, and have you had any changes to your sense of smell?

P: Yeah, so just in the last three days when the congestion got really bad I started losing the ability to smell.

D: OK, have you had any changes to your sense of taste?

P: No, taste is fine. 

D: OK, and have you had any cough or sore throat?

P: Uh, no. No cough or sore throat.

D: OK, and the symptoms have gone on for five days. Have you had a period of time where you got better and then got sick again? 

P: I did kind of have a runny nose last week as well, so probably like 8 days ago but then the runny nose discontinued a little bit but really got worse 5 days ago, but all these other symptoms just happened in the last few days.

D: OK, and you have pain. Do you feel it in your jaw or do you feel it in the in the front of your nose?

P: Yes, I would say mainly over the cheeks. It can kind of go near the front of my teeth as well, so like I would say like mostly around the cheeks, jaws and up to the front of my teeth. 

D: OK, And do you grind your teeth at all at night? or have you had, TMJ issues before?

P: No nothing like that. I think it's not so much on and around my teeth, it's more so just to right below my nose, above my teeth and just around my cheeks.

D: OK, so no pain in your mouth or anything like that?

P: No, not inside my mouth.

D: OK, have you had any fevers or chills?

P: Uhm, I Don't think I've had a fever. I did feel some chills over the last few days, but just very brief episodes.

D: OK, and over the last few weeks have you had any weight loss? 

P: No.

D: OK, and you said you didn't have a cough or a sore throat, but have you had any wheezing?

P: No wheezing.

D: How about any shortness of breath?

P: Uh, not shortness of breath. Just sometimes when my nose gets like really congested, I just turn into like a mouth breather, but that's about it.

D: OK, and, uh, sorry to go back to this, I don't think I asked. Did you notice any discharge from your eyes or any eye redness?

P: Not discharge, but yeah, maybe a little bit of redness.

P: Uh, no, not that I know.

D: OK, so you don't experience any symptoms like this when the seasons change?

P: I don't think so. I have had this happen to me, Uh, I would say like once before. It happened like two years ago. It was pretty similar. 

D: OK, uhm, and what was done at that time?

P: At that time it kind of just went away on it's own. It got better. I feel it's definitely worse this time. But at that time I didn't even go to the doctor, it kind of just went away.

D: OK, I see. Any recent hospitalizations?

P: No hospitalizations.

D: Any surgeries?

P: Nope. 

D: Alright, and could you tell me where abouts you're living currently and who you're living with?

P: No,  I think that's all. I just didn't know if I needed any, like, medications or if I needed to get tested. I just wanted to make sure.

D: Yeah, so well, certainly check your temperature to see if you have a fever. And if you do and it's high enough, that will increase the chance that you have a bacterial sinusitis,  and if so, with some of your symptoms, including the discharge, obstruction, loss of smell, and facial pain, that all fits the picture for it and also you had a period where you felt a little bit better and then worse again. So that might require antibiotics, but we will check your temperature and go from there.

P: He did have a similar pain, I think when he was like around three years old, but it happened with his left left ear, not the right one.

D: OK, was he prescribed any medications?

P: Uh yeah, he was given a, like a course of antibiotics at that time. I forgot what it was called, but I think at that time it was much worse, like he, I don't know if he was just younger and couldn't tolerate it but I think he also had a fever at that time.

D: OK, OK, and then any other ear infections outside of that one time.

P: No, I think that, only that one I can recall.

D: And any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions.

P: No lung or heart conditions. Just, his father does have like celiac disease, so I don't know if that's related at all.

D: OK, how old was he when was diagnosed with celiac?

P: Fairly young I would say, in his 20s.

D: OK, OK, uhm, alright, we'll keep an eye on it in him, like if he has any changes in his bowel movements or if he's getting severe abdominal pain after eating certain foods with gluten you can get him checked up for that as well.

P: OK. 

D: Yeah and then, in terms of where he lives, does he live with you and your partner?

P: Yeah, so it's just, he's an only child, lives with me and my husband, and also we have like a pet dog.

D: OK, do you live in an apartment or in a house?

P: We live in a, it's like a condominium.

D: OK, OK, any old carpet, mold or asbestos in the building?

P: No, no, nothing like that. It's fairly well kept. 

D: OK, And is he other-wise like developmental-wise, he's OK? There's no past history of like developmental disorders, anything like that?

P: No, no issues from like when he was younger like no complaints at all. I Think he was doing the same as every other child.

D: OK, no complications during your pregnancy with him, no complications during the actual delivery and then when he was a newborn?

P: Uh no, no complications, it was just a vaginal birth at 39 weeks and we didn't need to stay in the hospital at all afterwards.

D: OK, good. So those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?

P: Yeah, I don't know if, uh, like last time we did get some antibiotics. I don't know if he needs them right now or what would you recommend?

D: Yeah, uhm so I'm gonna have to take a look into his ears first before I can come up with like a management plan for him. So once I do, if I see, uhm, if his tympanic membrane has been perforated or I see pus in there, we'll prescribe him like 10 days of antibiotics. We can give him either Amoxicillin, or if he has bad reactions to penicillins,  we can give him Cefuroxime and then if, uh, it doesn't seem to have any systemic symptoms, so if he has systemic symptoms like fever, which we'll check for today, and if he's like been really ill and he has like a middle ear effusion or bulging tympanic membrane, again we'll give him antibiotics for 10 days. But if his tympanic membrane is just bulging a little bit, or if he has some middle ear effusion but no systemic symptoms, like, no fevers, and he seems to be fine otherwise, we'll reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see if he's better and if he's not, again, will prescribe him antibiotics. How does that sound?

P: Yeah, maybe, he has a younger sister that goes to daycare and she was sick last week with like she had a cough and stuff as well.

D: OK. OK, and does she have a fever as well?

P: She did, yeah, she got better. Right uh, last week we we had to take her to to see the doctor and she got antibiotics for that. Actually for, for a few days. 

D: OK, OK. And have you traveled anywhere recently?

P: No, we've been at home.

D: OK. Does anyone at home smoke?

P: No. 

D: No, OK. And who lives at home with him?

P: So it's me, his mom, and then his younger sister.

D: OK. Any old carpets, mold, dust, asbestos, anything that could exacerbate his condition?

P: No, I don't think so. It's a newer home. 

D: OK, good. Umm, so those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own?

P: Uhm, no, I, no that was everything I think. The only I I guess other thing that that I forgot to mention is that just he doesn't really like his appetite's been a little bit lower couple of days as well. But uh, he hasn't had any, like nausea or vomiting though.

D: OK, OK, yeah, that's good to know. Uhm, so because some of his symptoms overlap with those of Covid, we will do a swab on him and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results and he should isolate for 14 days because of those symptoms. And it doesn't, it sounds more in keeping with the picture of community acquired pneumonia, so for that we will get a chest x-ray, we'll check his oxygen and his temperature and if the chest x-ray shows consolidation umm, or some sort of infiltrate, it is likely that he has pneumonia. So, we will start by giving him some amoxicillin populate or cefuroxime for five days, and just keep monitoring his symptoms. They should resolve in about 5 days when the course of antibiotics is complete. If his condition gets worse like he's getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, just take him to the ER. And if symptoms don't resolve in five to seven days, we can do further work up or things like fungal infections or TB, or things like that. How does that sound?

P: That sounds great. Thank you.

Um this um didn't look like that, it was more, it was just kind of sore in one spot, I don't think it um it was as bad as that time and the tick that time, sorry I've kind of gotten off track, that time it was quite swollen, this one was maybe a little bit, but not as much.

D: OK, so just in terms of the tick's size, it doesn't look like it's been feeding for too long, so when ticks uh are feeding they tend to engorge, they tend to swell up, so this looks more like a tiny little bug or does it kind of look like a little grape, almost like it's been swollen up with blood?

P: No, this one, this one's pretty small.

D: This one's pretty small, OK. And I should mention that, well obviously you've had a tick bite in the past, the big concern for us is a disease called Lyme disease, which is spread by bacteria, but in fact only one type of tick predominantly is a transmission transmitory agent for it. It's called a deer tick, and its coloration, it's got a little bit of a brown butt and there's some black legs. Does it look like that at all?

P: I don't think so, uhm, I uh I was looking at the pictures online, I think it looks like the other kind of tick, um but I heard that, yeah, but I heard that lately now they've been considering all ticks in this area as possibly carriers of Lyme um because I think it's kind of become more more of a problem sm so that was making me a bit nervous.

D: OK, absolutely, what we can do is we can send this tick off to the lab and they'll be able to identify the species for it, but for tick bites in general, one of the key considerations is for how long it's been on your body for. So unfortunately, if you're out on Friday and Saturday, that'd mean that this tick has been on you for longer than at least 72 hours. So I think one way or another, we're likely going to have to put you on antibiotics just as kind of a prophylactic at the very least, just want to make sure that um you're not at risk of developing Lyme disease. I'm sure you've heard from the news that Lyme disease can present in a variety of ways, but it's a disease that we try our best to avoid. And just in terms of your symptoms, so you say you've had a bite in the past and you you've got that rash before, that kind of bullseye rash, do you have that rash now?

P: No, I don't uh as far as I know, I mean, you can have a look too. It's behind my knee, so it's not the easiest place to see, but it's uh it looks a little red, it's like tender where the tick was, but I don't see that like larger circle rash.

D: OK, that's reassuring. Now any, it'd be pretty unlikely for you to have other symptoms, but just in case, do you have any other joint pain? 

P: No.

D: Have you been feeling ill or have been feverish in the last little while?

P: No, no, I've been fine.

D: OK, and you removed that twit tick once you found it, you presented to me, have you checked your body for any other possible bites?

P: Oh yeah, I looked around and I looked at my husband too 'cause we we were just a little bit, you know, gave us a little bit of a scare, but no, there's been nothing else.

D: That's good. And did you bring a pet with you at all when you were hiking and gardening?

P: Uh no, I didn't, no.

D: OK, good. Any other family members you think might have been exposed?

P: Uh no it was just uh me and my husband.

D: OK, and what geographic area were you in um when you were hiking?

P: We were uh in Strathroy along the creek.

D: OK. I can do, if I remember there's a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario and we can see exactly how that lines up to see if we should be a little bit concerned or not. Looks like Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point, so I think that we will be moving forward with antibiotics, but of course we'll be talking to the physician who'll be having a look at you as well. So it sounds like you haven't been having too much symptoms aside from you've noticed this tick, the skin around it is fairly sore and you've had this in the past, but you were treated with antibiotics in the past and since then you haven't had too many health problems after that?

P: No, no. I've been pretty healthy.

D: OK, and just about your health right now, is there anything that you see the family physician or doctor for in general and regarding your health?

P: Uh just for my cholesterol.

D: OK, are you taking and medications for that?

P: Uh Yeah, I take a uh statin, can't remember which one. 

D: OK, got it. And do you have any allergies?

P: Uh no.

D: So no drug allergies?

P: No.

D: OK, now we've already talked about other exposures, so it doesn't sound like anyone else in your family or any pets are around, so it's unlikely that you have ticks coming in and you said you might have gotten this from gardening, but um you're hoping that your area doesn't have ticks. Maybe just take a look, ticks like to live in long grass, kind of on the intersection between woods and fields to see if there's any hovering around that kind of make a waving motion with their legs and they're sometimes easy to spot, you might wanna get some insecticide out there. But it sounds like this is fairly recent, unfortunately just for the length of time this tick might be on you for, it's probably safer than not to start you on some medications, but I'm going to go talk to the doctor after we do a quick physical exam, and we might also send the tick off to a local laboratory so they can identify the species for it definitively, as well as might just send some blood work just to see if there's any titres or any serology that would make us a little bit more concerned for Lyme disease. But aside from that you've been feeling well otherwise?

P: Yeah, totally fine. It was just a little tender there and that's the only reason I looked.

D: OK. So no headaches?

P: No.

D: Nothing like that?

P: Nothing like that. 

D: OK, excellent, alright. I'm fairly happy with what we talked about today. Do you have any questions for me Jean? 

P: No, this is pretty well what I expected today, so thanks for helping me out.

D: No problem. OK, I'll go talk to the doctor, we'll come back and talk to you, OK? 

P: Great, thanks.

D: Thanks Jean.",513.843125,us_medical,"So I understand you removed an insect from your leg earlier today? Yes, I did. It was behind my left knee, kind of in the joint behind where it bends.

Not the joint itself, but just the skin, the whole area back there. And I found this tick I brought in with me. If you wanted to have a look at it. It's in this little plastic container. And I don't really know when I got it. I was hiking on Friday. And then Saturday I was out in my garden. I hope they're not around my house. I hope that it was from hiking and not gardening, but I did spend a lot of time outside on Saturday as well. Okay, so it sounds like it's been a little bit of time since you were last outdoors to when you first noticed it. Yeah. Okay, so when you picked off the tick, obviously you have it for me. Is it quite swollen or engorged? It's not too bad. I have actually had a tick in the past. And this is a long time ago, and maybe like 10 years.

MSK0046,data/us_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/MSK0046.mp3,"D: What brings you here today?

P: Um I'm here because my left hand, kind of just like at the base of my thumb, has been hurting for the past two days and it seems to be getting worse, um and I'm left handed so it's really hard for me to write or do anything um where I have to like, clench or grip things.

D: OK, and how long has this been going on for?

P: Uhm, so for the past two days, but it's got, it got bad yesterday.

D: OK, and have you had any, uh if you were to describe the pain, where is it located exactly?

P: It's just at the base of my thumb. Uh you know where the fleshy part of your hand is?

D: OK yeah yeah.

P: Yeah, so just just over there.

D: OK, and what kind of pain is it? Is it sharp or is it aching?

P: Uhm, it's it's like a um, at baseline it's an achy pain, but if I try to move it or um try to write or you know, use a computer or anything like that, it becomes sharp. 

D: OK, Um and on a scale of uh zero to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've felt in your life, how much would you rate it?

P: I'd say like a 6.

D: OK, and does this pain move anywhere else in your hand, or does it just stay where you described?

P: Um it just stays there. 

D: OK, and what kind of motions uh cause the most pain?

P: I'd say like um you know, trying to touch my pinky with my thumb, that that hurts. Um just like trying to rotate it hurts.

D: OK, um have you tried anything for the pain that has helped? 

P: Uhm, no, I haven't really tried too much. I've just I just tried not to use it as much.

D: I see. OK. And um, has this ever like, have you ever had any injuries to this hand? Any trauma either recently or in the past?

P: No, no, nothing like that.

D: OK. Alright, and is there any, do you do any kind of repetitive work that requires gripping or lifting um with that hand, anything repetitive?

P: So I do a lot of work at the computer. And um I guess I tend to type a lot with my left hand, so maybe that.

D: OK.

P: And sorry I also take lots of notes, like handwritten notes with my left hand.

D: OK, so are you left handed? 

P: Yes.

D: OK. Alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?

P: No. 

D: No, so you're healthy?

P: Yes.

D: Um do you take any medications on a regular basis? 

P: Uh no, no.

D: No, OK. Any allergies to any medications?

P: Um no allergies.

D: OK, um any previous surgeries or hospitalizations?

P: No.

D: No, any family history of any medical conditions, whether it's musculoskeletal, rheumatological, any conditions?

P: Uh no, nothing like that.

D: OK, um any cancers in the family?

P: Um I know there's, yeah there's a lot of cancer in the family. There's colon cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer. 

D: OK. And are they first degree relatives who had those cancers?

P: Uh no first degree relatives, just like aunts and uncles. 

D: OK. Uh alright, and currently are you working right now or have you had any time off work or any modified duties?

P: Um so I'm still working online, I've just um haven't been taking notes by hand anymore.

D: I see, and does that help though? 

P: Uh yeah it it has helped a little bit because I'm not moving my hand as much so it helps with the pain. 

D: OK. Have you taken any uh Tylenol, Advil, anything for the pain? 

P: No, I haven't.

D: OK. Alright. And currently right now, what is your living situation like?

P: Uh I live in an apartment by myself.

D: OK, and um, do you currently uh smoke cigarettes? 

P: Um I smoke, I used to smoke like five years ago, and I only did that for like a year or two, um and it wasn't very much. But I don't smoke anymore.

D: OK, that's good. Um any alcohol?

P: Um I'll have like a beer on the weekend.

D: OK. Any recreational drugs like marijuana?

P: Um I will take an edible like once a month.

D: OK. Um and yeah, those were just some of the questions I had um and we're just going to do a few things for examining, examining uh that area. So are you able to make a fist?

P: Um I can, but it hurts.

D: OK, it hurts in that location that you mentioned?

P: Yes. 

D: How about um if you make a fist without your thumb, does it still hurt or is it just when you are moving the thumb?

P: It's just when I'm moving the thumb.

D: OK. And if you were able to, are you able to uh rotate your wrist?

P: Uh yes, I can rotate my wrist.

D: Does that hurt at all? 

P: No.

D: OK, um now I just want you to do this one test. It's called a Finkelstein test. OK so I want you to flex your thumb, press it up down against your palm.

P: OK. 

D: And then hold your hand, sorry.

P: No, go ahead.

D: Yeah, and then after you do that, um, bring your fingers above your thumb, so just cover your thumb.

P: OK.

D: Kind of like a fist, but your thumb is on the inside of your fingers.

P: OK.

D: And then bring your uh arm out.

P: OK. 

D: And with your other hand, can you, from above push your wrist downwards? So your uh pinky finger is uh pointing to the pointing to the ground.

P: OK, yep.

D: Yeah, and did that hurt at all? Like when you, so this is just called ulnar deviation or your um of your wrist. Does that hurt at all?

P: Yes, that is very painful.

D: That's very painful, OK. Alright, um and then you're also having pain with gripping and, OK, so those are kind of all the things I wanted to ask. Uh it seems that you may be having something called De Quervain's tenosynovitis. Um it's caused by some repetitive motions, uh it can be due to gripping. Sometimes it happens to new mothers who are lifting their children as well as daycare workers. It can also happen in other work environments, and so what we will first just need to do um is mainly to rule out something like osteoarthritis. You are fairly young um but if there was ever an injury in the past, it you can have early osteoarthritis in the area. So we just want to get an X-Ray. And other than that, the way we kind of deal with this issue is usually conservatively and with a splint. 

P: OK. 

D: And a sling for your thumb that uh helps relieve some of these symptoms, uh restricts some of your movements, reduces some of the swelling, and if it does get really bad and it's affecting your work and conservative management with pain and the splint don't work, and with physiotherapy, we do uh offer injecting corticosteroids into just right like in the area that you mentioned, right below the thumb.

P: OK. 

D: Um and that often has some effect as well. Um but at first, yeah, let's just do some conservative management and see if that helps. It's only been a few days, so hopefully um what we try first helps. And then we can go on from there.

P: OK yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.

D: Well, it is sounding like it could be most likely an infectious type of process going on with the possibility of having a fever with a cough and sore throat. So we'll do a physical exam and also some investigations which will include a covid test today. Because some of these symptoms do overlap, but it could be something like the common cold. I don't know the virus that's bringing this on but it's not necessarily covid. But because we're doing the test, it will require 14 days of self isolation.

P: Yeah, it's been mostly the the family members. My husband's been working from home and the kids have been helpful as well. They are 10 and 12 so they are able to do some things on their own so yeah they've been supportive.

D: That's great. That's great. OK, and you smoke at all?

P: I do yes I I smoke about a half a pack per day. 

D: For how long?

P: Um, yeah, but I I started in my, yeah, after the kids were born actually, uh so like 10 years ago.

D: OK, have you tried cutting it down at all? 

P: Yeah, I have. I've kind of gone through spurts of quitting and restarting, quitting and restarting. So yeah, I've tried before.

D: OK, and what about marijuana or recreational drugs?

P: No, don't use anything like that.

D: And alcohol? 

P: Yeah I'll have some wine on the on the weekends, but maybe that's like a glass or two.

D: OK, OK uhm, and do you have any medical conditions that long run in the family?

D: OK OK uhm. You haven't ever had one, have you?

P: No, I I haven't had anything like that. 

D: OK, alright. So. I guess come to in terms of smoking, you said that you've tried to quit a couple of times in the past. Do you intend on trying again? I know it can be very hard to, to quit smoking.

P: Yeah, it's only something that is always kind of in the back of my mind.

D: OK, if there's I'm happy to assist you and share resources and problems like medications and things like that that could help you if you're interested so we can talk more about that. talking about your I guess you mentioned that your weight is a little higher than or, its outside the normal range, is that something that you would like to cut down?

P: Yeah, I really try to eat more vegetables and have been trying to do that sort of thing. I've lost a few pounds, but not enough, definitely want to keep going.

D: OK, good good, as long as you feel that you what you're currently doing is helping you and is helping you reduce weight. That's great. But also I'm here for you if you need more education or guidance on that. So, given what you've told me so far, it sounds like you might have developed a clot in your leg somewhere, simply because you had a surgery and you were not moving around very much. Sometimes that causes the blood to kind of, not move around your body is as as much as it usually does, and kind of stays in one place and get turned into a clot and that clot can sometimes get dislodged and settle into your lungs, and that can make it difficult for you to breathe. So, we'll do some tests that that's what my understanding is. Given what you've told me so far, but we do have to confirm it using a test. Also, the fact that you smoke and your weight, and your BMI is high, increases your risk of developing a clot, so I would definitely strongly recommend that you continue to try to reduce both and try to quit smoking. And so we'll do an ultrasound of your leg and we'll do a scan of your chest and see what's going on and then decide if we need to give you any medications, like any blood thinning medications.

P: OK, yeah, that sounds really good. Thank you.

MSK0045,data/us_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/MSK0045.mp3,"D: What brings you here today?

P: Um so I'm here because my shoulder has been really painful for the past week um and any movement of that shoulder, of my right shoulder, causes a lot of pain.

D: OK, and how long have you been having uh this pain for?

P: For the past week,

D: Past week, OK. Um and did you injure your shoulder at all recently? Any trauma to the area or anything like that?

P: Um so about like, a couple of months ago, I um was do, I I work in construction so um I was moving around some heavy objects and um I guess like the repetitive motions caused some sort of rotator cuff injury. But I had that um, like I got that treated and everything was fine for a couple of months. But this pain just started a week ago.

D: OK, and where is this pain located exactly?

P: Um it's it's just like in my shoulder, like at the joint between my upper arm and um shoulder.

D: OK, and uh is it an aching pain or is it a sharp stabbing pain?

P: So at rest it seems to be like achy and stiff, but um but when I move my shoulder, when I try to move it, it it causes more of a sharp pain.

D: Sharp pain, OK and what kind of movements cause the sharp pain? Or is it just any movement?

P: Uh any movement.

D:  OK. Are there any uh movements that are worse in particular?

P: Um I think um, like no, anything hurts.

D: OK. OK, and how much would you rate this pain out, on a scale of zero to 10, 10 being the worst pain you felt in your life?

P: I'd give it about a 7. 

D: Seven, OK.

P: Yeah.

D: And are you having uh, is this pain moving to any other uh joints or any other part of your body?

P: No. 

D: OK, so just just in the area that you described?

P: Yes. 

D: OK, and do you notice any kind of um, just looking at your shoulder outside, from the outside, any swelling, redness, any masses or deformities?

P: No, I don't see anything like that.

D: OK, alright and um is there anything that you've tried that has helped with your pain?

P: Um I've tried some ibuprofen, some ice. It seems to help temporarily.

D: OK, and earlier when you had the rotator cuff injury, did you get physiotherapy? 

P: Um I did. But not, but I didn't finish the full course. I just went for a week or so and then um I had to go back to work, um so I stopped doing that.

D: I see, um yeah, so that's something definitely uh it's very important and we'll need to consider going forward as well. Other than that, are you having any symptoms of any fevers or chills?

P: Uh no, nothing like that.

D: OK, and have you been sick recently at all or met with someone who was sick?

P: No.

D: OK, any any weight loss um or loss of appetite? Anything like that?

D: Any weakness in your extremities?

P: No.

D: Any um any just symptoms or anything else like diarrhea, constipation, urinary changes? Anything else is going on?
 
P: No. 

D: No, OK. So it's mainly just the shoulder pain?

P: Yes. 

D: OK, um alright, and does rest help at all, like when you're lying down, just not moving your shoulder. Does that help with your pain?

P: Uh, yeah I would say so.

D: OK. And is is this stiffness there just throughout the day, or is it there in the morning and then gets better during the day?

P: It's pretty much there all day.

D: OK. Alright um and have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?

D: OK, and do you take any medications?

P: No. 

D: OK, and currently right now, so you said you work as a construction worker, right?

P: Yes.

D: And are you off of work right now, or have you been off work um due to your previous injury and pain, or are you still working?

P: I'm still working, but modified, um so I am not uh lifting any heavy objects or anything like that. I'm just doing some like groundwork.

D: OK, that's good. Yeah, I mean, um we might also need to, if you're doing any kind of overhead like work where you're raising your arms above your shoulders, that might uh, cause further problems as well, so we'll look into some of those modified duties as well.

P: OK.

D: Um yeah, and what is your living situation like right now? Who do you live with?

P: Um I live by myself right now.

D: Do you live in a house or apartment?

P: Um I live in an apartment. 

D: And, uh, uh, in terms of your daily life, do you smoke at all?

P: Um I don't smoke. I used to smoke before, but that was like 20 years ago.

D: OK, that's good, and do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana or any other drugs?

P: Uh no, no.

D: How about smoking, you smoke cigarettes? Sorry, you said you you quit. Um do you drink alcohol?

P: I'll drink like a glass of wine here and there.

D: OK. Alright, um yeah, and those were some of the questions I had for you. In terms of just a physical examination, uh when you press on the area that you describe, um when you press around the area, does it hurt?

P: I have to press pretty hard for it to hurt.

D: OK, but otherwise it's not tender?

P: No.

D: OK, and again, no swelling, redness, or anything like that, just it's mainly just on the inside?

P: Yeah.

D: OK, and um and any kind of movement hurts, right? There's no particular movement that, like if you were instead of um trying to raise that shoulder by itself, if you were to just move it with the other arm. Does it hurt?

P: The other arm? The other arm doesn't hurt at all.

D: Or like if you were to use your left arm to to passively move your right arm and shoulder. Does that hurt or is it when you just try to move the right arm by itself?

P: It's, oh, it still hurts, any any moving of the shoulder hurts.

D:  OK, alright, so yeah, so based on what um you've told me so far in your recent shoulder cuff injury, what can sometimes happen is uh with those injuries, you might get some um inflammation and what might happen is something called uh adhesive capsulitis, or just commonly knows as known as a frozen shoulder. And there's different stages, so that might happen, so in the initial stages like freezing um and then there's stiffening in stage two, and then usually after 6 to 12 months it starts uh getting better.

P: OK.

D: Um and it might also affect your other shoulder as well. So what we'll um end up doing today is see if um we can get some um imaging done so we can do an X-Ray of your shoulder. I'm sure you've had X Rays before, so we'll kind of compare them to your shoulder X Rays from before. We, if we need to, we can also get an ultrasound if um we don't, uh we can't really tell from the X Rays. And then from there, um we can get some blood work as well. Um just your normal blood work as well as inflammation markers, and then um from there we'll need to uh, really um discuss some management strategies. So you've already tried some physiotherapy, but now we need to make sure that's uh, it's it's consistent because this is something that has a high recurrence rate and we will definitely need to finish the full course of physiotherapy, whatever it may be, um because if physiotherapy doesn't work, we may have to consider like other options like um corticosteroid injections right into your shoulder.

P: OK. 

D: For some relief.  But yeah, so first we'll just try some conservative methods like physiotherapy, pain management, uh and then go from there. How does that sound?

P: That sounds pretty good. Thank you.

D: Welcome, alright, so we'll call you for the X-Rays and then we'll go from there.

We're going to do a Covid swab just to rule that out. You should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours, but we will do investigations for lung cancer, so we'll start by doing a chest x-ray just to look for a mass or effusions and then from there if we think there are signs of cancer, we can do a CT. Umm, as well we can like stage with the Pet CT after we take a biopsy and send it off for pathology and that should give us more answers as to if you have cancer and if you do have cancer, what type of cancer so that we can talk about treatment plans and kind of what the prognosis is with those particular types of cancers?

P: Hi, I am just coming in because for the last couple of months but I've been having this, these coughing fits. Are there like when I'm going to the gym or even at home, like during the weekends when we're vacuuming and cleaning the house.

D: When did this start? 

P: Um, I would say started, uh probably 3 months back, but it's gotten worse, so like before I used to like just have some irritation in my throat and cough a little, but now, I would say probably every other day I'm having these episodes where I can't stop coughing when I'm exercising.

D: Hmm, um and is this cough a dry cough, or do you bring up some mucus?

P: It's usually, it's usually a dry cough and sometimes I do bring up like this light material, but usually it's mostly a dry cough.

D: You never notice any blood, right?

P: No, no blood.

D: OK and uhm, it started about three months ago, I guess before that did you ever have a problem when you would exercise or when you were vacuuming or cleaning, has this been a problem that has occurred for years and that's just something that you that got worse and now it's come to your attention? Or was it just very new and sudden, three months ago? 

P: Um, it's fairly new. I've never really had this issue before although I have been like so like after the new year in the winter I, I, I wasn't much of the person who ran or exercised a lot. But I, I kind of needed a new goal to become more fit and active. So I notice that, I don't know, maybe that's why like, it is something new that I've been trying, but yeah, it's not been an issue before.

D: OK, and other than the the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms like a sore throat or itchy eyes? Itchy nose? Stuffy nose or runny nose? Anything like that?

P: No, none of those, but I did it, initially I used to get just an irritation in my throat. But now it's just more of a cough.

D: OK. Do you have, do you get any pain in your chest at all?

P: Uh, when I'm usually it goes away in 10-15 minutes but when I'm coughing a lot I do get some tightness.

D: OK. Do you ever feel like you're short of breath when you're coughing or otherwise?

P: I do find that it's harder to take a breath at those times.

D: Ok. Uhm and how long do these last for? Episodes last for?

P: Probably, uh 15 to 20 minutes and yeah, it's it's mainly just after I like often times over the last few weeks I've had to just stop doing what I'm doing, like exercising and just come home and rest.

D: Do you feel like your hearts beating really fast when that happens or you're sweating?

P: Yeah, yeah, I I feel like it's usually, I don't know if it's because of the exercise, but I have like a Fitbit and it's my my heart rate is much faster.

P: Um no, not really, I've I've been really, umm, I moved back to my parents' home just for a bit right now. 

D: Ok.

P: Now, while the University has closed down, and by that I've lived there all my life before, so I don't know if that had anything to do with it.

D: Do you feel like they may have put new curtains or or like there's old carpets or new a new pet, or something that could have caused some irritation for you?

P: No, but I have noticed that when I when we vacuum. I, I do get some of those symptoms as well. Just more of an irritation mores than the cough.

D: OK. OK, and do you feel that you're particularly anxious when these episodes are occurring? Do you have any new stressors in life?

P: Uh, no, not really.

D: Any medical conditions that run in the family?

P: Uhm, I don't think so. Not that I know of.

P: So um right now I just live on my own, actually I'm um just finishing up my my my Masters um and just live in a small apartment. 

D: OK alright. And have you been in contact with anyone sick recently?

P: No, I don't believe so.

D: OK. Um how about um travel?

P: Uh no, I've just been yeah finishing up the the thesis and running. 

D: OK, alright, um those were all the questions I had for you, um we'll move on to the physical exam component of this. Um so if you can take a look at both your knees, um do you see any visible redness or swelling in the area?

P: Uh no no swelling or yeah, nothing visible that I can see.

D: OK, so no bruises?

P: Uh no, no no bruises 

D: OK. Do you notice any like muscle atrophy, any deformities or skin changes otherwise?

P: No, everything looks looks normal.

D: OK, and if you can just um place your hand just kinda at the top of your, on top of your kneecap on both sides, do you notice any temperature changes from your, uh between your right knee to your left knee?

P: No, no temperature changes, they they feel the same.

D: OK. Um and then when you palpate your knee cap as well as um yeah, just if you could palpate just at the center of your kneecap, do you feel any pain there?

P: No pain over the kneecap, that feels fine.

D: OK. How about when you palpate kind of like the medial ligaments of your kneecap, do you feel any pain there?

P: No, everything on the medial side feels feels normal and fine.

D: How about when you palpate the lateral ligaments of your kneecap?

P: Yeah, the ligaments feel feel OK, on the lateral side though I I do get some pain along the um like above the joint line.

D: Above the joint line?

P: Yeah.

D: OK, OK, and how about when you palpate uh that big muscle group on your thighs like the quadriceps?

P: That feels OK, no pain in the muscles.

D: OK, how about like the patellar tendon?

P: Uh no pain there.

D: OK. And then when you go lower below your kneecap, um when you palpate like the top part where the proximal parts of your tibia and fibula are, do you feel any pain there?

P: Uh, yeah, no pain there.

D: OK, and now let's do some um movements with your leg. Um are you sitting down?

P: Uh, yeah, I am.

D: OK, I'm gonna get you to stand up from a sitting position, does that, is that painful?

P: It is, yeah it's, I get a sharp pain if, when doing that. 

D: OK yeah, uhm how about when you um sit back down, does that hurt? 

P: Um yeah, that hurts too.

D: That hurts too, OK. Um and then how about when you flex your knee inwards, um so that your heel is touching your bum like does that hurt? 

P: Uh like I, I'll get up, uh no that doesn't hurt, that feels OK.

D: OK, how about when you extend your knee back out, straighten it all the way?

P: Yeah, that feels OK too if I'm just sitting and doing that, I can um, I can do that OK.

D: OK. Um how about when you, so you're standing and then you uh you abduct your hip so you basically, um you flex your hip but laterally and you kind of bring it upwards so that it's almost, so that your your, the action is like you're uh trying to touch the ceiling.

P: OK yeah I um, it, if, it does feel, it feels like it's kind of pulling um like it feels tight when I do that uh like on that side, it's, I don't get the same sharp pain, but it's uncomfortable.

D: OK, uhm, so I'm gonna try a special test, it's called the Ober test. So can I get you to lie on the side um with the injured knee?

P: Yep.

D: OK, and then I'm gonna get you to flex your knee at 90 degrees and um abduct and extend the hip uh while your thighs maintain in line with your trunk. Um so I'm gonna get you to adduct your thigh, so bring it back towards you, the the median, um as far as possible.

P: Oh yeah, I can't really, it's kind of like stuck out there. It feels really tight if I'm trying to like bring it, bring it back down, my leg almost like floats up if I just leave it there.

D: OK, so that is a positive Ober test. Um OK, so what it sounds like is you, it sounds like you have something called um iliotibial um band syndrome, so ITB syndrome, and basically that happens in um athletes, so depending on your like position, like how much you're using those joints um and like repetitive actions um of like knee flexion extension um kind of triggers that. And to treat it, uh we can try some conservative um things first, so the first thing would be um for you um to have some sort of activity modification to prevent aggravating that joint even more, so you're doing a lot of running, so maybe uh switching to things like swimming um for the time being can help with that. And then other things include ice or heating pads, uh taping and stretching, um and then if the pain is, if the pain uh persists, you can try some like ibuprofen for temporary relief. Um we can talk about other treatments as well, like physiotherapy because um it'll be important to kind of strengthen those muscles around that joint as well as um increase your range of motion, so we can do, we can put in a referral for that. Um and if none of those work, we can also discuss um some other things like ultrasound therapy or like muscle stimulation, um shockwave therapy, and then eventually if none of those other things work, we can discuss surgical management but uh it's rare that it ever gets to that point. Does that sound OK?

P: It does, yeah, thank you so much.

D: OK yeah, no worries.",1031.072625,us_medical,"What brings you in? Hi, I've had this pain in my left knee that's been going on now for the last three or four months. That it's gotten a bit worse.

Well, it's I think first started a few months ago but in the past couple of weeks it has started to kind of like last longer and happen at rest as well. Yeah. And so does anything make it worse or better? I assume doing any sort of physical activity makes it worse and rest makes it better. But how about anything other than that? Not really. Yeah, it's mostly just the activity if I'm going upstairs or downstairs or during running is really where it hurts the most. And that's what's bugged me the most running. Okay, okay.

A 6. Okay. Alright. And have you ever experienced this type of pain before? I did have something similar like many years ago. I used to be a rower in undergrad and I got some similar pains before.

Okay. And you said you were, are you still rowing? No, no. The only activity that I'm doing now is running. Running, okay. And from when it started to now, in the past couple of weeks, has it changed like dramatically? Is it affecting your day-to-day life? A little bit, yeah, like, even now, just walking, I can feel it.

And seeing that you're not feeling very well, you might require oxygen, we're going to keep you here in the ER, and we might have to, you might have to be hospitalized. We'll measure your vitals, do a physical exam, do a chest x-ray and you might be having, as I mentioned earlier, in exacerbation, upper COPD or a worsening of your COPD, potentially because you might have an infection, either a viral infection or bacterial infection that can sometimes worsen your COPD symptoms. You might be started on an antibiotic we'll be putting you in oxygen and giving you some steroid some, are you actually about that, are you, are you using any puffers at home?

RES0048,data/us_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/RES0048.mp3,"D: What brings you in?

P: Yeah, so I just came in because I've been having this cough that's getting worse over the last uh one and a half week and uh, I've also just recently in the last few days been getting some shortness of breath. Um and I also noticed uh my bowel movements have changed a little bit as well over the last week.

D: OK, so yeah, let's break this down. The cough, when did that start?

P: The cough, I think it started uh probably like around 10 days ago.

D: 10 days ago, OK, and how about the shortness of breath?

P: That just started in the last uh I think 3 days.

D: OK, and then the the bowel bowel changes, when did that start? 

P: Yes, I think it also started in like, I would say, for the last three days I've been getting uh diarrhea. 

D: OK OK, so let's go back to the cough, is it constant or um is it triggered by certain things like the cold air, dust, um you know, um, certain times of the day, like morning, evening?

P: Um, I would say it's pretty pretty constant since the last like 10 days, uh it's, there's no real pattern to it, and I've mostly just been inside my house. I don't think there are any triggers or I don't own any pets or anything like that, no new rugs, like uh, no no new changes really in my house.

D: OK, OK and um have you tried anything to make it better?

P: Um, no, not really. I I've done some uh home remedies like trying to do one of those steam steam masks and see if that helps, but it didn't really do anything.

D: OK. Um and how about um the quality of that cough? Is it, does it sound harsh?

P: Um, yeah I would say it's getting a little bit harsh. It's more just like, I'm not bringing anything up, it's more like a dry cough um, but yeah, I would say it's getting worse, definitely.

D: OK. Um, is it a dry cough then, or are you producing a little bit of sputum or blood or anything like that?

P: No, no, I haven't seen any blood at all and rarely do I bring like up some sputum, but like most of the time it's just a dry cough.

D: OK, it's a dry cough. Um and would you say the cough's getting worse?

P: Yeah, I'd definitely say in the last um three to four days I've been just coughing nonstop, it's very irritating. 

D: Yeah, have you experienced anything like this before?

P: Um, probably a few years ago, I think I caught the flu or something and got really sick with a fever and just a lot of coughing. But since then, nothing else. 

D: OK. Um the shortness of breath, 1 to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is it?

P: Uh probably like a five. It kind of just started out with uh, three days ago, was kind of like I just
couldn't take deep breaths like I noticed that my breathing was getting a little bit more more shallow and now it's, especially when I'm coughing, it's like I really have to sit down and catch my breath.

D: Yeah, um does anything make the shortness of breath worse? Like I guess um you know exertion, uh laying down, anything like that?

P: Um, not really. Maybe like sitting down helps sometimes, but even when I'm sitting down I'm still coughing. 

D: OK. OK and um do you have any wheeziness?

P: No, I don't think so. 

D: OK, any chest pain?

P: Um, maybe from all the coughing, sometimes I feel like there's some pain there, but it's not not anything that's too painful.

D: OK, um do you feel like your heart's racing at all?

P: Uh no, not really. 

D: OK. Um have you noticed any swelling in your limbs?

P: No, I didn't notice anything like that.

D: OK, how about um pain in your calves when you walk a few blocks?

P: No, I've been fine that way. 

D: OK. Dizziness or fainting spells?

P: Uh no, not really, I I thought maybe with the shortness of breath that would happen, but like so far that hasn't happened to me.

P: OK, any fevers or chills?

D: Uh no I, maybe like a few chills, like I'm not sure actually, it was hard to tell, but I haven't had any fevers.

P: OK, we'll take your temperature today just to make sure. Um any weight loss over the past few weeks?

D: Uh no, probably weight gain.

P: OK, any changes in your hair, nails, or skin, like rashes? 

P: Uh, no, I haven't noticed anything like that.

D: OK, any changes in your vision or hearing?

P: Uh no, no, that that's all been fine.

D: How about um loss of smell or taste?

P: No, I haven't had uh, I think my taste and smell are still pretty good. No, no issues there.

D: OK, um have you had a runny nose or stuffy nose?

P: No, no, no no congestion really.

D: OK, and um have you had a sore throat at all?

P: No, no sore throat. 

D: OK. Um any issues swallowing food?

P: No.

D: No, changes in your appetite?

P: Maybe just a little bit, like I don't really feel like eating when I'm coughing all the time, but other than that, no, not really.

D: OK. How about nausea or vomiting?

P: No, nothing like that.

D: OK um constipation?

P: No, diarrhea.

D: Diarrhea, right. Um how often are you having a bowel movement right now?

P: I would say uh like I've been going, probably more than eight times a day, probably in the last few days like 10 times a day.

D: Oh wow, OK, and each time are you producing a lot of stool, or is it just a little bit each time?

P: Like a little bit, but it's mostly liquidy.

D: OK. Any solids at all? Like is it semi solid at all?

P: Um maybe a little bit, but mostly it's just liquid.

D: OK, um any blood in the stool?

P: No, I've been checking uh no, I didn't notice any blood or change in colour. It's mainly just um liquid diarrhea.

D: OK, any changes in your urine? 

P: No.

D: No, OK, um any confusion or memory loss?

P: No, not that I know of.

D: OK, um how about muscle aches or joint pains?

P: No, nothing like that.

D: OK, and are you otherwise healthy or do you have any long uh standing medical conditions?

P: Uh, so I do have diabetes and high blood pressure.

D: OK, do you take any medications for those conditions?

P: Yeah, so for diabetes I'm taking this medication called uh like I think metformin and then for the blood pressure, uh I think it's, I forgot the name, I think it's something like um ramipril or something like that.

D: Yep, OK, and you're taking that um as directed, right?

P: Yeah, I've been taking that regularly and my blood pressure, I've been measuring, it's been pretty steady, no changes. 

D: OK, that's good. Have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?

P: I did have my appendix removed, probably in my 20s, but uh that was the only thing. 

D: OK, um and do you have any allergies?

P: No, not not really.

D: OK. Are you up to date with all your immunizations?

P: Yep.

D: OK. Are you on any other medications besides the ramipril and metformin?

P: Just uh like multi vitamins for men over 50.

D: OK, OK. Um any family history of heart conditions or lung conditions that you know of?

P: Um yeah, so my family, like diabetes is pretty big, it runs in the family and uh my father in his 60s uh like died from a heart attack. Um other than that, not anything else I can think of, no.

D: OK, any cancers in their family?

P: Uh no, I don't think so.

D: OK, do you smoke?

P: I used to, I I quit probably five years ago, but before that I used to smoke probably a pack a day for more than 20 years.

D: Oh OK, well good job for cutting down and quitting, um.

P: Yeah.

D: Yeah, um do you do marijuana at all?

P: No, no no no drugs.

D: Any other recreational drugs? You said no, right?

P: Yeah no, no, I don't do any drugs.

D: OK, um do you drink alcohol?

P: Yeah, I probably have maybe um some whiskey maybe a couple times a week.

D: OK. Um and where do you live right now?

P: Uh, so yeah, I just live in the city in London uh in an apartment with my, just wife, my wife.

D: OK, um is she also sick or is she OK?

P: No, she's been completely fine, and I've been kind of isolating myself from her over the last week.

D: OK, well that's good and that's smart, um just because you don't know what you have, right?

P: Mhmm.

D: Yeah OK, do, can you think of any other sick contacts that you may have had over the past one or two weeks or even three weeks?

P: Um I go to the grocery store, then I go to work, I haven't noticed anyone being sick at work, but you know, you never know like who comes in asymptomatic and like they might be carrying it, with this
virus like mainly I'm worried about covid and you know just how fast that's spreading everywhere.

D: Yeah, for sure. Um yeah, for sure, have you traveled to anywhere recently?

P: No, uh we've been in Canada, Ontario, haven't left to go anywhere.

D: OK. OK, well those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or did you have any concerns, anything that you wanted to discuss today?

P: Yeah no, I just uh was wondering if I can get the covid test, that would just, I wanted to make sure I don't give anyone covid if I do have it. 

D: Yeah, for sure, I think that's a good idea. Um so, and it's definitely something that we need to rule out, so we'll do a covid swab today um and you'll hear back within 24 to 48 hours, um but in the mean time, regardless of whether you actually have covid or not, because your symptoms overlap with covid, um it's good to isolate for 14 days and that includes trying to isolate from your wife as well if possible, and public health should be in touch if it's positive uh to do contact tracing. Um and if it's not covid, it's probably another viral illness that's going around at this time of year. Uh if your symptoms get worse, um you know you're having neurological symptoms or or if your fever gets really high, or you're having a lot of trouble breathing, then you should go see the ER. How does that sound?

P: My, if my breathing gets worse uh I'll just go to the emergency Department?

D: Yes, please do. 

P: OK, sounds good.

P: Yeah, I've noticed I've had this pretty bad cough for like the last couple of days. A little bit worried. Wanna talk to someone.

D: OK, so started two days ago.

P: No about what day is it today? Today is Wednesday. It started on Sunday, Sunday. I noticed it getting really bad.

D: OK, so it got really bad. Then it was it was it still present but not as bad before that?

P: Yeah I think I had like a bit of like a raspy cough on like Friday but Sunday it was when I started getting nervous about it.

D: OK so almost a week, it sounds like. And what exactly changed on Sunday that you made it worse in your opinion?

P: So Sunday I started bringing I noticed like little spots of red kind of the the gunk I was bringing up.

D: OK. 

P: And I kind of ignored it, but the next day they were still there. I started getting fever just in I felt off, you know.

D: OK. OK, so that you first notice that on Sunday, were you bringing up sputum before that and it just didn't have these spots or did it, did that part just start on Sunday?

P: Sputum is kind of like the gunk up and bring it up? Yeah, it was. It's like this yellow custard, it’s got like well spots are red on it on Sunday.

D: OK, and before that did you have like the yellow custard without red? Or it all started at once all kind of started?

P: It all started at once to be honest.

D: Sorry, I know these are tricky questions, and you said that you've had some fevers. Can you tell me a little bit about that? When did that start?

P: So that started, the Monday really is when I first started. I never took my temperature. I just felt hot. You know that's been going on pretty much until today.

D: OK, did you ever feel like you were really shaky?

P: Yeah, I've been getting the chills, especially last two days. 

D: OK. So over this time you've had this cough, have you felt like you've had difficulty breathing?

P: Not really, I feel a little bit winded doing things. I used to do like I take the stairs up to my apartment, but I have just happened really trying to exert myself that's been taking it easy so I haven't really noticed being out of breath.

D: OK, so probably if you were to get up and do a lot of physical activity you would feel worse.

P: Yeah, I could, probably I can still take the two stairs up to my apartment, but after that I started to feel pretty crummy.

D: OK. Is there anything else that you can think of that makes it feel worse?

P: No. 

D: Has anything helped it to feel better at all? 

P: Bringing up gunk makes it feel better for a little while.

D: So you kind of just clear it up and that feels a little bit better?

P: Yeah, I haven't taken some Tylenol at home and that helps a little bit. 

D: OK, have you felt a sore throat at the same time?

P: After an awful lot of coughing, yeah, it starts to feel a little raw.

D: Have you had a runny nose?

P: Yeah, bit of 1 back in the day, maybe a week ago, but that kind of gone away by now.

D: Have you felt any chest pain? 

P: Yeah. Yeah I got pain kinda on the right.

D: OK. Have you ever have you ever had anything like this before?

P: No never. Actually Doc, you're saying something that makes it feel worse? Taking a deep breath makes it feel pretty bad.

D: OK, and. I'm just going to circle back to this chest pain. You said you feel it on the right side. Is it always there or is it just when you take a deep breath or is it kind of on and off?

P: It's kind of always there. It gets a little bit worse with coughing and when I take a pretty big deep breath.

D: Yeah, OK, but if you were just laying down, not coughing, is that pain there?

P: Yeah yeah, specially notice over the last day, 

D: OK.

P: Kind of dull.

D: OK. And have you had any weight loss recently? 

P: No, not really.

D: K. Have you traveled anywhere recently?

P: Went to Sarnia. About a week back for work but.

D: OK, were you in contact with anyone that that was sick?

P: Nope, just been keeping to myself mostly.

D: So have you had a lot of exposure to chemicals throughout your career?

Okay, uh, so that, you first noticed that on Sunday, were you bringing up sputum before that and it just didn't have these spots or did it, did that part just, uh, start on Sunday? Sputum's kind of like this yellow custard. It's got like little spots of red on it on Sunday. Okay. And before that, did you have like the yellow custard without red? Or it all started at once? All kind of started at once to be honest. Okay, sorry, these are tricky questions. And you said that you've had some fevers. Can you tell me a little bit about that? When did that start? So that started the Monday, really, it was when I first started. I never took my temperature, I just felt hot, you know? And that's been going on pretty much until today. Okay. Did you ever feel like you were really shaky? Yeah, I've been getting the chills, especially the last two days. Okay. So over this time, you've had this cough. Have you felt like you've had difficulty breathing? Not. I feel a little bit winded doing things I used to do, like I take the stairs up to my apartment, but I just have been really trying to exert myself. It's been taking it easy, so I haven't really noticed being out of breath. No. Okay. So probably if you were to get up and do a lot of physical activity, you would feel worse. Yeah, I could probably, I could still take the two stairs up to my apartment, but after that I start to feel pretty crummy. Okay. Is there anything else that you can think of that makes it feel worse? No. Okay. Has anything helped it to feel better at all? Bringing up Gunk makes it feel better for a little while. Okay, so you kind of just clear it up and that feels a little bit better. Yeah, I've been taking some Tylenol. all at home and that helps a little bit okay have you felt a sore throat at the same time after an awful lot of coughing yeah it starts to feel a little raw okay have you had a runny nose yeah a bit of one back in the like maybe a week ago but that kind of gone away by now okay um have you felt any chest pain yeah yeah it's kind of always there it gets a little bit worse with coughing and when I take a pretty big deep breath yeah okay but if you were just laying down not coughing is that pain there yeah yeah especially noticed over the last day okay kind of dull okay and you had any weight loss recently no not really okay Have you traveled anywhere recently? Went to Sarnia about a week back for work. Were you in contact with anyone that was sick? Nope, just been keeping to myself mostly. Do you have any chronic conditions that you see your family doctor for regularly? Yeah, he's giving me a pill for cholesterol. Is that the only one? Yep. Have you ever had any surgeries? I had my wisdom teeth out as a kid, 15 or so I think. Do you have any allergies? No. Do you live here in town? Yeah. Do you live with your girlfriend? Yeah. Do you have any pets? Yeah, a cat. Do you do anything for work or are you retired? Yeah, I still work. I'm a consultant for chemical plants out west, mainly in Sarnia. Okay. So have you had a lot of exposure to chemicals?

Oh, once in a blue moon. Okay. Do you smoke? Yeah. How much would you say that you smoke? About a pack a day. Okay. And how long has that been going on for?

It could cause your spleen to rupture and sometimes your spleen become very big if you do have mono, but we'll discuss all of that a little bit more after we do uh, the strep test.

P: No.

D: OK. Uh, and uh, and I I know people around your age might experiment with drugs or alcohol. Have you used anything like that or your friends?

P: Yes.

D: OK, yeah. Um alright, so it's sounding like most likely this would be strep throat or, or Group A strep pharyngitis with, because you have no cough, and with a high fever and swelling that you've been redness that you notice in the back of your mouth. And so we'll do a rapid strep antigen test and it will require just a throat swab. To see, to to detect for that, however with a, uh, umm, yeah, I guess that's it. That's what I yeah, well, we'll start with with that now and it could potentially be something like uhm, a viral illness, but that's lower on the on the differential then the bacterial infection is right now. And because of COVID it will be, we'll do a swab as well because people can get fever and sore throat with with COVID as well.

D: OK, OK. Um has he tried anything for it? Have you given him any over the counter medications?

P: Yeah, we we did use some Tylenol and it brought the fever down so that was part of the reason why we we didn't come in 'cause he's had sore throats before but the fever bounced back and and the pain seems to have continued so we came in. 

D: Ok, OK. And is he otherwise healthy? Does he have any medical conditions?

P: Uh, yeah, he's otherwise healthy no medical conditions, um hasn't been, had a reason to see a doctor before. 

D: No, OK. And then just how was pregnancy with him? Was it normal? Any complications?

P: Um yeah there, so had um gestational diabetes, but it was treated, it was treated with diet. Um and blood sugars have been fine now, but no complications to the pregnancy from that regard as far as I know.

D: OK, any alcohol or recreational drugs used during the pregnancy?

P: No, nothing like that. No. No smoking either. 

D: OK, OK, good um and how far along were you when when you delivered him?

P: Um it was a vaginal delivery just after 38 weeks. OK so he was full term.

D: And you said vaginal delivery? Did they have to induce you at all? 

P: Um no no. 

D: OK and was he a normal birth weight? 

P: Yeah he was. Yeah, I think he was like just over 3 kilograms.

D: OK, good and was he healthy after birth? Did he have any breathing issues? Jaundice? Anything like that? 

P: Um, no breathing issues or or jaundice. He came home with us right away.

D: OK, OK and then after that point to now has he been normal in terms of his weight, height, head circumference? 

P: Yeah yeah. He's been growing normally and eating well up up to this point. 

D: OK, and I should ask um has he been hitting all his milestones like, is he doing the things that his peers are doing?

P: Yeah, I would say he's keeping up with his his peers in daycare and no concerns with his development. 

D: OK, good. Is he on any medications? 

P: No medications.

D: No. OK, and is he up to date with all his immunizations?

P: He is yes. 

D: OK, and any allergies?

P: Not that we're aware of.

D: OK, OK Um alright, so it sounds like, um grom what you're telling me, he ohh sorry, I should have asked you this earlier. Has he had any issues breathing?

P: Um no problems breathing, but his voice does sound a bit, a little bit off. A bit Husky. 

D: A bit Husky, OK. Um alright and nothing like a seizure like a febrile seizure, right?

P: No, I haven't seen any like limb jerking or anything like that.

D: OK, so um, just roughly doing from the sounds of it, it sounds like he has a sore throat that's been persistent and we do this thing called the Centor score. So it sounds like he's had a fever, no cough, a sore throat. So the first thing that we want to check to see or to rule out would be a strep throat and then well if that comes back negative we will go from there and think about other viral causes versus strep throat as well. 

D: Did you have any questions or anything that I missed that you wanted to discuss today?

P: Um, no. We were thinking that it could be, uh, maybe strep throat. So um, yeah, thank you.

P: Yeah. 

D: Alright. Any medical conditions that run in your family, anything related to the lungs, or otherwise?

P: Uh, no.

D: OK, uhm, alright, well those are all the questions I had for you. So it sounds like last week you had itchy eyes runny nose, you were sneezing and you had a dry cough. And then over time some of those symptoms resolved and you continued to have a cough that was also getting better, but you then developed a sore throat. And you have been feeling feverish over the past two days. Did you measure, did you check your temperature last week?

P: I didn't check it last week, but I checked it yesterday and it was 38.2, I think. 

D: OK.

P: But yeah, but but those are the symptoms that that I've been having.

D: Uhm, so it sounds like you your symptoms have evolved quite a bit over the past two weeks. It could have, it could be potentially that you had a viral infection initially and might you might have like a superimposed bacterial infection, but we don't know that for sure. Uhm, we, we'll do a physical exam. Have a listen to your chest, have a look inside your mouth, look at your throat. Uhm, we, uhm, I guess the original symptoms you had last week., uhm, were seem a little bit different. It could be pharyngitis, maybe what you have right now could potentially be pharyngitis with a sore throat and the fever that you've developed over the past three or four days. So, I'll definitely have a look inside your throat as well, and if necessary we could do a rapid strep test. Uhm, and we would also have to do a Covid test just in case, and I would recommend that you quarantine at home. The results should come out in the next 12 to 20 for 24 to 48 hours. Just self isolate, stay away from other family members and then you'll find out the results. If it's positive, someone will call you from public health and then let you know what to do.

Just self-isolate, stay away from other family members and then you'll find out the results. If it's positive, someone will call you from public health and then let you know. what to do. Okay yeah that sounds good. All right. Thank you. You're welcome."," What brings you in today? Yeah, I've had the sore throat that's been really bugging me the past four days, and I've had a cough as well. When did the cough start? Yeah, so the cough started last week, actually. uh having any uh difficulties um swallowing at all yeah it's it's uh it's really sore okay um and uh i guess going back to the cop does it make it difficult for you to fall asleep at night or does it wake you up in the middle of the um, like, some itchy eyes that, and, uh, a runny nose. I was sneezing, um, quite a bit last week, um, but that has kind of, uh, gone away now. Mm-hmm. Okay. Um? No, I haven't. Changes in your sense of taste? No. Okay, all right. And any chest pain? No, I haven't had any chest pain. Difficulties breathing? No. Any, I guess, headache or any pressure in your cheeks or your head when you've been down. a few times in the um in the past the last time happened uh about about six months ago um i'm wondering if i have uh strep throat um how often do you get that tantalitis uh so i've had it um four times um yeah four four times in the last few years do you still have your When you were a child or when you were born, were you born prematurely?

Or otherwise? No. Okay. All right. Well, those are the symptoms that I've been having. So it sounds like your symptoms have evolved quite a bit over the past two weeks. It could be potentially that you had a viral infection initially and you might have, like, a superimposed bacterial infection, but we don't know that for sure. If necessary, we could do a rapid strep test. And we would also have to do a COVID test just in case. And I would recommend that you quarantine at home. The results should come out in the next 12 to 24 to 48 hours. Just self-isolate, stay away from other family members. and then you'll find out the results."
RES0055,data/us_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/RES0055.mp3,"D: What brings you in?

P: Hi, yes I just came in today because I've been a bit concerned about some breathing difficulties over the last few days. It all started out with like a cough over the last week, but now I'm having trouble breathing as well.

D: Oh OK, well I'm sorry to hear that. So you said a cough as well, so the cough at least a week back and the shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, when did that start? 

P: So yeah, the cough, I usually have a cough. I've had COPD for a long time, but this past week the coughing has been much worse with a lot of more sputum and. Other than that, it started I would say two to three days ago. The cough got worse and then every time I'm moving around I like have to sit down and catch my breath, which is pretty abnormal for me.

D: OK yeah, so alright. So let's focus on the cough first. You said it's a wet cough?

P: Yes, I am producing a lot of sputum. 

D: OK, what color is your sputum?

P: It's mainly like clear white.

D: OK yeah so you don't see yellow pus or anything green or bloody in there?

P: No, I don't think so. But there's definitely like a lot more than what I usually produce.

D: OK, umm this cough, does it sound harsh, barky or does it sound muffled?

P: I would say it's a bit harsh at times. I wouldn't say it's barky or muffled. I do find myself wheezing a little over the last few days as well. 

D: OK. Do you find you have any chest pain associated with the shortness of breath?

P: Oh no, I don't really have any pains.

D: OK, and have you ever experienced anything like this before?

P: I did a couple of years ago, I had to be admitted because I had some shortness of breath. 

D: OK.

P: But that was, I think, two years ago. 

D: OK. And when you were admitted two years ago, did they tell you what you had?

P: Yeah, they said I had some kind of lung infection at that time, so they gave me some antibiotics while I was in the hospital.

D: OK, did they ever say to you that you had anything else like asthma, COPD, any longstanding conditions?

P: Yeah so I've had COPD for more than... I guess more than 10 years now so I think it just got a lot worse with the infection.

D: OK yeah alright. So this time around, have you had any fevers?

P: I've been having a couple of chills but like they would come and go. I didn't really think it was a fever.

D: OK, any weight loss?

P: No.

D: OK, how about changes in your hair or nails like or or skin like rashes? 

P: Umm, no. 

D: Any changes in your vision or hearing?

P: Nope. 

D: And how about smell or taste?

P: Umm, no. I think they're the same. 

D: OK. Have a stuffy nose or runny nose?

P: I do feel a bit stuffy, but it's not too bad. 

D: OK. And any swelling in your in your legs or upper limbs?

P: No, not that I know.

D: How about calf pain? 

P: Nope.

D: Dizziness or fainting spells?

P: No. 

D: Headaches?

P: No headaches. 

D: Memory loss or confusion?

P: Nope.

D: Changes in your bowel movement or abdominal pain?

P: Nope. 

D: Changes to urinating?

P: No, that's all fine 

D: OK, so besides the COPD, do you have any other longstanding conditions?

P: I do have some high blood pressure which I take, I think I take one of these medications called metoprolol. 

D: OK, and when was the last time you had your blood pressure checked?

P: Umm, probably like a month ago and it was pretty good. I've been checking by myself at home too and it hasn't been changing too much. I think the last one I took was probably like 135 / 80.

D: Oh, I see. OK, any hospitalizations besides the one that you had for COPD a year back?

P: Umm, back when I was a kid I had my tonsils removed.

D: OK, are you on any medications besides the metoprolol? 

P: I do take multivitamins.I think that's yeah, that's about it.

D: Do you take any puffers for your COPD?

P: Yeah, so I do have three like different puffers I take. I can't remember the name. I do have some puffers I don't take. I've been using them right now. It has been helping with some of my shortness of breath, but I've definitely been having to use them way more than I used to.

D: OK. Do you know which puffer you're on?

P: Yeah, so I think one of them is called ventolin. OK, and then I think the second one is called the Spiriva.

D: OK, sure, Yep.

P: So one of them should be a short acting beta agonist.

D: Just wanna make sure that you have one with a long acting and then the other one is a long acting beta agonist. OK, good. Alright, are you up to date with all your immunizations?

P: Yeah, I think so.

D: And are you allergic to anything?

P: No, not that I know.

D: Any family history of lung conditions?

P: Umm, no I don't think so. Yeah, no, I don't think so.

D: OK. How about heart conditions?

P: Yeah, my father died of a heart attack in his 60s. 

D: OK. Alright, any cancers?

P: My uncle had skin cancer. 

D: OK. Do you know what type of skin cancer like melanoma, basal cell, squamous cell?

P: No, I think it wasn't the bad one. It was like the one they can remove right away.

D: Oh I see. OK, OK, that's good.Do you smoke?

P: Yeah, I've been smoking for around, I would say the last 20 years.

D: OK, how much do you smoke?

P: Probably I would say pack a day for the last 20 years.

D: Umm, have you ever thought about quitting?

P: Yeah I did. I did once and then went back onto it. I definitely do smoke less than before though. OK, but yeah, I don't think I'm ready to quit yet.

D: OK, yeah no problem. Do you drink alcohol? 

P: Umm, yeah, maybe once a week I would have a small Cup of whiskey.

D: OK, sure, that's fine. And any other drugs?

P: No, no marijuana, no other drugs.

D: OK, and where do you live right now?

P: Right now I live in a small bungalow in London. 

D: OK, any reasons to believe there are carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, anything that could be triggering your COPD?

P: Umm, I don't think so. Everything is pretty up to date.

D: OK, have you had any contact with anyone that's been sick recently?

P: No, I've been mostly trying to isolate and like just be in my own home. 

D: OK, how about travel to anywhere?

P: Nope, I've been in Ontario since the beginning of the pandemic.

D: Yeah OK, that makes sense. Well, those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?

P: Yeah, I was just worried if it can be COVID or if it's just like another infection that I had like before.

D: Yeah, so we're definitely going to do a COVID swab on you and those results should take about 24 to 48 hours to come back to you. And in the meantime, because your symptoms do overlap with COVID, you should isolate for 14 days. Public health will be in touch with you if it's positive to do some contact tracing. If it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection that's been going around during this time of year which is likely because you have COPD, since you're already coughing more than you usually are and seeing more sputum. We will reassess to see whether your puffers are working. If we need to add any additional things like inhaled corticosteroids as well as antibiotics and so just keep an eye on your symptoms for now and will also want to do probably a chest X Ray and possibly a pulmonary function test. How does that sound?

P: I'm just bringing my son today because he's been how many episodes where I'm eat hell gets all this coughing fit and become wheezy and become shorter breath and I mean after a period of time it goes away, but it's been happening every so often.

D: Does he still have these symptoms?

P: Like right now he's OK. When the symptoms come on, they last for I don't know, maybe 30 minutes, 60 minutes or or even less. But yeah it happens maybe once or twice a week where and it's been going on for a, a couple of months now. Yeah, he actually had a viral infection like a few months ago and I thought it was just that. It leared up and then he's just had a few more of these episodes, but without those kind of symptoms so.

D: Hm? So all this started a couple months ago.

P: Yeah. 

D: Do you find that there and you mentioned that it happens about one to two times a week? Is there anything specific happening at that time? Any triggers that result in these symptoms?

P: Well I will say I think I like exercise. I find yeah like soccer practice. Yeah, after maybe, or even during a game, like when things are really intense. Yeah, I think during soccer I've I've kind of noticed it. And then at night time as well. It kind of randomly, he'll have this cough.

D: OK. So I guess it's do you feel like it's affected by cold weather as well or no?

P: Um, maybe yeah, like if he yeah completely in the winter time. Like I know when he goes outside if he yeah he takes like a deep breath or something like that. He'll talk about having shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in the cold weather. 

D: OK, other than the and I guess the cough. Is he coughing up anything, or is it kind of a dry cough?

P: It's dry.

D: OK. Does he have any like chest pain during these episodes.

P: No, he hasn't said anything like that.

D: Alright, any fevers?

P: No, he had a little bit of a fever at the that one time a few months ago, but he hasn't. So that's right. I think he had a some sort of illness then, but he hasn't had any fevers.

D: I see. OK, any headaches?

P: No, he hasn't said anything like that. 

D: OK. And how has he had any other symptoms so anything like racing heart or belly pain or muscle aches or any changes in his bowel movements or urinary symptoms? 

P: Uh no, I haven't heard him, uh, I complain about anything like that. I think I'll everything like that's been normal. 

D: OK. So when he has these episodes, how like how severe are they? So how difficult is it for him to breathe?

P: Ah, well, you certainly when it first starts, I mean for the first minute or two. Yeah, he that when I think particularly at soccer practice school have a really hard time catching his breath, but like he would, he stops playing and rests and really tries to make sure that he is I don't know, just trying to to breathe and it kind of goes away. He's been able to manage it OK.

D: OK, alright and I have these symptoms that have interfered with his daily activities? Does he for instance, try to avoid soccer practice. Or does he have difficulties falling asleep at night?

P: Yeah, definitely wakes him up a few and every once in awhile at night and he does have to take it a little easier at soccer for sure. So yeah, I am thinking it is affecting him.

D: OK. And otherwise has he been, has he had any medical conditions that he's been diagnosed with?

P: Uh, no, well he had some rashes when he was younger that he would get some some creams for, but that's mostly resolved now.

D: OK, any hospitalizations or surgeries?

P: No, he hasn't had anything like that.

D: OK, uhm. And just going back to his birth and your pregnancy, were there any complications at the time of pregnancy? 

P: Um, there was a prolonged labor, I think, but he was delivered vaginally and at term 

D: OK. OK, that's great.

P: And he, oh sorry, I was just going to say normal weight as well. 

D: OK good has, was he kept in the in ICU for a couple of days after, was he sent home?

P: I think they, like he was kept for not an ICU he was kept for one day I think so just monitor for infection because it was like prolonged labor but he was OK. OK, so yeah we were able to go home.

D: OK, and I, what was I going to say. Forgot what I was going to say. How yeah, how has this growth and development been? Has he been seeing his doctor regularly? Any concerns there? 

P: Yeah he's been good with with growth. No concerns for that and his developments been normal as well. He's reached all of his milestones.

D: OK, and is he going to school?

P: Yeah, yeah, he's been going to school. He hasn't really been, he hasn't missed well he's missed one or two days actually, because of the cough, like on nights that he just didn't sleep well, so in the morning he's just well, not not feeling good for school so he has missed a couple of days over the last few months.

D: Okay. And does he, is there any other any conditions that run in the family? Including things like asthma or eczema, or allergic rhinitis or allergies.

P: Yeah, sister does have some bad allergies. Her nose runs all the time and she also has that asthma. His sister uses and a daily inhaler and then also W1. 

D: I see. OK, and uh. How are things at home is he, is he doing well otherwise? Like at school and things like that, any stressors in his life?

P: No, he's been doing, uh, he's been doing well at school. He likes math and that that's been going, well. 

D: OK, great. Has he ever tried any puffers?

P: No, he hasn't actually. 

D: Has he been on any medications?

P: Um, he he has not. 

D: Any allergies that he has?

P: Not that I'm aware of, but I I think he might. I mean so like environmental or I don't know, something. He does get symptoms like a runny nose and itchy eyes sometimes, but usually go away pretty pretty quickly and he doesn't fuss about it too much so, yeah so. 

D: From the symptoms that you've described so far, it sounds like he might also have asthma, but we will obviously have to do some testing and confirm that. Uhm, and also, it's given sort of the results, or even just like giving his symptoms, prescribe some buffers to help with those symptoms. Clearly it's affecting his life. He can't go to school or can't participate in soccer, or sometimes wakes up in the middle of the night, and that's not good. So, we'll we can be prescribed some puffers and see if those help and also get some testing done. Do you have any other questions for me? 

P: Uhm, No, yeah I was just wondering about, so like the wheezing and all of that could be with from asthma too?

D: Uhm, yeah, I would think so, but again, we'll get the testing done and see if there are any other, any other causes.

P: Ok.

D: You said the wheezing sort of lasts only 30 to 30 minutes to an hour and then gets better?

P: Yeah, I don't notice that any other times.

D: Yes, it's possibly, I mean, I would think it's asthma, but then we'll get the testing done and see.

RES0216,data/us_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/RES0216.mp3,"D: So I understand you're having some chest tightness?

P: Yeah, it's uh, for the last maybe three days, um it's not really pain, not in any specific spot, it just feels a bit tight in my chest area when I breathe in especially, and it just gets a bit harder to breathe and it feels more tight like especially when I go for my walks, which I do everyday, uh I try to walk my dog. So I was just, you know, worried that it could be something serious and I wanted to come and get checked out.

D: OK, for sure. So you said it started about 3 days ago. Have you noticed it's been getting better, worse or about staying the same?

P: I think it's staying the same.

D: OK, was there anything that happened 3 days ago that you can recall where you first noticed it?

P: No, nothing in particular um yeah, it just kind of came on and now it's been pretty steady.

D: OK and when it came on three days ago, what were you doing?

P: Uh I think I first noticed it when I was gone for my walk.

D: OK, now when you're walking, you say you have some chest tightness, do you have any chest pain? 

P: No, there's not there's not pain, it just feels like, when I breathe in it feels tight.

D: OK, did you feel anxious or sweaty or the feeling of impending doom at all? 

P: Uh, no I can't say that I did.

D: Nothing like that, OK, and did you feel yourself becoming out of breath at all?

P: Uh I I feel like it was kind of harder to get a whole breath, um so yeah, yeah, I guess.

D: OK, and was this tightness all across your chest or was it in one particular area?

P: Kind of just all over. 

D: OK. And since then, that happened when you were out for a walk, how many times does it happen a day would you say? 

P: Well, I feel like it's kind of always there, but it gets worse when I go for my walk. Um and well sometimes I go for more than one walk, right, 'cause I walk my dog. It's always kind of there, and especially when I'm like getting up out of the chair, I can feel it more, or when I take a big like a big breath in, as I said.

D: OK, so it's been there pretty constantly for the past three days, but it's more noticeable, if not worse, when you're going for a walk?

P: Exactly.

D: OK. Have you had any cough at all in the last little while?

P: Uh no like I feel a little more hoarse and like there's maybe some more phlegm, like I'm clearing my throat more, but I haven't actually been coughing.

D: OK, any fevers? 

P: No, can't say that, no.

D: OK, any night sweats, so waking up and the sheets are soaked?

P: No.

D: Any chills?

P: No.

D: Any unexplained weight loss at all?

P: Nope.

D: OK, and have you ever had anything like this happen to you before?

P: Uhm, I mean I have asthma um so I've had some trouble breathing before, it, this feels feels uh different than other times. I I guess it could be related, but uh I don't know, this this feels a bit different, that's why I wanted to come in and get it checked out.

D: OK, so you have asthma, do you use any puffers at the moment?

P: Yeah, I just use the one that um I take every day. I don't really use the uhm, the one thats as needed because I just haven't had to in a really long time so I didn't refill my last one.

D: OK, so you don't have any anymore of the as needed, but you have used it in the past?

P: Yeah, exactly like it's been a couple of years since I needed that, but I still I still take the daily one.

D: OK. And you haven't stopped taking the daily one in last three days either?

P: No, I always take it um so I'm supposed to actually take it morning and night, um for a while though sometimes I was skipping the night one because I didn't feel that I was needing it. Um so so lately I've been taking it everyday, but I've just been taking it in the morning.

D: OK, uh, what makes you say you haven't really needed the one at night? Have you just been doing well without it?

P: Exactly, like I haven't needed the rescue one in a few years and even when I was just taking it in the morning, I I haven't had any problems.

D: OK, understood. And then have you had, I should have asked, do you work currently?

P: Uh I I, I'm a financial advisor, I'm like semi retired so I do some stuff from home.

D: OK, got it. I suppose just, has this kind of chest tightness stopped you from doing activities that you normally would do, any missed time from work?

P: I haven't missed any work, but I'm not I'm not doing a ton of work right now. I don't think it would stop me, it just would make me uncomfortable um during work and it keeps me, maybe this, the last few days, it's kept me from, I usually go on a couple of walks a day, the last couple days I've just gone on one usually so yeah, it's a little bit, yeah.

D: So it's really not stopping too much of your day to day functioning, but it's noticeable?

P: Exactly, yeah.

D: OK. Now, is there any other issue that you see your doctor regularly for aside from the asthma?

P: Uhm, I have uh high blood pressure, I don't really see my doctor very much, I just am on um medication.

D: OK, how about we just talk about your medications a little bit? What are you taking currently?

P: Uh I take the, uh, salbutamol.

D: Yeah.

P: That we talked about, and I take um Ramipril.

D: Yep.

P: And, uh, sometimes a Tylenol if you know, if I have a headache or something, but not very often.

D: OK understood, so aside from the high blood pressure you're really not taking medications for much else?

P: No, no.

D: OK. Do you have any other lung issues or any trouble with your lungs in the past?

P: No, nothing major, just the asthma. But you know, like I said, it's been a few years since it has bothered me.

D: OK, got it, and just in terms of your life itself, so do you smoke at all?

P: No, never.

D: OK, so no smoking, any other recreational substances, drugs?

P: Oh no, no. I mean I I have um you know a few beers on the weekend, but I don't do very, I don't do any drugs and I don't drink much other than that.

D: OK, got it. Any allergies that you have?

P: Uhm no, no, like I, uh, when I was younger I got some seasonal allergies sometimes in the springtime, but other than that, I I like I, it's really been uh many years since I've noticed that.

D: OK, and so nothing new in the environment? You haven't changed where you've been living or you haven't introduced a new pet or a new dog?

P: Exactly.

D: OK, so sounds like you're pretty much staying the course last little while, just kind of a new onset of this new chest tightness, and aside from that, seems that it comes on mainly on walks outdoors, but you've kind of been limiting the, some of the medication you're taking for asthma the last couple of years because you haven't really felt that you needed it as much. 

P: Yeah, like just the morning was, it was enough.

D: OK. Alright John, I think I've got most of the information I need just to go talk to the doc and talk about your story. Next of course we're going to do a quick physical exam, going to take a listen to your lungs and see what else we might want to do in terms of investigations. I have a feeling that this actually might be your asthma reoccurring in some capacity or that would be on the top of the differential for now, barring any other new findings. So I think maybe what we would like to do is, we'd like to try having those rescue puffers available to see if that helps at all when you are on walks, and if they don't help, then we'll come back to the table and see what other possible directions we could head in in order to help you next. Does that sound good John?

P: Sounds great, I'm just, you know, glad to know that it's probably not my heart.

D: No, it sounds well, I suppose you said that you didn't really get out of breath with exercise, more sounds like a chest tightness, and you haven't had any pain associated with it, so that puts more cardiac ischemic pictures kind of lower on the differential. But of course we're going to try one thing at a time, and then we'll come back to the table um depending on how you're feeling after that, OK?

P: Sounds great, thank you.

D: No problem. OK, I'll go talk to the doctor, I'll be back with you in a moment.

P: Thank you.",627.647125,us_medical,"So understanding you're having some chest tightness? Yeah, it's for the last maybe three days. It's not really pain, not in any specific spot.

How long have you been on medication? Okay. How long have you been on medication? It's really been many years since I've noticed that. Okay. And so nothing new in the environment. You haven't changed where you've been living or you haven't introduced a new pet or a new dog. Exactly. Okay. So it sounds like you pretty much stayed the course last a little while. Just kind of a new onset of this new chest tightness. And aside from that, it seems that it comes on mainly on walks outdoors. You've kind of been limiting some of the medication you've been taking for asthma the last couple of years because you haven't really felt that you needed it as much. Yeah. Just the morning was, it was enough. Okay. All right, John, I think I've got most of the information I need just to go talk to the doc and talk about your story. Next, of course, we're going to do a quick physical exam. I'm going to take a listen to your lungs and see what else we might want to do in terms of investigations. I have a feeling that this actually might be your asthma reoccurring in some capacity or that would be on the top of the differential for now, barring any new findings. So I think maybe we would like to try having those rescue puffs available to see if that helps at all when you are on walks. And if they don't help, then we'll come back to the table and see what other possible directions we could head in order to help you next. Does that sound good, John? That sounds great. I'm just, you know, glad to know that it's probably not my heart. No, it sounds well, I suppose you said that you didn't really get out of breath with exercise more. sounds like a chest tightness and you haven't had any pain associated with it so that puts more cardiac ischemic pictures kind of lower on the differential but of course we're going to try one thing at a time and then we'll come back to the table depending on how you're feeling after that. Okay? Sounds great. Thank you. No problem. Okay, I'll go talk to the doctor and I'll be back with you in a moment. Thank you."," So I understand you're having some chest tightness. Yeah, for the last maybe three days, it's not really pain, not in any specific spot. It just feels a bit tight in my chest area when I breathe in, especially. And it just gets a bit harder to breathe, and it feels more tight, like especially when I go on three days ago, what were you doing? I think I first noticed it when I was gone for my walk. Okay. Now, when you're walking, you say you have some chest noises. Do you have any chest pain? No, there's not pain. It just feels like when I breathe in, it feels tight. Okay. Since then, that happened when you were up for a walk. How many times does it happen a day, would you say? Well, I feel like it's kind of always there, but it gets worse when I go for my walk. And, well, sometimes I go for more than one walk, right, because I walk my dog. But it's always kind of there, and especially when I'm, like this happen to you before um i mean i have asthma um so I'm supposed to actually take it morning and night um for a while though sometimes I was skipping the night one because I didn't feel that I was needing it. home. Okay, got it. I suppose just has this kind of chest tightness stopped you from doing activities that you normally would do? Any missed time from work? I haven't missed any work, but I'm not doing a ton of work right now. I don't think it would stop me. It just would make me uncomfortable during work. And it keeps me maybe this, the last few. on um medication okay how about we just talk about your medications a little bit what are you taking currently uh i take the salbutamol yeah that we talked about and uh i take um remapro yep and uh sometimes the tylenol if you know if a few beers on the weekend, but I don't do very, I don't do any drugs and I don't drink much other than that. Okay, got it. Any allergies you have? No much yeah like just the morning was it was enough okay all right john i think i've got most of the information i need just to go talk to the doc and talk about your story next of course we're going to do a quick physical exam we're going to take a listen to your lungs and see what else we might want to do in terms of investigations I have a feeling that this actually might be your..."

P: I am.

D: OK and. Could you tell me about your partners or partner?

P: No.

D: OK. And any a musculoskeletal or neurological conditions that run in the family?

P: No.

D: OK, and how about any cancers that run in the family?

P: No cancers that I know of.

D: OK, and how about heart conditions or or lung conditions?

P: No, nothing like that. 

D: OK, so next. Just wanted to move on to their physical exam piece of the appointment today, so just looking at your um, the, at your feet and at the joints of the ankle and toes are you seeing any swelling, redness, or yeah, any swelling or redness?

P: Um no no swelling or redness.

D: All right, are there is there a temperature change to your feet or any of the joints? Are they feeling hot or cold? 

P: No. 

D: OK. And is there any deformities or misalignment of any of the joints? 

P: No.

D: OK, and any scarring from any of the trauma?

P: Uhm, there are like. Yeah, there's some scarring from like ulcers.

D: From previous ones that have that have healed? 

P: Healed. Yeah, that's right.

D: OK, and. And is there any pain to palpation over the um ankle joint, over the ankle joint?

P: No.

D: OK, then how about over any of the joints of your toes?

P: Um no not nothing like that. No pain, just um I can't feel it.

D: OK. And how is the range of motion of your feet and toes?

P: Um pretty good. I can move them all.

D: OK, and then how about your knees?

P: My knees are also the same.

D: OK, uh, an any ankle like instability with any special tests?

P: No

D: OK, and and on walking is there any limp or does it appear, how does the walk appear?

P: I'm pretty normal. I'm not limping.

D: OK. And. OK, so that was everything that I wanted to ask and and check today. Did you have any questions?

P: Just what do you think is going on with my feet and how do I get some sensation back?

D: So it does sound like it could be related to diabetes where what happens is you get like a peripheral neuropathy overtime and you can lose sensation to your feet in a glove and stocking distribution, which sounds like the history history you're saying today with having sensation reduced on your feet and also your fingertips as well. 

P: Mmmm

D: Where you lose sensation and you can't feel pain. And so But other things to consider could be. Possibly like vitamin deficiencies or things like that, but I would be much much lower down on the differential. And. So to regain sensation I think. Really, the only thing that can be done now is to help prevent further damage to the nerves, and that would be to make sure that the diabetes is under good control and. Trying to monitor your feet as regularly as you can, making sure that the. There aren't any kind of open wounds or sores that are are not healing. If things are not healing, it will be important to check to see if there is an underlying infection such as osteomyelitis, which will prevent wound healing. And so if there are any, is anything like that it would be important to have that checked out. So feet hygiene is extremely important. As we're working on improving the diabetes control as well as things like cutting down alcohol could could also help as well.

RES0005,data/us_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/RES0005.mp3,"D: I was wondering if you could tell us what brought you in to see us.

P: Yeah, so I just came in. I was a bit worried because I've been having this cough for around two years, which has been getting worse. But recently I've noticed that I see streaks of blood in the sputum that I'm producing. Before it just used to be like white but now I'm seeing over the last, I would say two months occasionally some streaks of blood.

D: OK, and the cough started two years ago.

P: Yeah.

D: OK. And, it's been gradually getting worse over that time?

P: Yeah, I would say so. It's getting more frequent and worse in nature.

D: OK. And how much sputum are you bringing up an in a day?

P: Probably like a, a couple teaspoons. 

D: OK, and uh, is are you seeing like bright red blood when you're when you're coughing it up?

P: Uh. In this it's kind of mixed into the sputum. I would say like, but it definitely is red.

D: OK. And how much blood would you say that you're you're bringing up would be teaspoons? Or a Cup? Or?

P: No. It's just like a little streaks. It's not really significant, it doesn't feel like the whole production of the sputum, but just like little streaks that I've noticed.

D: OK and um is the cough worse, at any particular time of day?

P: Um, it definitely gets worse when I'm doing more activities and then also when I get like some viral infections. But other than that, it's pretty much always there. 

D: OK, anything that that makes it worse? You said some viral infections. Have you had a viral infection recently?

P: Yeah, like in the last two years, I've probably had two or three viral infections, just just just cold cold symptoms.

D: Has there been anything that you've tried to make the cough better?

P: I've tried the Tylenol Cold, hasn't really worked. Tried just other over the counter medications, haven't really worked. 

D: OK. And prior to two years ago um, were you experiencing any similar symptoms like, uh, like this cough or bringing up blood before? 

P: In the past, I've always had a somewhat of a cough like I have COPD. So I've always had a little bit of a cough here and there, but over the last two years I feel that it's been getting much worse. 

D: OK, have you been diagnosed with chronic bronchitis before?

P: Yeah I think so.

D: OK. Um and so with with this cough and now blood tinged sputum, have you been experiencing any other symptoms?

P: Um, I do feel sometimes I get like more tired than I used to throughout the day.

D: OK.

P: Um, sometimes I also feel more breathless on when I'm exerting myself more.

D: OK, and have you been having any fevers or chills?

P: No, no I haven't.

D: How about any night sweats?

P: No.

D: Have you lost any weight?

P: Yeah, I've actually lost a significant amount of weight. I would say within the last 1 and a 1/2 months probably lost like 8 to 10 pounds. 

D: OK, have you been trying to lose weight?

P: No, not really I've just been sitting around like I can barely walk that much anymore too. I used to be able to walk at least 400 meters around the block, but now I can barely even go to the kitchen. 

D: OK, is this because of the shortness of breath when you are are exerting? 

P: Yeah, that and I just start coughing so much that I just have to sit down.

D: OK. Um, and have you been having any headaches?

P: No headaches.

D: Alright, and how about and how is your appetite been?

P: Um, I think it's been pretty much the same. Sometimes when I'm coughing a lot, I don't feel like eating, but other than that it's been around the same.

D: OK, any nausea or vomiting?

P: No. 

D: Any runny nose or sore throat?

P: No.

D: OK. And then how about a loss of smell or a loss of taste? 

P: No, nothing like that.

D: OK, have you been having any chest pain?

P: No. 

D: Any heart palpitations? 

P: Nope.

D: Any wheezing when you're breathing?

P: Sometimes I would say like when when, it gets worse when I'm exerting myself more, I I can get some wheezing. 

D: OK, and have you noticed any swelling in your feet or ankles?

P: No, nothing like that. 

D: Alright. And have you woken up at night extremely short of breath?

P: No, I'm pretty fine during the night. 

D: Alright And, uh, have you been having any abdominal pain?

P: No.

D: Any urinary problems?

P: Uh no. 

D: Any bowel problems like diarrhea or constipation?

P: No, nothing like that. 

D: Alright, any skin rashes?

P: Nope.

D: Any joint pains or or muscle pains?

P: No.

D: Any weakness?

P: Not weakness, I'll just say more fatigue. 

D: Alright so I know you told me a COPD, but do you have any other medical diagnosis? 

P: Yeah, I have high blood pressure as well. 

D: Alright.

P: I think I have high cholesterol too.

D: I see, OK. Do you take any medications regularly?

P: Yeah, so for the cholesterol taking Rosuvastatin and I forget what I'm taking for the blood pressure, but it's pretty well under control.

D: OK, do you use any inhalers for COPD?

P: I used to. I used to have I think like 3 different inhalers but haven't had to use them for more than 10 years now.

D: OK, and what was the reason for not needing them anymore? 

P: I just didn't have any symptoms for a pretty long time and my doc said like if I don't really need them then I could just stop.

D: OK, and have you had any recent hospitalizations? 

P: No.

D: Any allergies to medications?

P: Nope. 

D: Any surgeries that you had in the past?

P: No surgeries. 

D: OK, And are your vaccinations up to date?

P: Yup. 

D: OK, and could you tell me a little bit about your social situation or living situation?

P: Yeah, so currently I'm just living by myself in an apartment. I've been there for more than 10 years now. Um, I am retired so I'm not working anymore. But yeah, that's that's me.

D: OK, great um. What did you do previously for for work? Did you have any exposures for two chemicals or dusts or asbestos? Things like of that nature?

P: Oh yes, I worked in the steel factory for most of my working life. I think yeah, there might have been some exposures to chemicals and dust particles. Asbestos I don't think there was exposure, but definitely I may have lived in places that had asbestos. I mean, yeah.

D: OK, how long have you been living where you you've been now?

P: So this this is like the one I'm living in is a new place, but before that, I lived in another apartment for around five years and that was a pretty old building.

D: OK, do you have any pets?

P: No pets, no.

D: OK um. And do you smoke cigarettes?

P: Yeah, I smoke, I'd say around 20 cigarettes a day right now.

D: Alright, and did you smoke more previously?

P: Yeah, I think I've been smoking for almost like 40 years now and I used to smoke up to 30 cigarettes a day. 

D: OK, do you smoke cannabis?

P: No. 

D: Alright. Do you drink alcohol?

P: Um just maybe a couple times a month. Nothing, nothing throughout the week.

D: OK, so do you use any recreational drugs like IV drugs or opioids or cocaine? 

P: No, nothing like that.

D: Alright. And anybody in the family have any similar symptoms before like coughing up blood or?

P: No. Not that I know of. My father passed away from a heart attack when he was in his 60s. And I think my mother had a, um like I think one of the like, an arthritis. But yeah, like, but I think that was just like the one that you get with old age.

D: OK, like osteoarthritis? 

P: Yeah that that was the one.

D: OK. Any cancers in the family?

P: Um, not that, one of my uncles had like um bladder cancer, but that's that's that's about it.

D: OK, and have you have you traveled anywhere recently or been around any sick contacts? Possibly people anybody who's had tuberculosis or any infections?

P: No, I've been pretty much to myself over the last few months, so not really.

D: OK um. Was there anything that you're worried that this could be?

P: Um Yeah, just the blood I kind of got scared maybe I thought like you know what if it's a cancer? One of my friends had lung cancer and I I know I've been smoking for most of my life, so that's something I was worried about.

D: Um, I can certainly see that the concern and I understand where you're coming from. I think it would be very reasonable to investigate that today. So we'll start with a chest CT along with some lab work and we will get a CBC and some electrolytes, also get an ECG as well to just check your heart and we will see what what the investigations show

P: Sounds good. 

D: OK, and um, other things that um to think about this could be, uh, also like to COPD I know it's been going on a long time, but possibly could have a pneumonia that's been lingering on, particularly if it's a fungal type of infection and as well as things like you mentioned you possibly unsure if you've had an asbestos exposure in the past and stuff like that can possibly lead to scarring of the lung, and so all of these factors will be looked into.

P: OK, sounds good. Thank you so much. 

D: Alright, you're welcome, thank you.",821.6769375,us_medical,"I was wondering if you could tell us what brought you in to see us. Yeah, so I just came in. I was a bit worried because I've been having this cough for around two years, which has been getting worse. But recently I've noticed that I see streaks of blood in the sputum that I'm producing. Before it just used to be like white, but now I'm seeing over the last, I would say two months, occasionally some streaks of blood. Okay. And the cough started two years ago? Yeah. Okay. And it's been gradually getting worse over that time? Yeah, I would say so. It's getting more frequent and worse in nature. Okay. And how much sputum are you bringing up in a day? Probably like a couple of teaspoons. Okay. And are you seeing like bright red blood when you're coughing it up? In this, it's kind of mixed into the sputum, I would say, but it definitely is red. Okay. And how much blood would you say that you're bringing up? Would it be teaspoons or a cup or? No, it's just like little streaks. It's not really significant. It doesn't feel like the whole production of the sputum, but just like little streaks that I've noticed. Okay. And, um, Is the cough worse at any particular time of day? It definitely gets worse when I'm doing more activities and then also when I get like some viral infections. But other than that, it's pretty much always there. Okay. Anything that makes it worse? I used to say some viral infections. Have you had a viral infection recently? Yeah, like in the last two years I've probably had two or three viral infections. Just cold symptoms. Has there been anything that you've tried to make the cough better? I've tried Tylenol cold. It hasn't really worked. Tried just other over-the-counter medications. Haven't really worked. Okay. And prior to two years ago, were you experiencing any similar symptoms like this cough or bringing up blood before in the past? I've always had somewhat of a cough. Like I have COPD. So I've always had a little bit of a cough here and there, but over the last two years I feel that it's been getting much worse. Okay. Have you been diagnosed? Do you have any other symptoms? I do feel that sometimes I get more tired than I used to throughout the day. Sometimes I also feel more breathless on when I'm exerting myself more. Have you been having any fevers or chills? No, no I haven't. Have you been having any night sweats? No. Have you lost any weight? Yeah, I've actually lost a significant amount of weight. I would say within the last one and a half month, I probably lost like 8 to 10 pounds. Have you been trying to lose weight? No, not really. I've just been sitting around. I can barely walk that much anymore. I used to be able to walk at least 400 meters around the block, but now I can barely even go to the kitchen. Is this because of the shortness of breath when you are exerting? Yeah, that and I just start coughing so much that I just have to sit down. Okay. And have you been having any headaches? No headaches. Alright. And how about and how has your appetite been? I think it's been pretty much the same sometimes when I'm coughing a lot I don't feel like eating but other than that it's been around the same. Okay. Any nausea or vomiting? No. Any runny nose or sore throat? Nope. Okay. And then how about a loss of smell or a loss of taste? No, nothing like that. Okay. Have you been having any chest pain? No. Any heart palpitations? No. Any wheezing when you're breathing? Sometimes, I would say like when when it gets worse when I'm exerting myself more I can get some wheezing. Okay.

Any abdominal pain? No. Any urinary problems? No. Any bowel problems like diarrhea or constipation? No, nothing like that. Any skin rashes? No. Any joint pains or muscle pains? No. Any weakness? No weakness, I would just say more fatigue. Alright, so I know you told me COPD, but do you have any other medical diagnoses? Yeah, I have high blood pressure as well. I think I have high cholesterol too. I see. Okay. Do you take any medications regularly? Yeah, so for the cholesterol, I'm taking Rosuvastatin. And I forget what I'm taking for the blood pressure, but it's pretty well under control. Okay. Do you use any inhalers for COPD?

D: OK. Um I think those are all the questions that I had for you, um did you have any questions of your own for myself?

P: Uh no, I was just wondering what this pain could be on my, in my elbow. 

D: Yeah, so right now it seems like you may have a case of something called um lateral epicondylitis. So, it's also known as uh tennis elbow, um and there are a lot of things that could kind of predispose you to this, um so it could be like the repetitive strain at work, um and like continuous contraction of your wrist extensor muscle group there. Um so for this we basically recommend um a couple of things to manage the pain. Uh but first, like in terms of imaging, I don't think it is necessary because it doesn't seem like there was any trauma and I'm not too worried about any fractures. Um so to help you treat this, um we recommend some activity modifications, so um at work not doing things that are too repetitive, especially if it's using those um extensor forearm muscles. Um and then you can use some, use a compression sleeve as well, continue taking Tylenol or NSAIDs for the pain and uh really important is physical therapy um to increase mobility and strength in that arm. Uh and as well you can apply things like ice um to it for like the pain and swelling if you see any. Uh, yeah, so it should resolve in about six months to two years at most, uh but normally it does um go away in a couple of months with some physical therapy and the compression and splints if you choose to do that. How does that sound?

D: OK, and has that been working for you at all?

P: A little bit I think.

D: OK. OK, so those are some of the questions I had. And I'm just gonna ask a few questions about just examining the areas that are giving you trouble. So along your back, if you if you were to press down on from the middle to your lower back, any kind of pain when you press down.

P: Um lower back, yes.

D: OK, So what kind of pain is it like sharp or is it kind of a dull aching pain?

P: When I press down it feels sharp.

D: OK, and do you have you notice any kind of swelling in your legs or, near the areas where you have pain swelling or redness, or  any warmth?

P: Um it seems to. Actually, no, it's not. It's not warm.

D: OK. And in terms of just movement, are you able to bend down?

P: I can bend down, it's just hard for me to get back up.

D: OK See and how about like bend sideways.

P: I can do that.

D: OK nd how about if you're laying flat are you able to raise your legs without bending your knees?

P: I can do that, yeah, actually no. I can't. Sorry that that hurts.

D: So your right leg hurts when you do that? 

P: Yeah

D: OK, great. And other than that, like when you when you do any of those movements, can you, do you get like that tingling again?

P: Yeah it does. Yeah.

D: OK alright and when you stand up and walk how would you describe, are you having any kind of limping at all?

P: Um a little bit of limp yeah,  I'm putting more weight on the left leg.

D: OK, alright, so yeah, those are just some of the questions I I had for you today. Do you have any questions at all?

P: Um no, what can I do about this back pain and how long do you think I'll have it for? 

D: Yeah, so it's been happening for one month right and you're getting some symptoms in in your lower leg, so normally we would wait before we do any kind of diagnostic imaging. But since you're also having these other symptoms we we were worrying about sometimes lower back pain can lead to something called sciatica. It's just when one of the nerves get pinched, and then that's why you're getting the tingling around your right upper leg. So what we can do is. We can do if you haven't had an X Ray, we can do an X Ray of your lower back. And then we can also do an MRI. 

P: OK 

D: And. Based on what results come back at the same time we will, I will give you some information about some anti- inflammatory medications you could take to help relieve some of your pain, but other than that I will also refer you to some physiotherapy. That will help you do some exercises at home. Just ways to protect your back as well as strengthen some of your muscles to help deal with some of that pain. Yeah, so we'll get the results back. And then we'll go from there.

P: OK, sounds good. Thank you.

RES0075,data/us_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/RES0075.mp3,"D: What brought you in today?

P: Yeah, so uh, just randomly like 2 days ago I just started having this chest pain when I'm breathing and it's just been getting worse and then because of that, I'm finding that I'm very short of breath as well, so I just got really concerned.

D: OK, I see. When did the chest pain start?

P: So, there was some discomfort like just 2 days ago, but then just yesterday it started getting very painful when I was breathing. So yeah, I would say 1 day ago.

D: OK, and were you doing anything at the time when the chest pain started? Like did you get in a car accident maybe? Or any trauma to the chest or anything you can think of?

P: No, not really. I was just at home and then I noticed that when, I like, take a deep breath in, it's just, like, a very sharp pain. It's kind of like in my right side of the chest and it feels like a stabbing pain.

D: OK, and so the pain comes on when you breathe in, or yeah, when you take a deep breath. Does the pain come on at any other points or does it go away?

P: Uh, it's mostly, yeah, I feel the sharp pain when I breathe in.

D: OK, so the pain is intermittent then, it sounds like. And has there been anything you've tried that's made the pain better?

P: Not really, just more shallow breathing, and it hurts less with that, but that's about it.

D: OK, and are there any positions that help make the pain any better like leaning forward or laying down?

P: Not really, it's uh, it's pretty much the same, I think.

D: OK, and uh, you mentioned you had shortness of breath as well. When does this come on?

P: Since yesterday it's been pretty constant and it's more like, Uh, just uh, I'm really having trouble getting any deep breaths in, so I feel like I'm having to just breathe faster and more shallow.

D: I see, OK, and has anything like this happened to you before? 

P: No, never. 

D: OK, and have you been experiencing any headaches?

P: No. 

D: How about any viral symptoms, like eye redness, nasal discharge, or nasal congestion or cough?

P: I have been having a little bit of a cough, but that's it, like, it kind of started today, but it's nothing too significant.

D: OK, alright, is the cough dry or have you brought up sputum? 

P: It is dry.

D: OK, and have you had a sore throat?

P: Uh, no.

D: How about a loss of taste or a loss of smell?

P: No. 

D: OK, how has your appetite been?

P: My appetite's been pretty good. It's like, definitely with the pain, I don't really feel like eating today, but I don't think it's changed.

D: OK, so has your weight been stable over the last several months.

P: Yeah, weight has been stable.

D: OK, and have you had any fevers, chills, or night sweats? 

P: Uhm, Nope.

P: No.

D: Have you had any nausea or vomiting?

P: No.

D: OK, and have you had any muscle aches, joint pains or skin changes?

P: No. 

D: OK, and uhm, in the past have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?

P: No, I've been pretty healthy.

D: OK, so do you take any medications regularly?

P: No, nothing at all.

D: And do you have any allergies?

P: No, no allergies. 

D: Any hospitalizations in the past or any surgeries?

P: No. 

D: OK, and currently, can you tell me just a little bit about your living situation?

P: Yeah, so I just live with uh, a couple of my roommates. I'm going to University.

D: OK.

P: I live in like a student housing situation.

D: OK, has anybody in the house been sick or anybody that you've been around been sick? 

P: No, we've been all pretty healthy.

D: OK, and do you smoke cigarettes or use any like vape products or anything like that?

P: No, I haven't ever smoked. I do smoke weed like, I would say, once or twice a week.

D: OK, and how much would you say? Like 1 gram or less or?

P: 1 gram probably lasts like 2 weeks.

D: OK, and do you drink alcohol?

P: Yeah, just a couple of beers maybe on the weekend. 

D: OK, and are you currently sexually active?

P: Yeah, just one partner, my girlfriend.

D: OK, and, do you use condoms?

D: OK, and have you had a sexually transmitted infection before?

P: No, never. 

D: OK, any concerns right now or anything like that?

P: No, I think my sister, she has asthma, but that's about it. 

D: OK, and uh, any cancers that run in the family?

P: Not that I know of.

D: OK, so it sounds like you had this uncomfortable feeling in your chest about two days ago, but the pain really came on yesterday and it's really painful when you have a deep deep breath. So, in conjunction with your symptoms of not being able to take a deep breath and being short of breath, it sounds like you possibly have what's called a pneumothorax and so we'll do a physical exam and do a chest X-ray as well to examine this and check vitals as well to make sure that you're work of breathing is OK and we can do some blood work and go from there.

P: OK, yeah, sounds good. Should be like, worried at all?

D: I think right now, you're speaking in full sentences and you're not short of breath at rest, typically, when this this happens, if it's small enough, it'll usually resolve on its own and so we'll get some more information from the imaging and the lab results, but it's reassuring that you haven't been getting worse since it happened.

00:37:98
[Speaker 2]: When it starts, it feels as if I am, I am looking for my breath, as in, as in I am gasping for my breath, like something is choking me, as if I am going to die the next minute and it actually started small gradually.
00:57:99

00:59:01
[Speaker 1]: Okay. I will be asking you few more questions about that. You said shortness of breath started gradually. Can you explain on the fatigue, Is there any thing you do that makes it worse?

[Speaker 2]: No, I haven't had any pelvic pain.

05:02:96
[Speaker 1]: Okay, so thank you Kemi. Based on your responses, your gynaecological health seems to be normal. now lets continue with the examination of your leg. so based on your on our discussion, i'll like to perform a physical examination to better understand what might be causing your symptoms. we'll start by examining your leg, your left leg and checking your temperature.

05:35:01
[Speaker 2]: Okay, Doctor

05:38:00
[Speaker 1]: Okay, so based on your symptoms and examination,it's possible that you have a condition called deep vein thrombosis, which is a blood clot in one of the deep veins in your leg. This can cause pain, swelling and fever especially if the clot breaks loose and travels to your lungs causing a pulmonary embolism. However, we will need to confirm this with some tests, such as an ultrasound of your leg, and we will also check for any signs of infection, such as cellulitis. In the meantime, we are going to prescribe some drugs, some medication to help with the pain and the swelling. so, that's what we're gonna do for now.

06:31:98
[Speaker 2]: Okay sir. thank you, doctor,

06:33:96
[Speaker 1]: okay, so is there anything else you'll like to discuss?

06:37:01

You know, numbness and tingling can be important symptoms to note. So, that's why I asked you. So, with this, along with the pain and swelling, could also indicate nerve involvement or compression. So, we'll definitely take that into consideration during our examination. So, Ms. Kemmy, let's discuss about your medical history. Have you had any chronic diseases or surgeries in the past? No, I haven't had any chronic diseases or surgeries. What about your family history? Any similar illnesses among your relatives? No, there's no family history of similar illness.

Based on your responses, your gynecological health seems to be normal. Now let's continue with the examination of your leg. So based on our discussion, I would like to perform a physical examination to better understand what might be causing your symptoms. So we'll start by examining your leg, your left leg, and shaking your tendon pressure. Okay, so based on your symptoms and examination, it's possible that you have a condition called deep vein thrombosis, which is a blood clot in one of the deep veins in your leg. This can cause pain, swelling, and fever, especially if the clot breaks loose and travels to your lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism. However, we will need to confirm this with some tests, such as an ultrasound of your leg, and we will also check for any signs of infection, such as cellulitis. In the meantime, we are going to prescribe some drugs, some medications to help with the pain and swelling. So that's what we're going to do for now.

[Speaker 2]: Ok. Doctor i have been experiencing rectal bleeding for the past two weeks and it is gotten worse. Starting off as a little bit of blood in my stool but now there's quite alot of bright red blood mixed in. I have also had change of this in my bowel cavity, going from regular to alternating between my constipation and diarrhea and i have lost some weight unintentionally and i have been feeling really tired lately 

00:36:03
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Giving these symptoms. Can i? I want to start by asking you a few more questions to understand your condition better. First is have you notice any blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet room?

01:02:01
[Speaker 2]: Yes. I definitely notice blood on the toilet paper. Sometimes there's even blood dripping into the toilet after i finished going into the bathroom 

01:16:99
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That a significant amount of bleeding. So i want to investigate on this further. So i want to ask you about your diet. Have you notice any changes in your appetite or the food you're eating? 

01:35:03
[Speaker 2]: To be honest, my appetite has been i little bit up lately. I have been feeling an unusual. I have been having to force myself to eat sometimes. I haven't really made a big changes to my diet though

01:53:02
[Speaker 1]: Ok. So Thank you for sharing this information. I have a few more questions to ask about your medical history and family history and all. First can you tell me about your past medical history including any surgeries or hospitalizations?

02:21:00
[Speaker 2]: I haven't really had any major surgeries or hospitalizations in the past. I have high blood pressure but it is well controlled with medication 

02:33:98
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That's good to hear. And regarding your family history can you tell me about your family history either your mom or your dad?

02:54:03
[Speaker 2]: Regarding my family. My father passed away from colorectal cancer 

03:02:02
[Speaker 1]: Ok

03:04:02
[Speaker 2]: That's about it and my mother has breast cancer about 10 years ago but she's been in remission for several years now. I think other than that I can't think of any other illness or cancers that run in my family 

03:23:98
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. So a family history of cancer especially colorectal cancer and breast cancer can increase your risk for developing certain cancers. But now let's talk about your social history. Do you drink or smoke?

03:55:100
[Speaker 2]: I don't smoke and i quit about 10 years ago but i do drink on occasional events 

04:06:02
[Speaker 1]: That's great. Quiting smoking can be significantly reduce your of developing several types of cancer. Now let's move on to allergies. Do you have known allergies either to medications or other substance?

04:29:99
[Speaker 2]: No. I don't have any known allergies. I have never had any issues with medication or anything else like that 

04:38:01
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. Now based on your symptoms and family history and social history there are few possible conditions that could be causing these symptoms. One possibility as you mentioned is colorectal cancer and other possibility include  inflammatory bowel disease, polyps or hemorrhoids and diverticulosis. To confirm all these conditions i would like to have some test including colonoscopy and blood test 

05:21:00
[Speaker 2]: A colonoscopy sounds a bit intimidating. Can you tell me more about what it involves? And what you expect to find? 

05:33:98
[Speaker 1]: I understand your concern and i may know a colonoscopy is a procedure where a flexible tube and a camera is inserted through the rectum and into the colon. You know, to examine of the large intestine. So it is very common and safe procedure that is used to screen for and diagnosed for colon and rectum condition. So i expect to find the cause of your symptoms whether it is cancer, polyps or something else. So you see during the colonoscopy if we find any polyps or areas of concern, we can remove small samples of the tissue for further examination. This is known as biopsy. We can also take biopsies of any abnormal looking areas in the colon lining. So to sample will then be sent to a lab for analysis to determine if they are cancerous or benign 

06:44:03
[Speaker 2]: What will happen if biopsy result shows that i have cancer doctor?

06:52:02
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Excuse me, if the biopsy results comes back as positive for cancer then we will discuss the best treatment options for you 

07:08:98
[Speaker 2]: Thank you for answering all my questions doctor. I feel a bit more informed now but also more nervous about the possibility of a cancer

07:20:01
[Speaker 1]: I understand how you feel but remember that catching any potential issues early can make a big difference. I am here to support you through this process and i will schedule the test and i will take one step at a time. So please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns 

07:45:02
[Speaker 2]: Thank you. I will be waiting for the test result and i appreciate your help 

07:50:99
[Speaker 1]: You are very much welcome. 

So based on my findings from the symptoms you shared and the information shared from the patient. There's rectal bleeding for two weeks worsening over time and change in bowel habit. There's no significant past medical history, Family history and there's also family history of colorectal and breast cancer. There's no current smoking but occasional alcohol consumption and there are no allergies. So the possible diagnosis includes colorectal cancer which is the most likely based on the symptom, family history and also social history and also the second diagnosis could be inflammatory bowel disease which is known as the IBD which is less likely due to lack of abdominal pain or diarrhea.""

Okay, so while you increase your intake of water, you still had, you still felt excessively thirsty. Yes. Okay, so have you had any previous history of such symptoms? No. Any previous surgery? Have you undergone any surgery before? Okay, um, if I may ask, do any of your family members have history of diabetes? My mom had type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes. Yes. Okay, I'll take that down. So what? The patient is a 45 year old female who complains of frequent urination and excessive thirst. The excessive thirst has lasted for two weeks. sensation or associated pain during urination. My diagnosis is I suspect the patient has diabetes mellitus, specifically type 2 diabetes. The symptoms of frequent urination, excessive thirst, fatigue and unintentional weight loss are classic signs of diabetes. For further diagnosis, I will request a fasting plasma glucose test and a oral glucose tolerance test."," your age um 45 years old male or female female okay please what brings you yesterday okay so if i heard you correct you experienced frequent urination and excessive test yes okay so how long has this been going on for um within these two weeks of frequent radiation yes okay have you lost weight recently yes i've lost about two kg without trying you are not dieting i'm not trying to lose weight i'm not dieting just within the just it's nothing serious over time it would you know it would stop oh um except for like i tried this for like two days where i would drink a lot of water to see if i wouldn't get tested quick and it was just like there was no difference How's your lifestyle? What do you do for a living? I'm an accountant, so I'm always behind the computer, so I don't really do much. I'm not really into exercise.

It started small… small but then it started getting worse, getting worse, getting worse and it has just been. You say it's very serious. How would you rate it over 10? how serious? It started yesterday I will say maybe about four, but the way it is now is like 7 / 10 is seriously banging. It has been, has been getting worse. Yes, Sir. All right, so is it dull or sharp? I'll say it's a dull pain. It's dull but very serious. It's very, very conc headache. You said its banging, is it like, do you have this throbbing feeling? Exactly something like that. Have you noticed any visual disturbances? Yes. Blurring of vision.

Abdominal pain? Pain around your chest? No, not at all. No. Have you been having any, any difficulties breathing? Not at all. How about vomiting, not vomiting, not vomiting, OK, no, no. So your blood, blood pressure before this pregnancy, how's it been?  Like, has anyone ever told you that you have high blood pressure?

Any chest pain currently? No, not at all? No. How about palpitations? Do you feel like your heart is beating heavily against your chest? No. How about leg swelling? ehn,..I noticed that actually in this pregnancy too. Yes, my leg has been swollen. OK. So, these symptoms are, is there anything that's making it worse or relieving the symptoms? Is there anything that relieves the headache or makes it worse? I use paracetamol, but the paracetamol is not working at all. Is the headaches there... not working. Have you done any other things so far apart from taking paracetamol? No. No. OK, so let's, let's talk about your previous pregnancies. How was the, how was it delivered your last baby? It was normal delivery. Was it a male or female? A female? Female. What was the birth weight? I gave birth to it myself. Ok it was 2.7 two point seven. Yes. OK. And then this pregnancy, how exactly was it conceived? You conceived it on your own. Was there any assistance? No, it was just me and my husband. You know, and I've done scan. I've done. So, it's actually a twin pregnancy. OK, yes. From the last scan that they did, it's safe to assume that you want to keep this pregnancy. This pregnancy is desired. oh yes, definitely. All right. Do you have any other medical conditions, say diabetes? No. No. OK, how's your menstruation been like? before this pregnancy? Any painful menstruation? Bleeding? No No… Normally at… at 14 years of age and there's not been any problem. I do my period regularly before the pregnancy. All right, so no pain during sex, No vaginal discharge for that? No at all. All right. So, you've not had any surgery in the past? No. No surgery. All right, So, if I heard you correctly… correctly, you're married. Yes? Yes, I am you live with your husband? Yes. OK. Do you drink, do you smoke? And My daughter And your daughter? Do You drink? No, I don't smoke. Erm… in this pregnancy, No. But before I got pregnant, you know once in a while like a smoke, let's say just a glass of wine, you know, red wine maybe, like twice weekly. But that was before the pregnancy. But, since I've confirmed my baby, I don't drink at all. OK Are you on any routine medications? It's just the, you know, the routine drugs you just gave us in the hospital, like pregnan care and all of those, those are the things I'm using. OK, All right. So, from your history it is highly suggestive that you have preeclampsia. I don't know if you… you were told in your previous pregnancy of this condition but it's similar to what happened in the previous pregnancy. Sometimes you're during pregnancy the BP gets high, and it's caused by the pregnancy actually and then after delivery it's resolves. So, at this gestational age, 30 weeks, it's advisable that we start to place you on some medications to control this, the…  the rising BP, because we wouldn't want you to have complications of preeclampsia and complications will definitely involve seizure, yes. And we don't want that to happen. So it's advisable that we place you on blood pressure medications to reduce your blood, blood pressure and then we also want to put you on magnesium sulfates. But before we do any of that, we'd like to send you send you for some tests, send you to the lab to do some tests, and then want to recheck your blood pressure and keep monitoring them. But the test we'd like you to be on, we want you to do a full blood count, electrolytes, urea and creatinine and then uric acid. We'd also want you to do a liver function test, cause your liver may also be affected. That could be a complication of the condition also. So, we want you to do all of that and then we'd like you to have a repeat scan so that we can know how correctly your baby was placed. Then, it's very important that you do a urinalysis. Also want to see how much protein you have in your urine and that would severely influence our management. So, after doing that, I would like to start you on some medications. Magnesium sulphate, I don't know if you are familiar, you must have had that in your previous pregnancy. We want to put you on magnesium sulphate to prevent you from having any feet or seizures, right And then like I said, we'd put you on blood pressure medications also. So we just to we hope that you'll be fine and we'll be able to continue this pregnancy. We'd also want to give you some steroids so that's your baby's lungs, can develop faster should in case we have to deliver your child. However, you should know that this condition puts you at the risk of having a Cesarean section 'cause if, if in any case you are not able to control your blood pressure properly, It is very important that we deliver you of this child. So, we'll put you on the steroids. So that's per adventure we have to deliver your child before term. I'm aware, I'm sure you must be aware that the term is 37 weeks, and you are 37. You are 30 weeks currently. So, in case we can't get you to 37 weeks fully, we want your child's lung to have matured enough and that will be the reason for putting you on steroids. Are you following me, Ma? Hello, Ma. Can you hear me ma? Hello. All right, so if you have any questions, please let me know. Not at all, Doctor. Not at all, All right. I think that will be the end.",640.297,med-convo-nig,"So good morning ma. Good morning sir. How are you doing today? I'm not fine now. Oh wow. What is the complaint for today? I'm having a headache.

I don't know if you were told in your previous pregnancy of this condition or it's similar to what happened in the previous pregnancy. Sometimes your during pregnancy, the BP gets high and it's passed by the pregnancy actually and then after delivery, it resolves. So at this gestational age, 32 weeks, it's advisable that we start to place you on some medications to control this. of that and then we'd like you to have you repeat so that we can know how correctly your baby was placed. Then it's very important that you do a urinalysis also. Want to see how much protein you have in your urine and that would severely influence our management. So after doing that I would like to start you on some medications. Magnesium sulfate I don't know if you are familiar you must have had that in your previous pregnancy. We want to put you on blood pressure medications also. So with those two we hope that you'll be fine and we'll be able to continue this pregnancy. We'd also want to give you some steroids so that your baby's lungs can develop faster. Should in case we have to deliver the child. However you should know that this condition puts you at the risk of having a caesarean section. Because if in any case you are unable to control your blood pressure properly, it is very important that we deliver you of this child. So we put you on the steroids. So that's for adventure we have to deliver your child before 10. I'm aware I'm sure you must be aware that 10 is 7 weeks and you are 30 weeks currently. So in case We can't get you to thirty seven weeks free. We want your child to long to have matured enough and that will be the reason for putting you on steroids. Are you following me, Ma? Hello, Ma.

I’m…I'm not feeling too great. That's why I'm here. But I'm OK. Yes, I've been listening in on the conversation and I have just a few more questions to ask you and I'm sorry about your health. Erm, am I permitted to go on? Yes you are, you are. Thank you.   Alright, thank you. No, no, no, I don't feel that way. Do you feel some electric shock in your hands or legs at any point? No, no, no, no, I don't. Alright, thank you for that. Has there been any reduction in your urine output recently? Umm, no, no, it has just been the same. I can’t…I didn't notice any change.

No, no, no, not that I can remember, can’t remember anything like that. Thank you very much No, I…I just want to get better. I don't have any questions. OK, before I go, what was the reading at the outreach when they told you your blood pressure was elevated? Uh, they told me 162 / 100. Alright, thank you. Measuring that at least twice in the space of 4 to 6 hours is when we make a diagnosis of hypertension and with your family history that's in your dad and with some of your history of…what's it called? Headache, palpitation, we uh…tend to think that you have a high blood pressure which is also called hypertension in this case, and really it's manageable. We’ll prescribe some drugs for you. But before we do most of those things, we would also want you to do some investigations. Yes, I understand. I'm following. Yes, so we would like you to do a chest x-ray, we would like you to do an ECG. We would like to also take your blood pressure again to confirm what the reading says today and then we would like to also book you for a regular appointment for the next few months, just to make sure that we are able to monitor you. We are going to place you on some drugs. We are going to start with a calcium channel blocker. This is one of the drugs used to treat hypertension. And we would also like to advise you on some lifestyle modification, um I don't know how much of alcohol you’ve had in the past or you do, but you will have to either reduce that or quit if you are…if you take alcohol. Yeah also, you have to stay away from smoking, use of tobacco. You'd also have to reduce your salt intake as much as possible. So in hypertension, what happens is that the body has a lot of salt and then it retains water and because it retains water, the heart has so much to do to pump that fluid round the body. And that is why it needs…it has to do more work, and it is the work that it has to do that increases the blood pressure. So that is why…that is why you have to reduce your salt intake as much as possible. We also have to check your lipid profile. By checking your lipid profile, we're trying to make sure that you do not have any dyslipidemia, which usually also contributes to hypertension. And with all of these tests done, as soon as you get the result back, we’ll know the next steps to take. Do you understand everything I’ve said? Hmm yes, I think I understand. I do. Thank you so much. Do you have any anything that we have not addressed today? Maybe, I was thinking I’ll also get something to help me sleep better. Or is it after I treat, I’ll begin to sleep better? Definitely we’ll help you…we would give you something to help you sleep better. Um, yes sorry I didn’t mention that. That is also common with elevated blood pressure, and it is something that we can manage. So would also give you something to help you sleep better, and we’ll see you in the clinic after your result, your test results are out. Alright, thank you.

So, I would like to say that first, I'm sorry about this. Hypertension is one of the chronic diseases that it doesn't go away. And if your blood pressure is elevated to a certain level, for some cases, it has to be over 140/90. 61, 10 or in some other cases it could be above 140, 90. Measuring that at least twice in the space of 46 hours is when we make a diagnosis of hypertension. And with your family history, that's your dad and with some of your history of, what's it called, headache, palpitations, we tend to think that you have a high blood pressure, which is also called hypertension in this case. And really, it's manageable. We'll prescribe some drugs for you. But before we do most of those things, we also want you to do some investigations. First, we'd like to know if this hypertension has been there for a while or either it's just started. So do you understand what I'm saying? Yes, I understand, I'm following. Yes, so we'd like you to do a chest X-ray. We'd like you to do an ECG. We'd like to also take your blood pressure again to confirm what the reading says today.

I'm here to register for antenatal. Wow. Okay. Congratulations. Thank you. Is this is this your first pregnancy? No, actually, Doctor. I've been pregnant before. Okay. How how long ago was this? I think I was in my final year then. So that was like 2 years ago. OK, but what happened to the pregnancy if I may ask? Well, I was not ready, so I removed it. OK. Do you remember….how was it removed? Was it pills or you had an evacuation done? No, I just used some tablets. OK. Alright, so this is your second pregnancy. Do you remember your last…your last menstrual period? The last time I had my period, I had it for four days from December 1st to December 4th, thereabout. OK, December 1st, OK. So that places your pregnancy at about 14 weeks, 14 weeks and yeah…OK, so do you do you have any complaints today? I just feel like it’s time to come and register the pregnancy, but sometimes I have…I get this lower.. lower tummy pain that started recently. OK, what’s the nature of the pain? Just there, it's not something too bothersome, so it's just dull, just there. It doesn't bother me so much. If you were to grade the pain on a scale of one to 10, how would you grade the pain? Well, about average, less than average. So like that 3-4. Okay okay. Is there anything that relieves the pain or is there anything that means the pain worse? Not really, not really. OK, does the pain radiate to any other part other than…from that lower part of your abdomen? It's just there. It’s just in that lower tummy. Okay, so is there…is there any, do you experience any pain when you're urinating? Yeah, doctor. I noticed that too. So I have this like…I have this like peppery feeling when I’m  about to…when I'm about to start urinating. Is that normal, Doctor? OK, no, that's not normal. So hopefully we get to the root of why you're having that yeah? OK. So are you having a fever? Well, sometimes I feel warm in the night. OK. But you don't...It's that's..something really mild. OK. The…let’s talk about..are you…are you having any vaginal discharge or did you notice…have you noticed any discharge from the vagina recently or any bleeding? No, doc OK, OK, the..the current pregnancy, how did you conceive? you’re… are you married or how...how did you conceive? Was it something you conceived spontaneously or IVF or…or what was the mode? How did you conceive? No, it was natural. And I recently got married, yeah, I recently got married. Yeah. But we were hoping to wait for one more year. But it’s fine. So this was unplanned. Not really, we didn't plan to have a baby now OK, OK. Do you remember when you first saw…when you saw your period first as a…as a lady. that was… I was like 14 years. I think I was in JS one, yeah, 14 years. OK, OK. Yeah, it's usually like 28 to 30 days usually. OK And how long does the cycle…how long does the flow last? Sometimes three, sometimes 5. OK, Is there…is there any…Is there excessive pain or excessive bleeding? Bleeding? I'm not bleeding. Oh, you mean for my period? Yes, from the period…Is there…Is there any excessive bleeding or pain? No, it's usually just normal. OK. Is there any pain when you're meeting with…during intercourse with your spouse? No, at all. OK, So have you had a Pap smear done before? I've not. OK, do you know what a…do you know what a pap smear? I think that's one for cervical cancer, right? Yes, Yes, very well. It's right. So you've had it done before, you said? no, no, I've not done it before. OK. Now? can I do family planning now that I'm pregnant? No. Like before now. Did you…did you have an idea of what it was? OK, so I didn't use any form of family planning, and I'm scared because of the side effects. I’ve not thought of using it before. OK, Do you…do you have any…are you treating any chronic illness such as hypertension or diabetes? No, no, I'm fine. OK. Is there any family history of twins? No OK. Is there any family of miscarriages or anything pertaining to pregnancy? Anything you want us to know about? No OK. Have you had any surgeries done before? No, doctor. What about blood transfusion? No, I’ve not. what about…do you have any drug allergies I react to chloroquine Oh, OK, OK. You're married, you said, how old is your husband and what does he do? My husband is 27. He's into tech. More of…okay like a software…okay. Do you drink or smoke alcohol? Do you drink or you smoke, rather. Do you drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes? No OK, OK. So I would…before…before I tell you, before we discuss further on what…what...what I think, I would love to just examine you. Okay? OK. I would want to…I would call in my nurse who will serve as a chaperone. A chaperone is someone, yeah…so I'll call in the nurse, she’ll serve as a chaperone. We'll just…I'll just examine you, examine your abdomen and…and so that I can come to a better conclusion of what's happening. I hope…I hope you're OK with that. I hope you're comfortable with that. Okay doctor. Alright, so now let me share what I think. so from…from all indications you are…you… although you…you…there's a…there's an active pregnancy which…did…did you tell me if you confirmed the pregnancy by yourself? did you say…did you tell me that? did you confirm it? I'm not sure if you asked but yeah I took the urine test and then I went to the hospital for a blood test. OK OK, So one of the things we would also do here is just to confirm it with a blood test again, do you understand? I've done a blood test Before, OK good. So if you are…the symptoms you're having, the symptoms of the lower abdominal pain are symptoms that can be seen in early pregnancy but when you now look at the pain you have, the peppery feeling when you're urinating, you might also be having a urinary tract infection, which is…which is…which is most also likely, do you understand? Okay Then some of the other things that can cause lower abdominal pain is maybe having fibroid coexisting with pregnancy, but that might not cause you to have a fever but this line of thought would…would influence the test I would run. I want to do a full blood count, then we'll take your sample for urinalysis and urine culture. Okay Yes, so that the abdominopelvic scan will confirm the pregnancy and it will also help us to see if there's any infection or anything, maybe fibroid or anything that might…might support what we are thinking. Do you understand? Then from there we'll treat. So the urine culture might take a few days, so the results that can be reviewed today, such as the full blood count, urinalysis and abdominal pelvic scan, we’d review, then you might have to come back in a few days for the culture, the result of the culture and sensitivity. Alright. And do you have any questions? OK, Yeah. Yes, Doctor. So I think I've gone to one hospital and they said that my blood group is B-negative. Can I check to, to be sure? Will it affect my baby? OK, no. Some of…some of the…at 14 weeks now, we would also register you for antenatal care, you understand. So ideally, because of the…my thoughts of the urinary tract infection, I wanted to resolve that first but now you're here, and there's an active pregnancy, Once we have…we are done with the abdomen pelvic scan, all of it is confirmed, we'll register you for antenatal care, and some of the other tests we’ll want to include will be your blood group, your genotype, then we’ll do some viral screening. These are tests to just be sure that the pregnancy can proceed properly, well and there's nothing to worry about. Do you understand? So we’ll do your blood group, your genotype, the viral screening, then they'll check your…they'll just do your random blood sugar, just some baseline tests so that we'll have some baseline, you understand. Okay Then we'll also commence you on some medications to support the pregnancy like vitamins, iron, calcium, and then we'll give you appointments for your antenatal visits. So I'll discuss more about this when we are reviewing the results, OK? OK. Yes, so do you have any other questions, Ma? No, doctor. Alright, so thank you. I will send you to the lab now, Okay? Alright, thank you. And have a nice day. You too, thank you. OK.",834.752,med-convo-nig,"Hi, Dr. Ladipo. Hi, Dr. Ladipo. Hi, Dr. Ladipo. Hi, Dr. Ladipo. Hi, Dr. Ladipo. Hi, Dr. Ladipo.

Doctor I've been having this abdominal pain for the last two weeks. Sorry to hear that. No It’s that upper part of the…it’s central The middle part that is closer to your chest or your breast? Yes, that is closer to…yes it’s that place. Ok Sorry to hear that. For the last two weeks, Doctor. That would have been so, so discomforting. Yes, doctor. So what is this pain like? Can you describe it? Ah, doctor, this pain, it’s like it’s burning me. It’s like it’s burning. Oh, sorry. Does it come and go or it’s always there? Yes, it comes and goes. It will come, it will go. OK. Ah, doctor, once I refuse to eat like this, the pain will be so much. Ok when you eat, does it feel better? Yes, once I eat food like this, everything just stops and will reduce it by itself. OK Are there things that you eat that make this pain also bad even though you’ve just eaten? I can't…I can't seem to…I can't seem…There is nothing. OK Sorry to hear that. Are you vomiting? No, I'm not vomiting, doctor. OK. Are you purging, like going to toilet frequently? No, doctor. I'm not going to toilet frequently. Any temperature? Doctor, my body is not hot. OK this pain, do you feel it any other place apart from that middle of your chest, like maybe your back, your shoulder? Yes, that pain usually goes to my back when it starts. OK, if I could run this pain on a scale zero to 10, where zero is like where you don't have any pain, and 10 the worst pain of your life, what would this pain be? Doctor, the pain is usually between three and six, sometimes three, sometimes six. That's much. Sorry to hear that. I've not taken anything, Doctor. OK. No, I did not do...I did not do any fasting recently. OK. May I know your last menstrual period, please? That was one month ago. OK, Like exactly one month. No, no, no. Exactly one month. I should be expecting it soon. Alright, no problem. Yes Doctor. Oh, I see. Sorry about that. Apart from…apart from this pain, have you had any surgeries in the past? No, doctor, I've not had any surgeries. OK. Do you drink or smoke? I don't drink alcohol. I don't smoke cigarettes. OK, That's good to know. So from everything you've told me for your age and your presenting symptoms, since I can't see you, there are a few things that I think might be causing your pain. OK, that's actually what it looks like because of your habits-not eating regularly, the use of this pain relief, there are some of these pain relief that can predispose you to having intense pain. So before I get to the management, lest I forget, so next time you're having body pains or anything, please stick to paracetamol. Okay doctor. So the second thing that might be wrong could be a gallbladder stone First, you're going to do what is called H pylori test. It will give us an idea if this is ulcer or something else. Okay? Okay doctor Yeah, I would have loved you to also do an abdominal scan to make sure even if it's ulcer, it's not complicated or there are no other things causing the ulcer. OK, there are a few drugs I will want you to buy. You're going to take these drugs for about two weeks and you should be fine. OK. Please, when you get the result, I would like to see it okay? Okay Doctor. I would also love to give you an antacid like Gestid, something that will give you a fast relief okay? Yes doctor. For now, the advice I have for you is try and eat regularly. Be also mindful because you might gain weight so you don't eat indiscriminately. OK I’ll make sure to do that. And just like I said, yeah, the pain reliefs you've been taking, also try to stay off them and you can stick to paracetamol. That’s just all. Is there anything, I missed…anything you want to say? No, nothing at the moment, Doctor. Alright. So I'll wait for the results of the test then. Okay Thank you very much, I appreciate. Thank you so much. Alright. Yes. Bye Bye.

Good evening. Good evening, doctor. How are you doing today, Sir? I'm fine, thank you. Yeah, So I'll be taking your complaints today. But, before then, can you please tell me your name? OK, So, my name is Mr Makinde. OK, how old are you? I'm 60 60 years old Sir. All right, So what's your complaint for today? The right side of my body. Yes. Is weak, is not, is not moving well at all. OK. So how long has that been going on for? It's about four hours ago. 4 hours. OK, what... exactly. I was watching Ball in the Parlor. I was watching Nigeria and South Africa. All of a sudden, I cannot move this my hand. All right. Did you collapse? Were you seated when it happened? Yes, I was seated. But, you know, we were watching match and everybody was jumping. OK. Can you tell me your last meal? My last what, Sir? Your last meal, Your last meal before the incident. Oh, it was the night. It was it. Maybe like 7, let's say 6-7 hours before then. But I was drinking something. All right, so your right arm and leg, is it just a little bit weak? Can you move it at all, or you can't move it at all? Can you move it a little bit? I could not, I could not move it very well. Then I also noticed that, you know, I could not talk very well. And there was... spit was coming out from my mouth. So but the weakness, the weak, the weakness has it… has it been progressing. Is it getting worse? Yes, it seems like it's getting worse, but no I can talk better now. But when the thing happened that time. It was just… I could not move my hand, I could not move my leg. I just stayed in one place and there was all spit dropping from my mouth. From your mouth, Yes. you able to talk? I could not talk very well. I was just… I could not talk. I was just looking, I could not say much. You could not say much. All right. So, was there any headache around when it happened? Yes. Before the match, the headache was very bad. I had very serious headache. All right. Can you see properly? Are you having any visual erm…? Not at all. Not at all. No, Sir. OK, how about breathing? Any difficulty breathing? No at all, Sir. So before the incident, you said you didn't collapse on the floor. You didn't collapse on the. You know, it's like someone should just…I was watching match and then the next thing I know, suddenly I just fell down like this. Not like I hit my head or anything, I just could not move my hand again, I could not move my leg again, I was just as if… I don't know what happened, It just happened suddenly like that. Oh, sorry about that. But basically, it sounds like you can recall everything that happened, so you had no memory loss? No at all. I remember everything happened now. I remember everything. How about any seizure? Did you? No seizure. Yes, At any point. I didn't know what, Sir. Lose consciousness at any point? No. All right, So, are you a known diabetic? No, I'm not, no. How about hypertension? Ahh... Yes Oh, you’re Hyper… Yes. OK. There… been any diagnosis made for any other heart conditions apart from hypertension? No. The doctor gave me some drugs for the blood pressure. But you know, its not easy... for a man to be… seeing a doctor for the blood… Sir? You've been seeing a doctor for the blood pressure? Yes, I have. But you know, it's not… It's not easy to be using drugs. They wrote some drugs for me, but I don't use it every day. Sometimes I use… I feel like the DP is high, I will use it Sometimes I don't use it. OK, that's not too good enough, Sir. It's very important that you use your drugs constantly and failure to comply erm… Failure to comply can lead to erm…what's happening to you currently. So how about the the clinic visits, do you go often? No, sometimes. I miss it, though. OK. All right. So how about drinks, do you take alcohol? You drink? Yes, I do. You drink. How about smoking? I smoke very well. All right. Have you had any family member have a similar situation before? Has this happened to any family member? Yes, actually, my daddy too that time they said it was heart attack that killed him. OK, so you have a dad that died from heart attack? Yes, Sir. All right, all right, all right. That's OK. Is it possible for you to read me your vital side? OK, my temperature was 36°. The pulse rate is 87 beats per minute, BP 160 / 100. All right Respiratory Rate is 12 cycles per minute and SP is 98%. All right, 98 percent 98. 8 8. All right, that's totally fine. Basically, from all that you've… you've told me so far, I have been able to gather that it is very likely that you have a stroke, although this has been going on for four hours, so we're not so sure whether it's permanent or not. So, it could either be a stroke or a transient ischemic attack. Both are basically almost the same thing, the only difference is the time with which they present and for now it's been about four hours at less than a day. So, it's still possible that it might reverse. So basically, what I want to do first is to send you for a test to know whether it's actually a stroke or not. So, you're going to be doing a scan, right? OK And this scan will tell us what kind of stroke, if it's a stroke, what kind of stroke is it? Because basically I have two types. Sorry, I didn't get that. What? What type of scan am I doing, Sir? Yes, you are going to do a CT scan. OK. Yes, you’re going to do a CT scan. My whole body? No, just your head. So, it's a scan that just gives us an image of what's going on in your head. We want to know whether any vessel ruptured, or any vessel is being blocked. Are you with me, Sir? I’m with you, Sir. All right, so that scan, you're going to tell us whether a vessel is being blocked or a vessel ruptured each. Both scenarios can present with similar symptoms, and so the scan is important for us to be able to differentiate between the two. However, then we'll still place you on oxygen and monitor your vitals very closely. Are you with me, Sir? Yes, I'm here. I'm with you, Sir. So, the results of the scan would determine the next line of management. So, if it is a… if it is a ischemic stroke would most likely want to place you on some anticoagulants and thrombolytic agents to break down the blood clots that is causing occlusion. However, if it is a… if it's an hemorrhagic stroke, we would want to place you on an antihypertensive that will make sure that the hemorrhage does not get worse. But it is very important that you go for that scan as soon as possible so that the condition does not worsen, and hopefully if it is not a stroke, we are hoping that some of these symptoms would reverse. Do you understand? Can I do the scan tomorrow? No, you can't. It's today as soon as possible. OK Sir. Yes please. So, do you have any questions for me? No, Sir, not at all. You've answered all my questions. All right, All right. That's great. So that would be the end for today's consultation. All right. Thank you, Doctor. You're welcome, Sir.",567.174,med-convo-nig,"Good evening, sir. Good evening, good evening, good evening, doctor. How are you doing today, sir? I'm fine, thank you.

And so this kind is important for us to be able to differentiate between the two. However, then we'll still place you on oxygen and monitor your vitals very closely. Are you Umeza? are hoping that some of these symptoms would reverse the understanding. Can I do this tomorrow? No, you can't. It's today, as soon as possible. Okay, sir. Yes, please.

What do you do? I'm an accountant. All right, Mr. Akeem So, what's your complaints today? Well, I've been having this cough for like 2 days now. OK, so this cough, when did you know… you noticed it Two days ago, Was it a sudden cough? Were you doing… the cough started? Did you inhale, swallow something or it just started on its own? No, no, it's it's started gradually, OK, gradually. you describe this cough, Does it sound barky in nature? No, it doesn't. OK Is it associated with vomiting? No Vomiting. OK. So, this cough, is it a continuous cough that's, you know, it interrupts your breathing when it starts? No, I don't think that has ever happened. OK, noticed. is there any mucus coming out? Is it productive? No. OK, so it's more of a dry cough? Yes, it's dry. OK. So, on an, on an average, since the cough started, how bad is it on a scale of one to 10? I'll give it, I'll give it a 7, it's really painful, yeah. So, I get chest pain when I cough. Whenever the cough comes. Cough. Yes Sorry about that.  Do you notice it If it's worse in the morning or at night or it could be at any time? It's usually worse at night. Usually, it becomes way more frequent than during the day. It happens all the time, but it becomes more frequent at night. OK. So, you said you have some chest pains, too. Yes. Is there any difficulty breathing? Yes. I find it really difficult, very difficult to breathe sometimes. And. OK, do you never notice? Has anyone ever told you maybe you whistle when you're sleeping? Has anyone ever said something like that to you? Yeah. Yes. My wife complained of that. OK, OK. So is there any fever? Do you have any temperature? No. OK, what about Catarrh? Do you have catarrh? No. No Catarrh currently, no Catarrh. Have you been in contact with anyone coughing in recent times? No. Any night sweats? Do you notice that you sweat excessively, especially at night? No… No doctor. Any weight loss? at all? Not at all. OK. So if I may ask, have you noticed maybe you sneeze a lot when perfume is around you or you smell maybe a strong scent, Have you noticed anything like that? Yes, Yes, that's correct. OK, that's OK. So, was there any recent travel? Did you travel far, maybe any dusty environment in recent times? No, no. No, OK, you… are you…Do you have any known allergies. Anything you're allergic to? Well, sometimes I don't really have strong allergies, but I noticed that whenever I inhale fumes or dust or perfumes, if someone uses a strong perfume close to me, I start to sneeze and sometimes it progresses to a cough and I I start finding it difficult to breathe. OK, I see. Is there any food you don't eat that you have allergic response to? No, no, no. Let me ask, do you have any family history of asthma? Or you’re not sure? Sorry Doctor, I, I, I I'm allergic to nuts. Nuts. Yes. okay… eat nuts… What do you notice? When I eat nuts, I notice swelling around my… around my face sometimes and then I… I notice also this rash around my arm, my face, my body generally Oh, I see. OK. So I was asking if you know any, if there's anybody in your family with history of asthma, maybe your cousin, your dad, your uncle, any issue of asthma? Well, I think my aunt does. My aunt does. OK, that is good. Are you currently on any medication? I have been having this leg pain for a while, so currently I'm on ibuprofen. OK, for the leg pain, for how long have you been using it? I've been taking it for like 5 days now. OK, so asides the cough now, has there been any, you know, whenever you're sleeping you wake up because you can't breathe well have you noticed any of that? No. OK, Any leg swelling? Leg swelling, No. Not that I've noticed, No. Are you hypertensive? No, I am not. OK. Any vomiting? Any stooling? Not at all. Great. Are you diabetic? Have I… Have I asked you that? No, you haven't. But I am not. Do you have ulcer? No, I don't. OK. Please sorry to ask, do you smoke cigarettes? No, I don't. How about alcohol, do you drink alcohol? alcohol, I don't take alcohol, doctor. OK, good. So aside ibuprofen you're taking currently for your knee pain, is there any other medication you take routinely? currently, no No. So, I've listened to your complaints and given your history of, you know, the cough which is what's at night and is a non productive cough as well. Yeah, that's correct. Reaction to, you know, strong sense like perfumes and fumes generally. And you also mentioned you have allergies to nuts. Yes. OK. And then the family history. So, your history is pointing in the direction of asthma, bronchial asthma. I don't know if you're aware of it have you heard of asthma before? I'm sure you said your auntie is asthmatic, so I'm sure you'll be familiar with asthma. 18 Yes… Yes. But, I never really thought I have it myself. Yes, it seems like, you know, it's possible to have missed it in childhood and it's a late onset asthma. And we’re starting to see the symptoms now. OK, OK. Although we could also have some other cases, but it's pointing towards, you know, asthma and then you don't smoke, right? No, I do not. And then you're an accountant, you mentioned that earlier. Yes, yes. You don't exactly have exposure to some kind of, you know, chemicals in factories because factory workers too could have such exposure. But it's tilting towards us now, although we would like to do some other tests to rule out possible possibilities to, you know, possible differentials such as, you know, COPD, which is the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, have you heard that before? yes. But what tests exactly are we talking about, Doctor? So, we're going to do a lung function test, which is…peak flowmeter of which we're going to give you something to blow it into, Ok And then we're also going to do a spirometry for you, which we're trying to confirm our diagnosis. So, like I said, you know, it's might… most likely an asthma, but you know we also have to check out the other possibilities. So, in the spirometry tests we're going to, you know, give you a bronchodilator and then we'll measure your… the ratio of the FEV over FVC volume of which if it gets better then it will confirm our diagnosis of asthma and would most likely put you on some bronchodilators and corticosteroids. But asides that, I would also want to advise you on some lifestyle changes, you know, because for someone that's asthmatic, you have to stay away from the triggers. So, I would advise that, you know, stay away from dusty environment. And I'm sorry, I forgot to mention, in the parlor, where in your sitting room do you use towels or rug? No, I do not. I do not. What's the kind of flooring there? Sorry, I didn't get that. You're flooring like the floor. Is it tiles or rug? Oh, tiles, tiles, tiles. OK, That's OK. OK, You understand? And I'm going to also write medications for you. Like, I'm sure you've seen an inhaler before. Yes. OK, good. So, I'm going to advise that wherever you're…sorry I'm going to, I'm going to have to be on an inhaler. Yes. Wow. Wow. To Prevent future attacks. And then in case of an acute attack, you can always have one in case of emergencies like that, in case you're having a poor breathing. So you're just going to pull out the inhaler and you just give about two puffs. You take a deep breath, inhale, take two puffs and then you breathe it in. Yes, I do. OK. Also, you had, like I said, most important thing is lifestyle modifications. You have to stay away from things that can trigger your asthma, extreme positions, extreme stress. Yeah, I'm with you, Doctor. OK, then just your environment generally. OK. So, we'd also want to just do some other investigations, such as the chest X-ray, just to look at the lungs. Generally, That's fine. Yes, that's fine. There's no problem. And I also run a full blood count, so just to look at your lymphocytes and your eosinophils. All right. All right. All right. Check your temperature. Check your SPO 2 levels. The vitals. Yes, I do. Can you run through? All right, so here it says that my temperature is 37°. my respiratory rate is 12 circles per minute, 97%. Spo2 is 97%, OK. Uhm, my pulse rate is 70 beats per minute, 70 beats. OK is 120/80mmHg. Your What? I didn't get that Sorry. My blood pressure. Your blood pressure. OK Is what? Yeah, 120/80 mmHg. OK. Thank you so much. OK. So, what we're going to do is we're going to run the tests like I've mentioned earlier. And pending for that time. I'll put you on some medications, like I mentioned, the Bronchodilators. Whenever the results are out, we'll know what to do from there. Would you like to ask for me anything? Well, I think I so far, I understand basically how that you've you've said. Uhm… So yes, we can just go ahead with the test and then I'll have the that you've prescribed. Thank you Mr Akeem for your time so we...",774.232,med-convo-nig,"Good evening, sir. Good evening, doctor. How are you doing today? I'm very fine, thank you. How are you? How are you?

Do you understand? Do you still have any question, any clarification you would like for me to make? If I come, will the surgery happen today or will it happen later? Once you come, we will examine. Do you understand? It's an emergency. If we examine and we find out that it is one of those things I mentioned, we will most likely have to do the surgery as soon as possible. It might be today because the longer it stays the worse it becomes. Do you understand? Yes, doctor. Thank you so much. I appreciate. I will try. Thank you."," Good afternoon.

Do you have any known drug allergies? No, I don't. Is there any routine drug you are on currently? I'm not on any medications right now. OK. All right. Mrs Tolulope, I've been able to listen to all your complaints. No, not not really. OK, so we have a thyroid gland that's located in our neck and the anterior part of our neck that helps with our body metabolism. It helps to keep our body regulation in check, you understand. So, it produces some hormones and, in that case, it looks like one of the hormones is overproduced. means it's produced more than what it should produce. That is why it's given some of the symptoms you've complained of today. What I would need to do for you is I'm going to carry out some investigations for you. It's… first investigation is going to be the thyroid function test which we're going to look at all the thyroid hormones to be sure If the hormone is actually… there's an imbalance in the thyroid hormones, then I'm also… all right. I'm also going to do just in thyroid scan just look at the thyroid gland in case there's an enlargement, although you did mention that there's no neck swelling, but it'll also be good to also have a look at thyroid grand OK. And also given the issue of the palpitations that you mentioned, that's your heart beating fast. It would also be safe to just look at the ECG to just be sure that the heart cont… Everything is going on fine there as well. OK. So we'll carry out all these tests and given your age and and well I think after we do the thyroid gland, it might not be out of place to also do you know maybe a just an aspiration of the thyroid gland But I think we should do the scan first and whatever the result says we would know what to do further from there. But pending the time, I'm going to place you on some beta blockers just to, you know, relieve the palpitations that you are feeling. OK OK, So I'm going to write out some prescriptions for you just to… so that you don't stay… it’ll stop, it’ll reduce the anxiety and the palpitations you're feeling, like atenolol and then I'm also going to give you some antithyroid drugs as well. All right. All right. I hope they're not too expensive. Oh, not at all. But I would write them out for you. So, do you have any other questions? No, no, for now. But if I do, I would, I'd definitely reach out, OK. So, if I may add too you know, because given the age you're 42, it is actually very common, you know in women at this age range, but just we can also want to rule out a thyroid cancer too. OK. So, after we carry out all these tests, we'll be able to figure out what we're dealing with here. So, starting with a thyroid hormone. So, do I have your go ahead? Yes, please. All right, Sir. OK, Thank you. Okay Doctor.",744.139,med-convo-nig,"Good evening, sir. Good evening, doctor. I'm fine, thank you, sir. Can I get your name, please? All right, I'm Tolu Okpe. Is that Mr. or Miss?

Okay, okay, is there any drug? Do you have any non-drug allergies? No, I don't. Do you have any routine drug you are on currently? I'm not on any medications right now. Okay, all right, Missus Toli Lokhe, I've been able to listen to all your complaints. And from the complaints I'm seeing, this looks like a case of, you know, hyperthyroidism. I don't know if you've had of the thyroid gland before. Do we have a thyroid gland? The neck? Have you heard of it before, sir? No, not really. Okay, so we have a thyroid gland that's located in our neck and the anterior part of our neck. That helps with our body metabolism and it helps to keep our body regulation in check. You understand? So it produces some hormones. And in that case, it looks like one of the hormones is overproduced. It means it's produced more than what it should produce. That is why it's giving some of the symptoms you've complained of today. To do for you is I'm going to carry out some investigations for you. It's first investigation is going to be the thyroid function test, which we're going to look at all the thyroid hormones to be sure if the umons actually there's an umon imbalance in the thyroid umons. Then I'm also going to do a just a thyroid scan, just look at the thyroid gland in case there's an enlargement. Although you did mention that there's no neck swelling, but it's also good to have a look at the thyroid gland. And also given the issue of the palpitations that you mentioned, that's your activity and fast, it's also safe to just look at the ECG. So just be sure that everything is going on fine there as well. So we'll carry out all these tests and given your age and I think after we do the thyroid gland, it might not be out of place to also do just an aspiration of the thyroid gland, but I think we should do the scan first and whatever the results say, we'll know what to do further from there. But pending the time, I'm going to place you on some beta blockers just so you know, relieve the palpitations that you are feeling. And then I'm also going to give you some anti-terror drugs as well. All right. All right. So I hope they're not too expensive. Oh, not at all. But I would write them out for you. Do you have any other questions? No, no, for now. But if I do, I'll definitely reach out. Okay, so if I may add, too, you know, because given the age, you're 42, it is actually very common, you know, in women at this age range. But just we can also want to rule out thyroid cancer too. Okay. So after we carry out all these tests, we'll be able to figure out what we're dealing with here. So starting with the thyroid, and then months, so do I have your go-ahead? Yes, please."," Good evening, sir. Good evening, doctor. How are you doing? I'm fine, thank you, sir.

Good afternoon doctor, good afternoon. How may I help you today? What brought you to the hospital today? Doctor, I'm not fine, I'm not fine. I've been coughing for over three months now. I've been coughing for over three months and then I started to lose weight. I noticed that one last month. Oh. So let's take it one after the other. So let's talk about the cough for a second. So you said you started coughing about three months ago, right? Yes, doctor. Okay, so I want to ask, the cough, do you cough like, is it barky first of all? Like when I say barky, I mean like the sound of a dog. Is it barky? No, doctor. I just cough, normal cough. Normal kind of cough. Okay. When you cough, do you cough like in multiple bouts? I mean, are you cough like cough, cough, cough and stop? Yeah, cough, cough, cough and stop. Or is it just like you cough once and you stop? I want to differentiate both of them. It just comes occasionally. It comes a lot, but it's not in bouts. It just comes and I cough when it comes. Okay. Alright then. So when you cough, do you produce anything in your throat? Yes. Do you produce anything in your throat? Yes. Initially, it was yellowish. It was thick. Thick mucus was coming out. It was yellowish. Then later I started noticing some reddish things inside. I don't know whether it is blood. Okay, you noticed some reddish things. First of all, you noticed it was yellowish. Then you noticed some reddish things inside the cough, inside the sputum, the phlegm you produce, right? Yes, it was yellowish at first. It was very thick, yellowish. And then later I started seeing reddish streaks amidst the yellow thickness, thickish sputum. And then I'm not sure. I think it is blood, but I'm not sure. Do you think it is blood, doctor? We'll find out. We'll find out. At the end of the question, we'll properly tie up. At the end of asking you the questions I'm asking you, I’ll be able to tie up what I think is wrong with you. So I'm still going to ask you some other further questions. So about the cough now, do you notice that you sweat a lot in the night? In this past three months, have you been sweating every day in the night? I've been sweating a lot. At first I thought it was the weather, but even when rain started falling, I sweat a lot, heavily sweating. Okay, okay. Then about the cough, since you said it's for three months, what have you done about it? What did you do about it? Did it stop at a point or you have been coughing back and forth for about three months? It has become very embarrassing that I've been coughing for so long. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. I said I've been coughing for quite a while, and it has become embarrassing. So I spoke with a couple of friends. I went to a pharmacy. I got some antibiotics. I got cough syrup. Nothing is working. Nothing is working. I'm even beginning to start losing appetite. I'm very weak. Doctor, I am sick. I am very sick. Okay, okay. No problem. Do you have any chest pain? When you cough, do you feel anything in your chest? Come again, doctor. I can't hear you. Do you feel any pain in your chest? Any chest pain when you cough? Yes, yes. Since this cough started? Yes, when I'm coughing, I feel pain in my chest. And even when I breathe in, when I'm trying to take a deep breath, I feel pain in my chest. Okay. Just to rule that out. No, no, I have not. No pain? No itching? Okay, no itching? You have not had any recent history of itching? No. Not like that, right? No, doctor. Okay, okay Fever? No, not really, not really. Not really. So, you said, back to what you said about the, that you have been sweating every night, so I'd like to probe down that area and ask you other questions. Have I noticed what? That you've lost weight, that you've lost weight in recent times Yes, I told you about, about a month ago, I started noticing, people started telling me that I've been losing weight and then I noticed that my clothes are becoming bigger. Okay, I was about to ask that, how do you, you notice that your clothes, your clothes that were bigger, that were like fitted on you before, they are now more loose, right? Yeah, they are now more loose. Okay, okay, cool. I just, I just feel tired and weak. Just feel tired and weak. Okay. Doctor yeah, what did you say? Doctor, I think I've been running temperature a bit though, although it's not, I can't, it's not really much, but for the past one month I think I've been, I've been some, some high temperature a bit, just very small. But, but any catarrh before that? Any, any catarrh before that? Any catarrh? difficulty in swallowing? No. None of that, right? No, no, none of that. Okay. Any, any back pain? Any back pain at all? No back pain. No back pain. No back pain. Okay. What kind of work do you do? And where do you work? What kind of work do you do? I'm a carpenter and I recently travelled, travelled for a job. I actually stay with a couple of people that I worked with on the job. Where, where, where, where did you travel to? Hmm? Where did you travel to? Did you travel out of your area, out of your country? Yes. What area? Where did you go to? I travelled, I travelled to India. India. All right. All right, cool. Yes. So, when you say.. where you travelled, you were in the midst of a lot of people. So, when, when, when that happened, was there anybody around you then that was coughing, that you noticed that was coughing? Yeah, yeah, I shared… some, some, some, about two people were coughing. I'm just trying to.. yes, there's a possibility. At the end of our conversation, when we are properly tied out what exactly is wrong with you then, we will know if it's from them. Because..but there's a possibility that you got it from people because of, because you were at close proximity to people that have been coughing for a long time. So, there's a chance that you got a cough right from them. So, if you don't mind, I would like to ask some other follow up questions. Yes, I've lost, I've lost appetite. Okay. And I want to ask about your.. back from...from earlier history. My immunization? I don't know. I don't know. I think I did all that when I was younger. Right, cool. No, none of that. I've been very fine until this cough. Okay. Come again? Are you married? Are you married? No, I live alone. I live alone. I'm not. Okay. While I'm asking, I want to ask if there's any recent, any history of like multiple sexual partners too, or sharing of sharps, something like that. Something that..in that regard. No, I don't. No, I don't. Have you been, have you been sharing sharps with anybody, like your clipper and stuff? I live alone and I have my clipper and everything to myself. Is there anybody in your family that has the same complaint, that has been coughing for..that you know, that has the same complaint of coughing for, for about this long? There is nobody. There is nobody. Anybody in your family? Anybody in your family? There is nobody. I'm even surprised myself, why I'm beginning to develop this cough. Now to ask you about some, some social questions. Doctor, I smoke. I smoke. So, you smoke, how many..? I only take alcohol occasionally. Okay. So, about this, about the smoking, how, how much of smoking, first of all, what do you smoke? Then what, what…how much of it do you smoke per day? I smoke cigarettes. I smoke cigarettes and I, I smoke about, about ten, ten sticks per day. Okay. All right. No, I don't. I don't know of any, any drug allergies. Okay. So, I would like to ask you some general questions about…just some general questions. Any headache, any neck pain, any neck stiffness, anything like that? None, none, none of that. Yes, that, that has been happening. Okay, noted. Then any abdominal pain, anything like that? No, no, no abdominal pain. Any constipation, no diarrhea, nothing like that? Nothing, nothing doctor. Okay. So, right now, so, at the end of our conversation, I've been able to have a list of what can be likely wrong with you right? But to properly diagnose, to like confirm, right? We need to do some investigations, right? The first thing we need to do is to do a..okay, before I, before I discuss that, I just want to just quickly examine you, right? So, examine your chest basically and listen to your, your lung fields, your right and left lung fields, right? Then, after we’re done with that, we’ll discuss about it like I’m discussing with you now. That, we’ll need to do some investigations. We will need to do.. first of all, we’ll need to do a fasting… a full blood count rather, full blood count, we’ll need to do an ESR. Alright? We’ll need to do… Okay? ESR is Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate. It’s usually a marker for acute inflammation in the body. Okay. So we’ll also need to do…and a most important thing, a chest x-ray. Because you said you have been having this cough for three months that has not… that has not stopped, even though you have taken… you have taken drugs, you have taken cough syrup and stuff and you’re still.. it’s still there, so we want to know what’s in your chest that is causing you to have this cough right? Okay, doctor. And based on what we are, what, based on what we think it is, there are also some other investigations. The cough that is productive, we need to do like a sputum…so that thing that you’re bringing out in your mouth, we want to.. like.. culture it, and since it's productive, right? So, we need to know, we want to know if there's, we want to know the bacterial cause of, of the cough, the underlying bacterial cause of the cough. I also want to do, what they call an AFB; acid-fast bacilli. It’s the test that we need to use to query what we feel is wrong with you, alongside the chest x-ray. Right? So when we put all this together and we come to the conclusion about what is wrong with you, that’s when we’ll now start you on medications. Right? So what it’s looking like is wrong with you is, we’re trying to query what we call tuberculosis right? Doctor, you think I have tuberculosis? Based on the history, based on the… we are trying to rule it out. My work as a doctor is to tie up your complaints, right? With my experience and my knowledge to be able to know which of them..which…what can be likely wrong with you. Then the investigations will now help us to point out definitive diagnosis, right? So the definitive diagnosis will be after we have done these labs that I've listed. So what's..what comes out of it is what's going to like determine our plan, right? Do you understand? Okay doctor. Do you have any, do you have anything you want to, any concern, anything? I just, I just want to be fine. No problem. At the end of..at the end of the investigations and when the result comes out, we'll, we'll, we'll know. Thank you doctor. Thank you very much. One other thing I'd like to add is the fact that we, we also want to do a gene xpert. Okay. I'm ready to do any of those. Thank you very much doctor. Yeah, no problem. No problem.",990.688,med-convo-nig,"Alright. Good afternoon, sir. Good afternoon, doctor. How may I be of service to you? Doctor, I'm not fine. No, I'm not fine.

So that you got it from people because of because you are close cause proximity people are coughing for a long time so there's a chance that you got a cough to cough right from them so if you don't mind I would like to ask some other follow up questions have you added any loss of appetite are you really noticed that recently you have not been eating like you want to eat yes I've lost I've lost appetite okay and I want to ask about your some back from some late from earlier history do you know if you are you are fully vaccinated do you have like a vaccination card to that effect do you know if you are aware of that my immunization I don't know I don't know I think I did all that when I was young I have not taken any immunization recently I don't know okay all right cool so I want to ask about if there any other complaint are you appertensive are you diabetic do you have asthma are you asthmatic I have been very fine until this cough okay just also ask and ask and are you married come again are you married are you married no I live alone I live alone I'm not why I'm asking I want to ask if there's any recent any history of like multiple sexual partners too or sharing of shops something like that in top something in that in that regards no i don't have you been shh have you been sharing shops with anybody like your clipper stuff i live alone and i have my clipper and everything to myself i have my personal stuff is there anybody in your family that has this same complaint that we are coughing for i mean i know that i have this kind of complaint of coughing for but i mean there is nobody there is nobody in your family anybody in your family there is nobody i am even surprised myself why i am developing this cough so to ask you about some social questions do you smoke do you drink alcohol do you take um about concussions any of them ah i smoke i smoke and i don't take alcohol i only take alcohol occasionally okay so about this about this smoking how much of smoking first of all what do you smoke then or what um what is how much of you smoke per day i smoke cigarettes i smoke cigarettes and i smoke about about ten sticks per day and i've been smoking for the past about ten years now okay all right all right and is there any drug that you allergic to No, I don't. I don't know of any drug allergies. So I'd like to ask you some general questions about just some general questions. Any headache, any neck pain, any neck stiffness, anything like that? No, no, none of that. Any chest pain? So you have chest pain? Any difficulty in breathing? Yes, that has been happening. I've been finding it difficult to breathe and it has been progressively worsening. That is why I had to come to the doctor because everything I have tried has not been working. So please doctor help me. No, no, no abdominal pain, anything like that. So right now, I'm so at the end of our conversation, I've been able to have a list of what can be like here with you, right? But to properly diagnose, we need to do some investigations. The first thing we need to do is to do a... Okay, before I discuss that, I just want to quickly examine you, right? Examine your chest basically and listen to your lung fields, right? Then after we're done with that, we will discuss about this, like I'm discussing with you now, that we will need to do some investigations. We need to do first of all, we need to do a fasting, a fluid count rather. We need to do an ESR, right? We need to do more support, actually. ESR is erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which is usually a marker for inflammation in the body. So we also need to do an X-ray, because you said you have been having this cough for three months that has not resolved. You are taking drugs, you are taking cough syrup and stuff. We want to know exactly what is in the chest that is causing this cough. We also want to do a sputum culture, so that we can culture it. We also want to do an AFB, acid-fast bacilli test, which is used to query what we feel is wrong with you. So when we put all this together, I will come to a conclusion about what is wrong with you. That's when we will start you on medications. So what is looking like is that we are trying to query tuberculosis, what we call tuberculosis, right? based on the we are trying to rule it out i'm not saying you have it right but the investigations we are going to do is going to make us confirm that diagnosis right my work as a doctor is to tie up your your complaints right with my experience and my knowledge to be able to know which of them which what can be like wrong with you then the investigations will not help us to point out definitive diagnosis right so the definitive diagnosis will be after we have done these labs that i've listed so what what comes out of it is what is going to like determine our plan right do you understand thank you doctor thank you very much alright one of those i like to add is the fact that we also want to do the h and g next part so those two tests okay i'm ready to get you of those thank you very much no problem no problem"," All right. Good afternoon, sir. Good afternoon, doctor. Good afternoon. How may I help you today? What brought you to the hospital today? Doctor, I'm not fine, no. I'm not fine.

Feeling like you will vomit Yes, yes, every time So do you think within this short while you've lost some weight? Yes, Doctor. When you’re not eating anything, you’ll definitely lose some weight. I think I've lost some…some kgs. OK, so um does your abdomen seem fuller or bigger than what you'd expect it to be like than normal? No, I don't think so. Okay, what about, um, pain? Are you having any pain in any part of your abdomen? No OK. You said you were weak. Um…are you having a fever or a headache? No doctor.

Um, are you passing…has the quantity or the frequency reduced compared to before? Well, I'll say a bit, and my urine is quite yellow. OK, that means…because you're not taking…Is there any pain when you’re urinating? No, I don't have any pain. OK, What about? Is there any blood stain in your urine or any… My urine is fine, doctor.

Do you…have you ever heard anything about Pap smear? Yes Doctor OK. Have you done it? Have you had it done? Yes, and It was normal OK, that's supposed to be a screening for cervical cancer. Uh, have you ever used any form of family planning in the past? Umm,no. OK um, what's…what's your…what's the nature of your cycle? Like the length of your cycle, If you see your period now, when next do you see it again? Every month, about the same day, for like 28 days. 28 days. OK, but, the bleeding lasts for how many days? By the third day, it's gone. So three days. OK, so is there any, um, is the pain, any excessive pain or bleeding during the period? OK Is there any pain when…during intercourse…when you're meeting with your husband? No OK, um..but for this current pregnancy now, Um, has there been any problems so far before this vomiting? Were you encountering any challenges? No, no problem so far. OK, so but..did you… did you…did you plan, was this pregnancy planned for and was it planned for ? were you trying to get pregnant? Yes, doctor. OK, so um, that means…but how was the pregnancy conceived? Was it IVF or you…you met your husband. How was it conceived? Naturally OK, OK. And did you, did you confirm it when you suspected you were pregnant? Yes. And so I did the urine test when I missed my period , then I also did the blood test and scan. Okay do you remember what the scan showed? I’m having twins Ohh wow. Um, OK but OK um what about the movements? Throughout this period, how has the movement of the…the movement in your abdomen been? has it been reduced or how has it been, the movement of your baby? Well, I just started feeling the movements not quite long, so not so strong, but I still felt it like 30 minutes ago But in your first pregnancy, did you experience anything like this? No, like I said, Doctor, it was very, very, very smooth, or is it because I'm having twins? OK, so, sometimes um, the symptoms can be aggravated when you're having multiple gestation. But then again, let's…we'll get…we'll try to understand why you're feeling that way okay? OK. Are you…Is there any chronic illness that you're taking medications for…treating, such as hypertension, diabetes or ulcer? Peptic ulcer? No, yeah Doctor, in my first pregnancy, I actually remember, early in that pregnancy, I felt somehow like…but it was not for long. What’s that? like I had some vomiting in my previous pregnancy too OK, OK. But it was not for long, right? Yes. Have you had any blood transfusions in the past? No, Doctor What about surgeries? Umm,no I’ve not had any surgery. OK, What about… is there any family history of this kind of vomiting or any pregnancy complications in your family? Yeah, my mum had like, history of…she had surgery for…they said that her pregnancy at one time was ectopic. OK, OK. That was your mother, you said? yes, my mom, she told me. OK OK I don't smoke and I have not been taking alcohol in this pregnancy. But before I got pregnant, I used to drink wine like every week. Okay, how many…how many glasses do you estimate you take per day or per week? Just two glasses per week just to…just to relax OK, so your…you live with your…with your husband. That means from what you said, you have a child, so that means it's you, your husband and your child. Yes, and my 2 year old. So are you taking any drugs currently? Yeah, I'm taking the normal pregnancy drugs- folic acid and Bco. OK? Um do you have any allergies, any drug allergies that you want us to know about? No Doctor Doctor what are you going to do for me? All this story, I'm getting tired. OK, I'm. I'm sorry about that. The questions are important so I would know how to…how to approach what you're experiencing currently. OK, so from all indications now, we would want to address this vomiting. When you're having excessive vomiting like this, the term…medical term for it is hyperemesis. So hyperemesis gravidarum, OK? Now, and hyperemesis gravidarum can make you lose a lot of fluid, you’ll become weak, it can affect you. It can also affect the baby because you're losing a lot of fluid that should ideally be there for your use and that of the baby. Do you understand? Yes OK so hyperemesis gravidarum is the most likely diagnosis and even having twins can predispose you to that. It's one of the causes. Um,so, we would want to…I would want you to do run some investigations. Can you hear me? Yes doctor Yes, so we want to run some investigations, Um, I want you to do a full blood count. We want to also check your electrolytes because you're vomiting and you're losing a lot of electrolytes. So we want to check your electrolytes then we would also want to do um, we want to also just do a urinalysis. That's just routine, because we want to know…because even if you're having a UTI that was not symptomatic, you still also vomit. So those are three possible things. Then we want to also do an abdominopelvic scan to see the…to be sure that your babies are doing fine. Do you understand? OK Doctor But most importantly now, I want you to…we would want you to be hydrated. So um, since this is more of umm…you would need, you’ll need to get fluid as soon as possible, do you understand? So since this is more of a…on a telemedicine basis, I want you to quickly…you will have to go somewhere where you will get fluid administered to you immediately, the nearest place to where you are right now, because you can't stay for so long without fluid, do you understand? OK. So please if you…if you have anyone with you at home there, you can just let them know they should quickly take you to the nearest facility beside you so you can have…you can get some fluid rushed as soon as possible. OK so do you have any other questions for me? um I don't have, I just need to get my strength back first and be sure that my babies are fine. OK, OK so please I'll need you to uh quickly do that. You will also most likely be placed on anti-emetics too so that…and it depends on the severity, you might…they might also want to admit you so but I think you should just actually immediately present to where you would be given...you’ll be given fluid as soon as possible. OK? OK Doctor I hope that will be all? Yes. So I’ll just go to the hospital now. Alright. So, um, have a nice day okay? And I wish you quick recovery Thank you.",965.248,med-convo-nig,"Good morning, doctor. May I know your name and your age, ma'am? My name is Dura. I'm 36 years old. How can I help you today?

Okay. What are you going to do for me? All this story, I'm getting tired. Okay, I'm sorry about that. The questions are important, so I would know how to approach what you're experiencing currently. Okay, so from all indications now, would you want to address this vomiting? When you're having excessive vomiting like this, the term, medical term for it is hyperemesis gravidarum. Okay. And it's just vomiting in excess because most pregnant women experience vomiting in moderate conditions. Like you said, you used to experience vomiting, but it wasn't as much as this. Now, and hyperemesis gravidarum can make you lose a lot of fluid, you become weak, it can also affect you, it can also affect the baby because you're losing a lot of fluid that should ideally be there for your use and that of the baby. Do you understand? Yes. Okay. So hyperemesis gravidarum is the most likely diagnosis, and even having twins can predispose you to that. It's one of the causes. Now, um, If other things that might make you vomit excessively like this could be a GI infection, although you said you were already having a fever, right? But having an infection in your GI can make you vomit like it can make you throw up as many times as well. So we want to run some investigations. Can you hear me? Yes, doctor. Yes.

OK, yes. so it basically just means…like…there's like a defect around your groin and some parts of your intestine pops in through there and sometimes when you lie down, it pops back in. Yes, yes. I think that makes sense. Yeah, so it's quite common. And then…and then I would most likely be referring you to the general surgeon so that you're being evaluated. Yes, yes, I'm with you. Yes, so…yeah so…so far it seems like an uncomplicated hernia because sometimes we could have complications like strangulation of the intestine that pops out through that defect. But you don't have abdominal pain or anything like that. So basically, I would just like to do some basic investigation like some blood work, like a full blood count, just to check your blood level and all. Yes, that's OK, yes, yes. But if you have any complaints like abdominal pain, vomiting before the review, please do come back to the hospital. Alright Alright, do you have any questions? No, I…I don't. As long as I'll get better when I see the surgeon. Alright. Thank you very much. Thank you, Doctor. Alright. Have a nice day.",607.886125,med-convo-nig,"Hello sir. Hello doctor. Good morning.

So, OK, so you stay alone. You're not here in an overcrowded place. Yes, but yes. But Doctor, I noticed. What actually prompted me to come is the fact that about two days ago I noticed that the cough became worsened, and I was… I started to have some difficulty in breathing. So, like that got me really scared, like I was, I was, I was just feeling breathless for a moment. Comes and goes then, and since that, since then, the breathlessness has become more worsened. So that's what exactly prompted me to completely to see you. You're finding it difficult to breathe, Yes, Yes When you sleep at night, you sweat excessively. No, at all.

No, it's not associated with erm, any… any position, nothing. I just… it just comes and goes, like I just feel breathless for a while, then it relieves me. Then it comes again, especially when I'm especially when I'm coughing. OK. Has this worsened progressively? Yes, Yes… It has gotten very bad, doctor, that's why I came to the hospital. Does it affect, does it affect your daily activities? Yes, it does, doctor. I've not been able to work for the past two days because of the cough and the fact that I have, I've not been feeling well, generally in my body, so that's so, Now this fever that you were having, was it… did it start suddenly or gradually? It started. It started gradually, then became I became very hot and it has been like that, it has been like that. So, the fever is high grade, You're very hot? Yes… Yes, it's high. Did you at any point? Yes. Check by yourself at home your temperature? Yes, I did… I did, I have a thermometer, it was about was about 38.9. 38.9 OK and what does… what do you do that relieves the fever. I took some, I took some paracetamol. It relieved a bit, then but it did… didn't last long. I just I I became hot again and it has been like that ever since. So I just want to ask you some questions. Has anything happened before in the past? OK, Has it happened in the past? No, no, no, no. This is the first time I'm experiencing, that's why I'm… this is the first time I'm experiencing this kind of thing. OK, this is the first time. Are you.. do you have any medical condition? Like, are you asthmatic during your blood group and genotype? No, I'm not doctor, I'm fine. No, I have nothing. And that’s why this is Surprising. Are you hypertensive? What did you say? I can't hear you properly, Sir. Are you hypertensive or diabetic? None. None. None. None No, no. I have none of them… I have none of them. So, what have you... what have you done to care for yourself so far? I just… I just… I just tried to get some cough syrup, but they didn't… They didn't seem to work properly. They didn't seem to work and since the difficulty breathing started, I knew, I knew, I know I needed to like, come to speak to someone, to a doctor. So, that's why I came today, for you to like, for me to like, know what's wrong with me and treat myself, basically. Have you been, have you been admitted before? No, not, not, not that I can remember. Have you done any surgical procedure before? No, No. OK. So, I'm just going to ask you some other questions just to know what exactly could be related to your, to the symptoms you're having. So, do you have headache? Headache just comes once in a while, maybe 'cause the cough. I've not been able to sleep really. So, kind of, yeah, kind of, yes. OK. So, any loss of consciousness? No. No. No, No. OK, OK.

It's just, it's just the shortest of breath I've been having. The difficulty in breathing I've been having. That's just, that's just… So, in summary you're telling me, in summary you're telling me you had, you… you've had cough, fever and difficulty in breathing. Yes. Right and your cough is productive. Yes. All right, So I'm going to have to have to examine you, right. I'm going to have to examine you and I'm going to have to listen to your chest to know if, to know whatever is going on in your chest, whether there's a chest infection that is causing you to have a fever and the and the cough. Do you understand? And then we are going to have you do some investigations like a chest X-ray, a complete blood count, a full blood count which will tell us whether there's an infection going on, depending on the parameters that are elevated or reduced, do you understand? We are going to do you know, electrocyte segmentation rates to know whether there's an inflammatory process going on. Do you understand? And then we're also going to take your sputum, your… the phlegm and we're going to send it for culture, sensitivity to know what bacteria is, is being cultured. Erm, please, I just want to ask you, do you smoke? No. No, I don't, doctor, I'm a good Christian. I don’t smoke. I don't drink. You don't… You don't drink alcohol either. I don't, I don't do any of those, I don't do drugs, I don't do any of that. I'm going to ask you some other questions. Do you have… their kind of personal questions? Can I go ahead? Yeah. I just want to know, doctor, I just want to… I just want to be fine. I just want to know how soon you can start treating me and what I’ll need to take basically. I just want to ask if…I just want to ask if you have multiple sexual partners and then your sexual practices. No, no. You have oral sex? I'm married. No, not at all. Not at all. I'm married. So, we are going to start you, from the history and the examination we have done and then we're going to ask you to do some investigations. However, we have some differentials like diagnosis, the cause, the cause of what is causing the cough and the fever. We have some, this thing at the back of our mind, which could be the cause. Do you understand? We think you have a pneumonia, pneumonia, a chest infection. So, we're going to start you on a broad spectrum antibiotics, right? And then we're going to start you on the cough syrup, right, to treat the cough while we wait for the results of our investigations. Do you understand? OK And then since there's no history of asthma by the time you'll start treatment with the antibiotics and… and the cough syrup there will be… the breathlessness is going to reduce. But we… your... we would have checked your… your oxygen saturation and we'll see that it is fine. So, there'll be no need to place you on… on oxygen. So, you're going to have you do a full blood count in sputum and microscopy culture sensitivity. You're going to have you do any Erythrocyte segmentation rate and you're going to do a chest X-ray. So, let's see if it's a structural problem or a functional problem. Do you understand? OK, doctor. So doctor, do I.. Do you want to ask the question if you have any questions, Yes, I was going to ask that are you going to keep me in the hospital or do I… that… can I… can I be treated from home? Because I don't know. We, we, we are going to admit you for some time to evaluate you and because of the breathlessness you are having, right. And then we'll start you on on intravenous, intravenous… erm That's OK. That's cool. Culture and sensitivity could take about 72 hours to.. to five days before it will be ready. Do you understand?

Let's say 0 is the fact that you're not having pain at all and 10 is the worst pain of your life, what would you grade this pain you're feeling between 0 and 10? So, let me see.

It's not like I have any. What did you say? Is there any swelling? At all. That's what I was even trying to explain to you like I was… I was wondering how the pain, what was causing the pain. There is no swelling at all in my knee. Now, it's not swelling and I'm not feeling the pain any part of my knee it's just my knee. Was there at any point that you… you had an injury on that side of the leg? No at all. I never had any… any injury or any accident or any former… none none of nothing, nothing like that.

Do you feel stiffness in the, in the, in that in your knee? Not really, not really, Just… Just the sharp pain, especially when I try to walk. When I try to use the knee You don't feel stiffness, you don't feel stiffness in your knee in the morning when you wake up? No No after you sit for a while, after you immobilize the leg for a while, and you're not using the leg, the knee for a while, when you try to stand up from a chair, do you feel some stiffness or serious pain in the leg? Yes, I Yeah, I feel, I feel something like that, Yes. When you're sleeping at night, do you feel pain in the leg? No, No. OK, has this pain occurred before on that same part of the leg or in any other part of your body? Not at all, not at all. I have no pain and I don't feel any pain. I feel good in other part of my body but it's just for that and the leg, the pain… the pain in my knee, it was just recently. Before then I was I was OK, I was fine. When, when you're walking do you hear some cracky sounds when you're walking? Sometimes I… I think I've had one of my because I'm I'm about 60 year old so I think one of my children told me months that kind of heard something like that when I when I walked past him, I don't know but I've, I've not really felt something like that, but I think about someone say something like that about it. The range of the range of movement of your joint, is it still the same? Are you in any way limited in the range of your… of the movement of your joint? Yes, yes, because of the pain, yes OK, no problem. Erm, I will just ask you some questions. Are you diabetic or hypertensive? No, I'm not. Do you have any medical condition that you think the doctor showed know about? No. Do you have the, have you had any previous surgeries? Yeah, Yeah. Erm, just about.. just the appendectomy I had about 30 years ago. 30 Years ago. OK, Do you smoke or drink alcohol? I used to when I was much younger. I used to smoke, used to smoke, but I stopped smoking and I take alcohol once in a while. What kind of alcohol do you take? Do you take beer or… or spirits or whiskey? I take, I take more of beer. You take more of beer. OK, OK. So like, how many bottles do you take per day? I’m, I'm a social drinker. I only take, I only take alcohol on like social events just once in a while. No, no, no problem. Is there any fever? Not at all. Not at all. OK, no problem. Do you have any drug allergies? I only react, I only react to a particular type of antibiotics, to penicillin. I was told yes. That's all… React to Penicillins. OK, there is no problem. Is there anything else you want the doctor to know about? Doctor, other than my knee, I'm fine. I just want to know what's wrong with my knee and to get a proper solution to it Just to, just to have an holistic, holistic erm… erm… assessment of of my patients. I'd like to ask some other questions. So I want to ask you, do you have headaches? Any loss of consciousness? Not at all. OK, Do you have chest pain? No. At all. Any difficulty in breathing? No. Do you hear your heart beat fast? Not at all. Do you have any abdominal pain? Abdominal pain? No, No. Yes. No at all. Yeah, Any diarrhea? No. OK Do you have pain when you want to urinate or difficulty urinating? No. No, doctor. No. OK Are there times that you see crystals in your urine? When you say crystal, what do you mean by crystal, doctor? Like, like some stones. Small, small, small stones in your urine. I think I, recent… sometime ago, yes, I saw something that looks like what you describe, but I wasn't sure what it was. So,  I thought it is because I didn't take enough water. So, I think I took more water and I've not seen it in a while. So, but I think I remember seeing something like what you described once. There's no problem. So I'm going to go ahead and do a general examination on you just to check your if your pale, to check if you're jaundiced, to check if you're well hydrated, to check your lymph nodes. And then I'm also going to specially examine your… your knee to know the exact cause of the pain you're having to see if there's anything we can pick up that will help us in your management for this knee pain that you're having, do you understand? So, it will involve us examining the knee, moving the knee might make you a bit uncomfortable because of the pain you're having there. We want to see whether there's a swelling, whether there's a increase in the warmth of that place compared to your other knee, because I want to see whether it's tender, that is, it's it's very painful on on on pressing it, or whether the pain is only there when you want to move. And we also want to see if there's any cracking sound when we move the joints. Do you understand? So we think it could be an osteoarthritis which means the wear and tear of the joints of the knee which will now start causing pain with that. And then because of your history of drinking beer and then history of passing some stones in your urine, you think you could have also have a gouty arthritis in your in your knee. So we're going to run some investigations to to know the exact cause and the management to to put in place. We are going to need to do an X-ray of that leg, of the leg, lhat will involve seeing both joints, the joints above and the joints below, right. And then we are also going to request for some other blood tests like a complete blood count, a full block count to see if it's an effective process which could be a septic arthritis. And then we also need to do the erythrocyte sedimentation rates to show us whether there's an, it's an inflammatory process going on. It could be elevated in an inflammatory process and then we'll do a uric acid test. So, you know if your uric acid level is high which could be a sign of a guilty arthritis. Do you understand and after after the investigations we are going to start you, we are going to start you on some drugs to relieve your pain, but the main, mainstay of the treatment is going to be non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, I wanted to ask earlier, but do you have ulcer, are you a known peptic ulcer disease patients, No not at all OK because some of the drugs that we are going to give you could… could exacerbate peptic ulcer disease. So, we're going to give you some non steroidal anti inflammation drugs like ibuprofen, we can give you diclofenac, do you understand? And then we are going to give you some gel that you can apply topically for pain relief gel that you can apply topically that will help relieve the pain. All in all, if it's osteoarthritis where it's caused by wear and tear, you have to limit the usage of of that joint because the more you use the joint the more the wear and tear happens. There are other modalities of treatment, but it depends on the progression and how bad the, the knee, The knee is. Do you understand? it could involve replacement of the knee but depending on grade on how, of the osteoarthritis, do you understand what I'm saying? And then if it's a gouty arthritis would have to start you on some other drugs that would reduce the level of uric acid in your in your system and also relieve your… your pain. Do you understand? So that is that is what we're going to do. Do you have any questions for me, Sir? All right. So after all this is done, the pain, my pain, will… will it be, will it… Will it go away or do I have to live with this for the rest of my life or I don't, I'm trying to understand what, what is what, What is the prognosis of this going forward? If it is, if it is a, if it is the osteoarthritis. Like I said earlier, it's wear and tear. Do you understand? So the pain will come, but whenever you use your, your drugs, it's going to go away. It's going to go away for some time, but you might have to be on those drugs for some time. Do you understand? if it's a guilty arthritis. If you're uric acid level in the body is low, the pain is going to go and then will also treat you with the with the pain relief. But you have to stay away from… from some things like stop eating offals, you reduce the amount of beer you take. If you can stop fine. Do you understand? but we'll give you some drugs that will lower the level of your uric acid. Do you understand? So that is the modality of treatment for for it. Any other questions? Oh, I think that's fine. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much for your time.",924.256,med-convo-nig,"Good afternoon, sir. My name is Dr. Shadekar. How may I help you? Yeah, good afternoon, doctor. Yeah, my name is Mr. James. Right, so I came to see you today because I have, yes, I have a complaint, right?

I've been having, affecting me from walking about doing my daily activities. So I just say, let me come see you, doctor. When it starts playing you? No at all. It's just my knee. So you mean whenever you move or stretch your knee, the pain is aggravated? Yeah, yeah, yes, yes, yes. So what else do you think aggravates the pain? The pain also, I noticed that from, like over the day, from morning until like midday, the pain becomes progressively worse, like it comes to worst. Like if you feel the pain more towards afternoon than it was in the morning, something like that, yes. So after you go about your daily activities and do your normal activities, the pain in your right knee increases. Yes, it increases, yes. So what do you do to relieve the pain when it comes? Because we've been playing for about two weeks now. I don't do anything about it. I don't do anything about it at all. Okay, so if you're going to grade this pain, talking about the severity of the pain, they're going to grade the pain. Let's say zero is the fact that you're not having pain at all, and ten is the worst pain of your life. What would you grade this pain you're feeling between zero and ten? So let me see. So I will give it like a six out of ten, about six out of ten, yes. Six out of ten. Okay. And the pain has progressively worsened. Yes. That's what I was saying, yes. And it's not like I have any swelling or anything. Is there any swelling? No at all. That's what I was trying to explain. I was wondering how the pain was. There's no swelling at all in my knee. I just noticed it recently. It was about two weeks ago. What is your weight, please? I think I'm about 70 kg. Last time I checked. I'm not really sure about my height.

When you're sleeping at night, do you feel pain in the leg? No, no. Has this pain occurred before on that same part of the leg or in any other part of the body? Not at all. Not at all. I have no pain. I don't feel any pain. I feel good in that part of my body. But it's just the fact that and the deep pain in my knee. It was just recently. Before then I was okay. I was fine. When you're walking, do you hear some crackly sounds when you're walking? Sometimes. I think I've had one of my, because I'm about 60 years old, so I think one of my children told me months that kind of at something like that when I walked past him, I don't know. So I think I've about once said something like that about it. The range of movement of your joints is it still the same? Are you in any way limited in the range of your movement of your joints? Yes, yes, because of the pain. No problem. I would just ask you some questions. Are you diabetic or hypertensive? No, I'm not. Do you have any medical condition that you think the doctor should know about? No. Do you have any previous surgeries? Yes, about 30 years ago. Do you smoke or drink alcohol? I used to smoke when I was much younger, but I stopped smoking. I take alcohol once in a while. What kind of alcohol do you take? Do you take beer or spirits or whisky? I take more beer. I take more beer. How many bottles do you take per day? I drink socially, I drink on social events, just once in a while. No problem. Is there any fever? Not at all. Not at all. Okay, no problem. Do you have any drug allergies? I'll leave that. Are you reacting to a particular type of antibiotics? Penicillins? I was told yes, that's all. Are you allergic to penicillins? Okay, there is no problem. Is there anything else you want the doctor to know about? Just to have an holistic assessment of my patients. I like to ask some other questions. Do you have headaches? No. Do you have chest pain? No. Any difficulty in breathing? No. Do you hear your heart beats fast? No. Do you have any abdominal pain? No. Any diarrhea? No. Do you have pain when you want to urinate or difficulty urinating? No. Are there times that you see crystals in your urine? When you say crystals, what do you mean by crystals? Like some stones? Small small stones in your urine. I was saying some time ago yes, I saw something that looked like what you described but I wasn't sure what it was so I thought it was because I didn't take enough water so I think I took on water and I have not seen it again so but I think I remember seeing something like what you described once so I'm going to go ahead and do a general examination on you just to check your if you are jaundiced, to check if you are well hydrated, to check your lymph nodes and then I'm also going to specially examine your knee to know the exact cause of the pain you are having. Do you understand? So it will involve us examining the knee, moving the knee might make you a bit uncomfortable because of the pain you are having there. We want to see whether there is swelling, whether there is an increase in the amount of that place compared to your other knee. I want to see whether it is tender, whether it is very painful on pressing it or whether the pain is only there when you want to move. And we will also want to see if there is any cracking sound when we move the joint. Do you understand? So we think it could be an osteoarthritis which means the wear and tear of the joints of the knees which will now start causing pain with that and then because of your history of drinking beer and then history of passing some stones in your urine, we think you could also have a gouty arthritis. in your knee. So we're going to run some investigations to know the exact cause and the management to put in place.

It could be elevated in an inflammatory process and then we will do a uric acid test to know if your uric acid level is high, which could be a sign of gouty arthritis. Do you understand? And after after the investigations we are going to start you on some drugs to relieve your pain. But the main treatment is going to be non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. I wanted to ask earlier about do you have also are you in any other patient of this patient? OK, because some of the drugs are going to give you cold, could exacerbate peptic ulcer disease. So we are going to give you some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that you are able to fill. I can give you diclofenac, do you understand? And they are going to give you some gel that you can apply topically. Some pain relief gel that you can apply topically. that would help relieve the pain. Only no, um, if it's at osteoarthritis, we are it's caused by wear and tear, you have to limit the usage of of that joint because the more you use the joints, the more the wear and tear happens. There are other modalities of treatment, but it depends on the progression and how bad the knee, the knee is, you know, it could involve replacement of the knee, but depending on the grade of the osteoarthritis, do you understand what I'm saying? And then if it's a gouty arthritis, we have to start you on some other drugs that would reduce the level of uric acid in your system and also relieve your pain, do you understand? So that is, that is what we are going to do. Do you have any questions for me, sir? All right, so after all this is done, um, depending on my pain, will it be, will it be, will it go away or do I have to live with this for the rest of my life? I don't, I'm trying to understand what, what is, what is the prognosis of this going forward? If it is, if it is a, if it is the osteoarthritis, like I said earlier, it's wear and tear, do you understand? So the pain will come, but whenever you use your, your drugs, it's going to go away and it's going to go away for some time, but you might have to be on those drugs for some time. Do you understand? Maybe it's a gouty arthritis, if your, if you can see the level in the body, you know, the pain is going to grow, and they will also treat you with the, with the perilesion, but you have to stay away from some things like stop eating offal, you reduce the amount of beer you take. If you can stop, fine. Do you understand? I will give you some drugs that will lower the level of uric acid. Do you understand? So that is the modality of treatment for uric acid. Any other question, comments? I think that's fine. Thank you, doctor. Thank you very much for your time."," Good afternoon, sir. My name is Dr. Shadeko. How may I help you? Good afternoon, doctor. My name is Mr. James. I came to see you today because I have a serious aching it's aching and it was the pain was very small before but as as time went on it became much more much more your normal activities the pain in your right knee increases yes it increases yes so what do you do to relieve the pain when it comes because we have been playing for about two weeks now i don't i don't i don't do anything about it i not like i have any swelling or not is there any swelling it's not like i have any what did you say is there any swelling no at all that's what i was trying to explain to you like i was i was wondering how the pain what i was putting the pain there's no swelling at all in my knee no it's not swelling and i'm not feeling the pain any part of my knee it kg. Thank you. And your height? Do you know your height? I'm not really sure about my height, to be honest. I'm not really sure about my height. But I know I'm not... When you wake up in the leg yes i yeah i feel i feel something like that yes when you're sleeping at night do you feel pain on the leg no no has this pain occurred before on that same part of your leg or in any other part of your body not movement of your joints yes yes because of the pain yes okay no problem um uh i'll just ask you some questions are you diabetic or hypertensive no i'm not do you have any medical i mean i'll drink i'll take i'll take a call on like social events just once in a while no problem is there any fever not at all not at all okay, do you have headaches? Yes. Any loss of consciousness? Not at all, doctor. Okay. Do you have chest pain? No, at all. Any difficulty in breathing? No. Do you hear your heart beat fast? Not at all, doctor. Do you have any abdominal pain? Sometimes you go, yes, I saw something that looked like what you described, but I wasn't sure what it was. I thought it was because I didn't take enough water. So I think I took on water and I have not seen it anymore. So I think I remember seeing something like what you described once. So I'm going to go ahead and do a only there when you want to move and we also want to see if there's any cracking sound when we move the joints do you understand right so we think it could be an osteoarthritis uh which means the. And then we'll do a uric acid test to know if your uric acid level is high, which could be a sign of a gouty arthritis. Do you understand? And after the investigations, we are going to start you on some drugs to relieve your pain only know um if it's at osteoarthritis where it's caused by reality you have to limit the usage of of that joints because the more you use the joints the more the reality happens there are other going to go away. And it's going to go away for some time, but you might have to be on those drugs for some time. Do you understand? If it's a gouty arthritis, if you're, you can see the level in the body is low, the pain is going to go. And they will also treat you with the peri-lipo. You have to stay away from some things like this."

Good morning, Sir. Good Morning, Good Morning, doctor. Yes, Sir. How are you doing today And how can we help you today? I'm not fine. My daughter is not fine, So I'm not fine. So what's…what's wrong with her? She started running temperature yesterday, started running temperature yesterday and then I checked, I checked the temperature it was, it was about 38.1°C at home and then today she…she started jerking her arms and her legs. So the complaint, so the complaint is the fever and the jerking of the hands and legs. So when the fever started, was it like low grade? I just noticed that her body was, her body was very hot. It was very hot. So I decided to check with my thermometer at home and it was 38.1. OK, 38.1 OK. Did you did you use any…was there anything you did that like, brought the fever down? Did you give her anything at all to bring the fever down? I...I know that we needed, we needed to like clean her body with water. So still on the fever, I'll like to ask you other few questions. She was not coughing. She was not coughing at any point. She was not coughing. OK, alright cool. Did you notice any discharge from her ear or from her nose or her eyes, anything like that at all? I have not noticed anything. OK, OK cool. She…she never gave any complaints like that. Although, she…she really does not have appetite now because she's not been eating well since the fever started. She's not been eating well. She never complained of…of pain in her throat when… OK, is there…OK that's fine. There was no vomiting at all. There was no vomiting. OK, Did you notice that she was passing any loose stool? Was she going to the toilet frequently and was passing loose stool? Anything like that? She…the only thing that I noticed was that she usually cries when she wants to Asides that, she was not stooling she was not vomiting. I don't know what is going on, doctor. OK, cool, cool. I was getting to that too. I don't know if she feels pain, but she says she's usually crying, usually crying when she wants to urinate, Alright. Usually…usually…usually for her age, usually in children that like, cannot properly express emotions, so, most of the time…most of the time…most of the time, when a child is crying, when she pees, it's most likely due to pain, right? OK. You think the…the pain she's feeling what is causing that fever? So I'm…I'm…I'm getting to it. I'm getting to it. OK. Okay, so the jerky movement, right? Everything was fine. Everything was fine. like how long, how long did it last for? Like how long did you see that… It lasted about…lasted about 3 minutes or thereabout. OK, cool It only happened once, it only happened once immediately afterwards, I brought her immediately to the hospital to see the doctor. OK, cool, Beautiful. So it happened just once, right. I'm as shocked, 'cause this is the first time I'm seeing something like this happen. OK, OK, All right, All right, cool. Yes, She's my first daughter, yes First daughter, and I make sure that she gets all her  immunization. I don't know,  what's going on. You said she…she has…erm immunization. Yes, I have the card, I make sure I take her to get all the immunization. And when she was younger, there was… She had no complications… when she was, when she was there, when she was… when she was newly delivered, like, you know, during her like her first one month or after she was…after… after delivery, there wasn't…She had no, like any type of yellowness of the eyes. No, there was, there was nothing, nothing like that. There was nothing, everything was fine. And she did not have she… And she cried immediately after birth, or it took a while for that to happen? She cried immediately. OK. OK. All right. Cool. Nothing, Nothing at all. Her pregnancy and antenatal, everything was fine, she delivered by herself. OK and she delivered herself, right? Yes OK. OK So, erm OK, so cool from the…everything I've asked you right now… And how old is your daughter, too, by the way? Just to be sure She …I said she’s 3… She's 3. She's 3 years old. Alright, so from everything I've asked you, OK, three. Doctor, her own lasted…her own lasted about 3 minutes. So you mean she was convulsing? Yes she had an episode of convulsion but was a single…it was a singular episode and the cause of…and the cause of the…of the convulsion is due to some bacterial infection that manifested as fever. So that's what brings us to the complaints about her having the…having… crying when she was peeing. So the focus of the fever could come from like the urinary tract infection. So in this case, to properly investigate and get to the root of the matter, to properly treat her, right. So she would need to do some basic investigations, the first things first in this case of fever is to do a full blood count. I hope…I hope she is not going to have another convulsion before then, ‘cause I am really scared. No No No…Based on, based on the fact that…based on…based on everything I've asked you, no, don't worry, she’ll be fine. how are we going to take care of the convulsion now? ‘cause I’m really scared No, so as soon as the results of the… of the labs we do is out, so we'll... we'll just try and treat the UTI, we'll place her on antibiotics, right. So, the antibiotics will take care of the urinary tract infection. But you said the result will take about 72 hours, that's like 3 days. no, first… so the…the result of the urinalysis too, if the…if we…if we can pick out any positive from the urinalysis, we can start her on some erm… some antibiotics first, pending the time the urine MCS comes out right. But her temperature is still quite high. I just… I still checked recently before… before coming. Yeah. Yeah. We also take care of that. We'll give… we'll give her antipyretics for that. You're sure she's going to be fine? Yes, she'll be fine for sure, for sure. Then, I hope this is not going to happen again What did you say? I can't hear you properly, I hope it’s not going to happen again it's…so far…the thing is, so far the causative organism, so far the cause, the cause is not in play, then it will likely not happen again. Doctor, I try my possible best to do that. As you know urinary tract infections are ubiquitous. No problem, Doctor. Thank you very much. I really appreciate your help.",774.816,med-convo-nig,"Good morning, sir. Good morning, doctor. Yes, sir. How are you doing today? And how are you coming? We are up to date. I'm not fine. My daughter is not fine. I am not fine. So what is wrong with that? I can see her with that. So what is wrong with that? What's the complaint exactly? She started running temperature yesterday. She started running temperature yesterday. And then I checked. I checked the temperature. It was about 38.1. It was about 38.1. She was still very out of it this morning. So still only a few hours. So that few questions. So was she coughing at any point? She was not coughing. She was not coughing at any point. Did you notice any discharge from her ear or nose or eyes, anything like that at all? I have not noticed anything. Okay. Did you, have you ever complained to you that she had some pain when she was swallowing? She never gave any complaints like that. Although she really did not have a good appetite now because she was not eating well since the fever started. She never complained of pain in her throat. When you? Okay. Okay. Did she in the miss in the air around after this fever, did she vomit? Any vomiting at all? There was no vomiting at all. Okay. Did you notice that she was passing any loose stool? Was she going to be toilet frequently? I was passing loose stool. Anything like that? The only thing that I noticed was that she usually cries when she wants to pee. She is only crying. I said that she was not too sick. I don't know what is going on, doctor. Okay. Cool. Cool. I was getting to that too. Now, you said she was having, when she goes to pee, she feels pain and when she pees, right? I don't know if she feels pain or not, but she says she's usually crying. Usually, usually for her age, usually in children that cannot properly express emotion. So most of the time, most of the time, most of the time, when a child is crying, when she pees, it's most likely due to pain. And based on what you have been telling me since, I'm like, the picture is making more sense. So I'd like to ask you a few questions. Okay, okay, so the pain she's feeling is what is causing the fever? So I'm getting to it. I'm getting to it. So absolutely, absolutely. You mind me asking some other few questions from you? Okay, okay, so the jerking movement, right? Can you describe it for me? How did it look like? Everything was fine. Everything was fine. I just went to do something and then I came back. I saw her moving her arms and her legs in folding it for a couple of minutes. It lasted about three minutes. I like how long? How long did it last for? Like how long? It lasted about three minutes or thereabouts. And then after that was okay. And the last time since in the last few hours, how many times has it happened? How many times has she had that jerking movement? How many times have you? Afterwards, I brought her immediately to the hospital. Doctor. Okay, cool. Beautiful. So you happened just one, right? And as this. As this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this as this like that nothing nothing at all a pregnancy and it's not that everything was fine and she delivered by herself and she delivered herself right yes so everything I've asked you right now and how was your daughter too by the way she's three she's three she's three years old alright so everything I've asked you right I have a picture of what's my urinary tract infection. So in this case to properly investigate and get the root of the matter to properly treat that right so if you need to do some basic investigations the first thing first in this case of fever is to do a full blood count. Full blood count is like a complete body workup that shows if there's any ongoing systemic infection right then the other thing to properly point out to the UTI to that we can that what I'm kind of trying to I'm querying as a cause of the fever is the fact that we need to also do a urine analysis right you do analysis and also do you need to do a urine mcs mcs means microcopical culture and The of the labs we do is out so we'll let us try and treat the u. t. l. we'll play some antibiotics right so antibiotics will take care of the united track. So the result of the analysis to if the if you if you if you can pick out any positive on analysis we can start out on some um some antibiotics first pending the time the um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um the general um um medical advice to make sure that she's eating well um just like properly be healthy um but proper general hygiene basically yeah but i i try my possible best to do that my my child is always healthy i feed her well when it is time she eats three times a day she has snacks in between so i don't know i make sure she washes and around often so how how could she have gotten the um um infection an infection you know as you know united states infections are ubiquitous everywhere and we got seen anyway so if if there's a drop in your but your body immune system right so they does multiply and they take over it like the general system so just basically basic hygiene science case since the cause is from a uti so personal hygiene make sure that she the she's properly taking care of herself or she's quite taking care of in that area basically so in case of personal hygiene and stuff no problem doctor thank you very much i really appreciate your"," Okay. Good morning, sir. Good morning. Good morning, doctor. Yes, sir. How are you doing today? And how's the way of did you give anything at all to bring it i i i know that we needed to like i when she swallows she she never gave any complaints like that although she she really don't have appetite now because she's not been eating well since the fever started she's not been eating well she never complained of of um Usually for her age, usually in children, they cannot properly express emotions. So most of the time, most of the time, most of the time, when a child is crying, when she pees, it's mostly likely due to pain, right? And based on what you have been telling me since, I'm like, the picture is making more sense to me. So I'd like to long did that last about about three minutes or thereabouts it was for quite a while and then afterwards okay cool and in the last since in the last 24 hours how many times has it happened how many times has she had that jakey movement afterwards like a cat like him yes and when she was younger that was she had no complications when she was when she was fine she delivered by herself okay she delivered herself right yes okay all right so um so cool so was a singular episode. And the cause of the convulsion is due to some bacterial infection that manifested as a fever. and subsequently the concussion that she had usually that's one the analysis is like an immediate care of the urinary tract.

No Have you gotten pregnant at all? No. No, not at all. OK, so how about your husband? How frequently have you both been having sex? Since we got married, me and my husband, we can meet, like, four times in a week. We have intercourse about three to four times average, every week.

And sometimes with space there will be space, sometimes it's every day like that. All right, so are you the only wife for your husband, to your husband? rather I'm the only one who married.

All right. So, have you noticed any neck swelling recently? No. Do you notice whether you shake? Do you notice whether you've been having tremors? No, not at all. OK Do you notice whether you feel erm… any history of erm… heat or told cold intolerance?

So any previous histories of termination of pregnancy, whether voluntary, or any miscarriages in the past? No, that's all. OK, so do you have any medical conditions yourself say hypertension, Diabetes. No, they've never told me I was diabetic. But I know one time when we went to do tests in my… the sugar, I cannot remember the value now but it was… they said it was on the borderline that I need to watch it. OK. So that that's suggesting that you’re pre diabetic Something like that, they said I should watch it and my sugar was on the high side that day. OK, how about your how about your family members do you know anybody who is diabetic? Yes, my mom is diabetic Your mom is diabetic. OK, All right. So how long have you been married with your husband? erm...We married for about two years now, about two years but we've been trying to have children for… ‘cause we got married maybe 2022. Yes.

You and your husband, Both of you. Do you… Do you both drink? Yeah. When we go out once in a while you know, for partying and all of that, we used to drink. All right. So, I'll still ask you some series of other questions just to make sure we did not miss out any other important details. OK, Sir. All right. So, any cough? No. Chest pain or Breathlessness? No. No, All right. Any headaches? Any blurring of vision? No, Not at all. No visual disturbances? No. OK. So, also very important, do you lactate? Have you been having any Milky discharge? From my breast? From your breast Yes. No. No. OK. Any abdominal pain? No. Any… Any Constipation? No. Any leg swelling? Not at all. Palpitations. Palpitations, No. All right. All right. OK. So uhm, basically uhm from your history, I… the history you're giving me is highly suggestive that you have a medical condition uhm… called PCOS and that's short for polycystic ovarian syndrome. Uhm… And that's because of the… that's because of your inability to conceive and the irregular menstruation coupled with the fact that you have uhm an unusual hair distribution pattern and then your… you uhm, your fasting blood sugar like you said is uhm… suggestive that you're pre diabetic and that's associated with the condition. So we are going to uhm… send you to the lab to do some couple of tests and basically just to confirm what I'm thinking about uhm… and then to rule out other causes, other possible causes of infertility uhm.., usually another close 'cause that I think you might have would be primary ovarian failure, right? Uhm  So basically we would send you for the test just to make sure that uhm… we rule out this other condition. So the test that you'll be doing would involve a repeat of your fasting blood sugar, right. OK And possibly a 2 hours, 2 hour post pandial, So meaning that you'll take your blood sample before you eat and then two hours after you eat and then compare, right. Then we'd also want to do a hormonal profile, right? So, take your blood sample to check for some hormones that we think are in control of your ovulation. So, we'll be checking for your follicle… FSH, LH, you don't really need to worry about these terms, but basically just for you to have an idea of what we are talking about. So, we check for the hormones that control your ovulation, right? And then we'd also send you for an ultrasound scan to check your ovaries basically, which is usually the most confirmatory test that is available to us to diagnose whether or not you actually have polycystic ovarian syndrome, right. OK, Sir. Basically that would be it for the investigations and then for the treatment once the results come out and we confirm that this is the condition you have, would want to most likely place you on an oral hypoglycemic agent, Metformin, you might be familiar with that, most diabetic patients use that, so that would help in controlling the weight gain and your sensitivity to insulin, right. And then for your acne, we'd want to put you on some uhm… topical medications, mostly creams that you can apply that would uhm… reduce or curb the the the acne. So basically, Isotretinoin cream and benzoyl peroxide. So, what you do is to apply the benzoyl peroxide face wash in the morning and then uhm… use a face wash afterwards and then while use a face wash afterwards and then at night… At night… you then you go about your day as usual or you have to wear a sunscreen, that's very important. And then at night, you can use the tretinoin cream after using your face wash before you go to sleep, right. So that takes care of the acne. Do you have any other problems in particular that you might want us to talk about? Not at all, Sir. But if we do all these things, so I'll be able to get pregnant. Yes, yes. Uhm… Well, also I uhm mentioned earlier that it involves an ovulation problem. So basically, it will be advisable for us to put you on a drug, clomifene citrates. That drug would help with uhm…  ovulation because basically one of the problems you're having is that you're not sending enough eggs for fertilization. So placing you on that drug would help you with ovulation to make sure that you have enough eggs for sperm to fertilize after sexual intercourse. So we place you on that drug, and then hopefully, you should be able to get pregnant. Thank you, Sir. All right, So, do you have any questions for me or do you have any Gray areas that you might want me to clarify? Not at all, Sir All right, So I think that would be the end of the consultation for today. If you have any concerns, you can please let us know. No problem, Sir.
