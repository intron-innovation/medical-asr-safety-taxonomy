P: Hi, so I just came in today because I've been just been feeling um, like my head's just been hurting for the past three or four days and I also felt really cold throughout the day for the last few days as well, so, um, I did end up checking my temperature just yesterday afternoon and it was um, 38.7 degrees celsius.

D: Okay, um. Tell me about the headache, where exactly is it? 

P: Yeah so it's kind of just throughout like the front of my forehead and it kind of goes to the side into my temple. 

D: And what does it feel like?

P: It feels like a constant aching. I've had uh, migraines before, but they like, it's not like the pulsating sensation that I usually get with them.

D: I see. Uh, okay, and how severe is the pain, if you had to rate it from 1 to 10?

P: Um, more than like severe. It's definitely less severe than my migraines, but it, it's just constant. It's, it's just been there for the last four days and I would say probably a 6 out of 10.

D: Did you do anything for the pain? Did you take any medications? Anything that makes it better?

P: Yeah, I took a Tylenol, I took um, Advil. It helps for like a few hours and then it just comes back.

D: And anything that makes the pain worse?

P: Um, I definitely think just, if I rest, it's better if, but if I'm like, like I can't, I can't concentrate on work or like anything.

GAS0003,/home/kelechi/bio_ramp_asr/data/uk_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/GAS0003.mp3,"D: What brings you in here today? 

P: Yeah hi, I'm I I have a pain in my belly. It started a couple hours ago.

D: OK, and where exactly in your belly do you have this pain?

P: It's mostly up here on the right side.

D: The right side, OK and can you describe what kind of pain is it? Is it like a dull pain or sharp pain, an aching pain? 

P: Oh I guess it's a, it's an aching pain I'd say. It kind of just, um, it would initially just come and go, but now it's just it's staying. It's not going away.

D: OK, and so it's in the right area and does it travel anywhere elsewhere besides on from the right side?

P: No. 

D: OK. And on a scale of 1 to 10, one being the least amount of pain you felt in your life, and 10 being the worst, how much would you rate it right now?

P: It's about to a 10, an 8 maybe.

D: An 8, OK and so just to clarify, when did it start?

P: About 8 hours ago.

D: 8 hours ago, OK. And were you doing anything before? Like, did you have a meal or how were you sleeping before it woke you up, what was going on before you had the pain?

P: I was just about to go to sleep. I wasn't doing anything in particular at the time.

D: OK. And has it been getting worse since it first started?

P: Oh yeah, definitely it would come and go, but now for the past I'd say five to six hours, it's been constant, just there all the time. 

D: OK. And have you had any similar pain like this in the past?

P: Yeah, uh I I have the same pain that sort of comes and goes after I eat. Usually after I've had something like a something fatty, something from outdoors, maybe like a burger or fries or something. I initially thought it was indigestion, but I don't I don't know what's going on now.

D: OK, and does it, does anything make it better or worse or anything that you've tried?

P: Well, I guess eating sometimes makes it worse, um, but I don't I don't think there's anything that's making it better.

D: OK, have you tried any medications at all?

P: I tried Tylenol but that didn't do anything.

D: OK. And besides, uh, the pain that you're having, do you have any nausea and vomiting?

P: I am a little nauseous, but no, I didn't, haven't had I haven't vomited yet, no.

D: OK, and have you been having any fevers?

P: I don't think so. I haven't checked. I don't feel feverish.

D: Any sweats or like chills?

P: No,  I don't think so.

D: OK, any changes in your bowel movements like constipation, diarrhea?

P: No. 

D: OK. Have you traveled anywhere recently?

P: No, I haven't. 

D: Have you been feeling at all, very tired, not your usual self, fatigued?

P: Well the pain is making it difficult for me to do things, um, but I I guess I'm not, uh a little fatigued  maybe.

D: OK. Um, have you been having any changes in your urinary patterns? 

P: No.

D: No? Any changes in your skin and you rashes, any yellowing of your skin?

P: Nothing that I've noticed, no, I don't think so. 

D: OK. Any changes in your urine color?

P: No. 

D: OK, have you noticed blood in your stools at all?

P: I have not, no.

D: OK, and how about your appetite, has this changed at all?

P: Well, I guess because it's this thing happens usually happens after I eat, I think I've been eating less than usual, just because I don't, I don't want to, you know, I don't like the pain.

D: Any significant weight loss recently?

P: I don't think so.

D: OK, any recent infections recently at all?

P: No. 

D: Um, and otherwise are you, do you have any other medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure or anything else?

P: I do have diabetes but that's about it I think.

D: And you take anything for your diabetes?

P: I take metformin.

D: OK, um do you take any other medications at all? 

P: No, I don't, sorry, no. 

D: No worries. Do you have any allergies to any medications, any environmental allergies?

P: No no, no, I don't. 

D: OK. And have you been hospitalized in the past?

P: No, no I haven't ever. I've been very uh healthy. No hospitalizations. 

D: Any past surgeries?

P: I got my wisdom teeth removed when I was a teenager. 

D: OK. Have you been in contact with anyone who has been ill recently?

P: No, I don't think so. 

D: OK. Hmm, and in terms of your family history, has anyone had any cancers or um any err um IBD like Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis?

P: No, not that I know of. 

D: OK. And anything that runs in the family at all?

P: My dad had a heart attack when he was in his 60s. But that's it. 

D: OK. And um, currently right now do you work?

P: Oh no, I'm I'm laid off because of COVID.

D: OK. And currently, what is your home situation like?

P: What do you mean?

D: So do you live in an apartment, house and do you live with anyone?

P: I I I live in an apartment, I live alone.

D: Um, and in terms of your daily routine, do you feel that you get enough exercise? Do you go outside for walks or runs or anything like that?

P: I usually go out for a run, especially when it's a little bit warmer, which it now is. 

D: And do you do you drink alcohol? 

P: Uh, sometimes.

D: How much would you say you drink in an average week?

P: One to two drinks a day.

D: OK, and what do you usually drink?

P: I'll just drink a glass of wine at night, just helps me relax. 

D: OK. And do you smoke cigarettes?

P: I don't, no. 

D: OK. And do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana?

P: No, I don't. 

D: OK. Alright, so um, that's all the questions I have and just to clarify, does your pain come and go, or is it constant?

P: Yes, so initially it would come and go, but now, so for the first 2 hours it would come and go. And when I would have this pain when I was eating, it would come and go. But over the past six hours it's just been constant. 

D: OK. Alright.",522.019375,us_medical,"What brings you in today? Hi, I'm uh, um, I'm just so I, I'm here because I have this cough that I've had for the past um, week and a half.

Any changes in your sleep or appetite? No. Okay. Any loss of sense of taste or smell at all? Um, initially, I guess I got a cough for a few days. My nose was a little stuffy so yeah, I couldn't smell very well. But since then it's been fine. Okay. No loss of taste, no. Okay. Any recent significant changes to your weight at all over the last few months? No. Okay. Any exposure in your home environment to dust, fumes, any animals in the household? No. Okay. Any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past? No, I'm pretty healthy. Okay. Any allergies, either to medications or environmental? Um, I'm allergic to penicillin. Okay. What kind of reaction do you get to penicillin? Um, I was told that I got a rash when I was a child. I don't really remember. Okay. And do you take any medications on a regular basis? No. No? Okay. Have you been hospitalized in the past or had any surgeries? Um, I had my appendix removed about five years ago. Five years ago? Okay. Any complications at all after that? No. Okay. Any family history of any lung conditions, heart conditions, any cancers at all? Colon cancer? Yeah, my dad and my grandfather had it. Okay. And have you had any scopes done recently at all? Oh yeah, I had mine done seven years ago. Seven years ago? Okay. And were there any findings at all? No. Okay. Currently, so you work from home, so what's your home and living situation? Who do you live with? And where do you live in a house, apartment? I live in an apartment with my wife and my daughter. Okay. And do they have any symptoms at all or are they fine? Well, my daughter doesn't have any symptoms anymore. She had some flu-like symptoms two weeks ago. My wife's been healthy. Okay. And does your daughter go to school right now or is she doing school from home? At home. Okay. And do you at all smoke? So you mentioned your symptoms get worse with smoking. How much would you say you smoke on an average day? I don't, I've been trying to cut down so I just drank on the weekend, maybe a glass or two of wine. Okay. And yeah, so those were kind of all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions you can share? No. No. I guess I was just worried about the cough. It's just, I was worried that it could be COVID. Yeah, so definitely right now, any of these symptoms like COVID can have a lot of different symptoms, so we should definitely make sure that to check if you have COVID or not and we'll get a COVID cough test done for you today. And the results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. And in that time, you will need to isolate even in your own home, try to wear a mask around your family members, try to eat separately and use all those methods. And then after the test comes back, you may, you'll be contacted by public health if it's positive and kind of given more instruction on what to do. And it doesn't necessarily have to be COVID either. It can be just another virus, like it can be just a common cold that's been going on. So it does seem that your symptoms have gone better. Oftentimes a cough can be the last thing to go. It can take up to two weeks or more for the cough to get relieved, but it seems that you're not having any systemic symptoms like no fevers or anything else right now, so it's, it's, that's pretty good. Great, I'm glad. Alright, yeah. Thank you. You're welcome.

D: OK. And have you had any similar pain like this in the past?

P: Yeah, uh I I have the same pain that sort of comes and goes after I eat. Usually after I've had something like a something fatty, something from outdoors, maybe like a burger or fries or something. I initially thought it was indigestion, but I don't I don't know what's going on now.

D: OK, and does it, does anything make it better or worse or anything that you've tried?

P: Well, I guess eating sometimes makes it worse, um, but I don't I don't think there's anything that's making it better.

RES0171,/home/kelechi/bio_ramp_asr/data/uk_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/RES0171.mp3,"D: What brings you in today?

P: Yeah, I've had a shortness of breath, and even at at rest. Really, feeling like it's difficult to breathe, and when I take a deep breath I get a chest pain.

D: When did this start?

P: This started yesterday.

D: How bad is your shortness of breath?

P: Like, I don't know. I feel like I'm OK, like n terms of being able to breathe, but I mean if I exert myself at all, there's no way I would be able to. It's, I just feel like even at rest it's hard to breathe.

D: OK, has it gotten worse since yesterday or better, or kind of been the same?

P: It's mostly been that been the same or actually sorry it's got, got a little bit worse at first. It was more more with exertion, and now it's, at rest as well. So yeah, it's got worse. 

D: I see, OK. Are you able to talk in full sentences or do you need to take a deep like stop to take a breath?

P: I could talk in full sentences. 

D: And the chest pain, does it only occur when you take a deep breath, or are there other times as well?

P: I pretty much yeah only when I'm taking a deep breath and say, I mean, maybe that's why part of the I can't take a deep breath so it's making me feel it's making the breathing more difficult making me feel more short of breath. 

D: OK. Any other symptoms that you've had? A fever or headache?

P: No, nothing like that. 

D: Any cough? 

P: Yeah, I, I've had a cough as well over that the same same time period.

D: OK any other flu like symptoms, runny nose, stuffy nose, sore throat? Anything like that?

P: No, I just had um, yeah, the shortness of breath and chest pain.

D: OK, uhm. And have you, I guess I just invited more general questions about others potential symptoms. Do you feel like your heart is racing or do you feel like you have, uhm, do you have any belly pain or any changes in your bowel movements?

P: No belly pain or changes to bowel movements, but I do feel like my heart is beating really fast really fast though.

D: Yeah, OK. Uhm, you said this started yesterday. Were you like completely fine the day before?

P: Uh I was yeah. 

D: Anything that's happened recently that's different or new?

P: I'm well it like uh, about two weeks ago I had a hysterectomy 'cause I, for abnormal bleeding. Yeah I had surgery 2 weeks ago.

D: What have you been doing these past two weeks in terms of sort of physical activity? Have you been moving around or no?

P: It's it's certainly been less I I've been moving a little bit, but I've had a lot of pain so I just haven't been doing as much activity, that's for sure.

D: I I see and have you had any, I guess any pain in your legs. Or swelling in your leg? One or the other?

P: Yeah, I have had actually, yeah my right my right calf is pretty sore. 

D: Definitely have a look at that. Have you noticed that it's been bigger or more red or warm? 

P: Um, no, I don't notice anything like that, just I, just really hurts. 

D: Uh, OK. Any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?

P: Um, yeah, yeah and I have a high BMI. Type 2 diabetes and anxiety.

D: Do you have any bleeding disorders?


P: Um other yeah, no. I think you're right. It said fibroids.

D: OK, OK. And do you take any medication?

P: Yeah, so uh insulin, well metformin. And then that's it. 

D: OK.

P: I'm sorry and then an SSRI. Like I said, low pram for anxiety. 

D: Alright. And do you have any allergies?

P: No, I don't.

D: And, who do you.. do you currently live alone?

P: Uh no, I live with my husband and and our two sons. 

D: OK and, do you, have anyone sort of come in to help you out over these past two weeks? Are you getting any outside help from nurses etc. Or are your are your family members being supportive and helpful? 

P: Yeah, it's been mostly the the family members. My husband's been working from home and the kids have been helpful as well. They are 10 and 12 so they are able to do some things on their own so yeah they've been supportive.

D: That's great. That's great. OK, and you smoke at all?

P: I do yes I I smoke about a half a pack per day. 

D: For how long?

P: Um, yeah, but I I started in my, yeah, after the kids were born actually, uh so like 10 years ago.

D: OK, have you tried cutting it down at all? 

P: Yeah, I have. I've kind of gone through spurts of quitting and restarting, quitting and restarting. So yeah, I've tried before.

D: OK, and what about marijuana or recreational drugs?

P: No, don't use anything like that.

D: And alcohol? 

P: Yeah I'll have some wine on the on the weekends, but maybe that's like a glass or two.

D: OK, OK uhm, and do you have any medical conditions that long run in the family?

P: Just, uh, yeah, my father actually had a stroke when he was 68, and that's it.

D: OK OK uhm. You haven't ever had one, have you?

P: No, I I haven't had anything like that. 

D: OK, alright. So. I guess come to in terms of smoking, you said that you've tried to quit a couple of times in the past. Do you intend on trying again? I know it can be very hard to, to quit smoking.

P: Yeah, it's only something that is always kind of in the back of my mind.

D: OK, if there's I'm happy to assist you and share resources and problems like medications and things like that that could help you if you're interested so we can talk more about that. talking about your I guess you mentioned that your weight is a little higher than or, its outside the normal range, is that something that you would like to cut down?

P: Yeah, I really try to eat more vegetables and have been trying to do that sort of thing. I've lost a few pounds, but not enough, definitely want to keep going.

D: OK, good good, as long as you feel that you what you're currently doing is helping you and is helping you reduce weight. That's great. But also I'm here for you if you need more education or guidance on that. So, given what you've told me so far, it sounds like you might have developed a clot in your leg somewhere, simply because you had a surgery and you were not moving around very much. Sometimes that causes the blood to kind of, not move around your body is as as much as it usually does, and kind of stays in one place and get turned into a clot and that clot can sometimes get dislodged and settle into your lungs, and that can make it difficult for you to breathe. So, we'll do some tests that that's what my understanding is. Given what you've told me so far, but we do have to confirm it using a test. Also, the fact that you smoke and your weight, and your BMI is high, increases your risk of developing a clot, so I would definitely strongly recommend that you continue to try to reduce both and try to quit smoking. And so we'll do an ultrasound of your leg and we'll do a scan of your chest and see what's going on and then decide if we need to give you any medications, like any blood thinning medications.

P: OK, yeah, that sounds really good. Thank you.

P: Like, I don't know. I feel like I'm OK, like n terms of being able to breathe, but I mean if I exert myself at all, there's no way I would be able to. It's, I just feel like even at rest it's hard to breathe.

D: OK, has it gotten worse since yesterday or better, or kind of been the same?

P: It's mostly been that been the same or actually sorry it's got, got a little bit worse at first. It was more more with exertion, and now it's, at rest as well. So yeah, it's got worse. 

D: I see, OK. Are you able to talk in full sentences or do you need to take a deep like stop to take a breath?

P: I could talk in full sentences. 

D: And the chest pain, does it only occur when you take a deep breath, or are there other times as well?

P: I pretty much yeah only when I'm taking a deep breath and say, I mean, maybe that's why part of the I can't take a deep breath so it's making me feel it's making the breathing more difficult making me feel more short of breath. 

D: OK. Any other symptoms that you've had? A fever or headache?

P: No, nothing like that. 

D: Any cough? 

P: Yeah, I, I've had a cough as well over that the same same time period.

D: Is it a dry cough? Are you bringing something up?

P: It's dry, yeah, I haven't brought up any sputum or any any any blood.

D: OK any other flu like symptoms, runny nose, stuffy nose, sore throat? Anything like that?

P: No, I just had um, yeah, the shortness of breath and chest pain.

D: OK, uhm. And have you, I guess I just invited more general questions about others potential symptoms. Do you feel like your heart is racing or do you feel like you have, uhm, do you have any belly pain or any changes in your bowel movements?

P: No belly pain or changes to bowel movements, but I do feel like my heart is beating really fast really fast though.

D: Yeah, OK. Uhm, you said this started yesterday. Were you like completely fine the day before?

P: Uh I was yeah. 

D: Anything that's happened recently that's different or new?

P: I'm well it like uh, about two weeks ago I had a hysterectomy 'cause I, for abnormal bleeding. Yeah I had surgery 2 weeks ago.

D: What have you been doing these past two weeks in terms of sort of physical activity? Have you been moving around or no?

P: It's it's certainly been less I I've been moving a little bit, but I've had a lot of pain so I just haven't been doing as much activity, that's for sure.

D: I I see and have you had any, I guess any pain in your legs. Or swelling in your leg? One or the other?

P: Yeah, I have had actually, yeah my right my right calf is pretty sore. 

D: Definitely have a look at that. Have you noticed that it's been bigger or more red or warm? 

P: Um, no, I don't notice anything like that, just I, just really hurts. 

D: Uh, OK. Any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?

P: Um, yeah, yeah and I have a high BMI. Type 2 diabetes and anxiety.

D: Do you have any bleeding disorders?


P: Um other yeah, no. I think you're right. It said fibroids.

D: OK, OK. And do you take any medication?

P: Yeah, so uh insulin, well metformin. And then that's it. 

D: OK.

P: I'm sorry and then an SSRI. Like I said, low pram for anxiety. 

D: Alright. And do you have any allergies?

P: No, I don't.

D: And, who do you.. do you currently live alone?

P: Uh no, I live with my husband and and our two sons. 

D: OK and, do you, have anyone sort of come in to help you out over these past two weeks? Are you getting any outside help from nurses etc. Or are your are your family members being supportive and helpful? 

P: Yeah, it's been mostly the the family members. My husband's been working from home and the kids have been helpful as well. They are 10 and 12 so they are able to do some things on their own so yeah they've been supportive.

D: That's great. That's great. OK, and you smoke at all?

P: I do yes I I smoke about a half a pack per day. 

D: For how long?

P: Um, yeah, but I I started in my, yeah, after the kids were born actually, uh so like 10 years ago.

D: OK, have you tried cutting it down at all? 

P: Yeah, I have. I've kind of gone through spurts of quitting and restarting, quitting and restarting. So yeah, I've tried before.

D: OK, and what about marijuana or recreational drugs?

P: No, don't use anything like that.

D: And alcohol? 

P: Yeah I'll have some wine on the on the weekends, but maybe that's like a glass or two.

D: OK, OK uhm, and do you have any medical conditions that long run in the family?

P: Just, uh, yeah, my father actually had a stroke when he was 68, and that's it.

D: OK OK uhm. You haven't ever had one, have you?

P: No, I I haven't had anything like that. 

D: OK, alright. So. I guess come to in terms of smoking, you said that you've tried to quit a couple of times in the past. Do you intend on trying again? I know it can be very hard to, to quit smoking.

P: Yeah, it's only something that is always kind of in the back of my mind.

D: OK, if there's I'm happy to assist you and share resources and problems like medications and things like that that could help you if you're interested so we can talk more about that. talking about your I guess you mentioned that your weight is a little higher than or, its outside the normal range, is that something that you would like to cut down?

P: Yeah, I really try to eat more vegetables and have been trying to do that sort of thing. I've lost a few pounds, but not enough, definitely want to keep going.

D: OK, good good, as long as you feel that you what you're currently doing is helping you and is helping you reduce weight. That's great. But also I'm here for you if you need more education or guidance on that. So, given what you've told me so far, it sounds like you might have developed a clot in your leg somewhere, simply because you had a surgery and you were not moving around very much. Sometimes that causes the blood to kind of, not move around your body is as as much as it usually does, and kind of stays in one place and get turned into a clot and that clot can sometimes get dislodged and settle into your lungs, and that can make it difficult for you to breathe. So, we'll do some tests that that's what my understanding is. Given what you've told me so far, but we do have to confirm it using a test. Also, the fact that you smoke and your weight, and your BMI is high, increases your risk of developing a clot, so I would definitely strongly recommend that you continue to try to reduce both and try to quit smoking. And so we'll do an ultrasound of your leg and we'll do a scan of your chest and see what's going on and then decide if we need to give you any medications, like any blood thinning medications.

P: OK, yeah, that sounds really good. Thank you.

D: Welcome.","D: What brings you in today?

P: Yeah, I've had a shortness of breath, and even at at rest. Really, feeling like it's difficult to breathe, and when I take a deep breath I get a chest pain.

RES0125,/home/kelechi/bio_ramp_asr/data/uk_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/RES0125.mp3,"D: What brings you in here today?

P: Hi, I'm um, I'm just, so I am here because I have this cough that I've had for the past um, week and a half, and I'm just uh, I usually don't come in with symptoms this minor, but because it's, because we're in the middle of a pandemic, I thought I should come in and get checked out.

D: Okay, yeah, so it's been going on for like more than a week. Um, can you describe to me what kind of cough you're having? Is it like a wet cough or a dry cough?

P: It's a dry cough.

D: Okay, and has it been getting worse over the, over the time period you described?

P: Um, it's kind of the same.

D: It's the same. Um, have you noticed, although it's like dry, have you brought up any kind of sputum or phlegm at all?

P: Um no, not, not, not recently. But yeah, in the first couple of days, the first two, three days.

D: Okay, and is there any anything that makes it better or worse?

P: Um, I um, I take this cough syrup, over the counter syrup, that helps.

D: School from home, okay. Um, and do you at all smoke? So you mentioned your symptoms get worse with smoking.

P: Yeah. 

D: Um, how much would you say you smoke on an average day?

P: Um, I don't, I try, I've been trying to cut down, so I, I smoke about 3 or 4 cigarettes a week. I used to smoke a lot more before.

D: Wow, yeah, that's really good! That's really great progress, um, it's really difficult to quit, but it's great to see that you're trying to quit. Um, so how much would you say you used to smoke?

P: Well, half a pack. Um, half a pack a day, but then over the past three years I've been trying to cut it down. I started smoking when I was 20, so it's been um, 30 years now.

D: No, okay. Um, currently so you work from home, so what's your home and living situation like? Who do you live with, and where, do you live in like a house, appartment?

P: Uh, I live in an apartment with my wife and my daughter.

D: Okay uh, and uh, do they have any symptoms at all? Or are they, are they fine?

P: Well, my daughter doesn't have any symptoms anymore. She did as I mentioned, have some flu like symptoms 2 weeks ago. My wife's been healthy.

D: Okay, and uh, does your daughter go to school right now or is she doing school from home?

P: Uh, school from home.

D: School from home, okay. Um, and do you at all smoke? So you mentioned your symptoms get worse with smoking.

P: Yeah. 

D: Um, how much would you say you smoke on an average day?

P: Um, I don't, I try, I've been trying to cut down, so I, I smoke about 3 or 4 cigarettes a week. I used to smoke a lot more before.

D: Wow, yeah, that's really good! That's really great progress, um, it's really difficult to quit, but it's great to see that you're trying to quit. Um, so how much would you say you used to smoke?

P: Well, half a pack. Um, half a pack a day, but then over the past three years I've been trying to cut it down. I started smoking when I was 20, so it's been um, 30 years now.

D: Okay, so 30 years, okay. And um, are you just, are you using anything to help you quit smoking or are you doing it without any medications, or um, like, have you used anything in the past that has worked for you?

P: Um, no I, I went to my doc and he said to try on my own first and if I'm struggling with it to come back, but I've been doing it very gradually so it's, it's going well.

D: Okay, and that's really good. And yeah, if you, at all, need any resources to help you quit smoking, it's great that you're doing really well, but if you need to talk more about it or need any more resources we can provide that for you. Um, other than uh, smoking cigarettes, do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana at all?

P: No.

D: No. How about alcohol?

P: Uh, I just drink on the weekends. Maybe a glass or two of wine.

D: Okay, and uh yeah. So those were kind of all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions or concerns?

P: No.

D: No?

P: I was, I guess I was just worried about the cough um, it's just, I was worried that it could be COVID.

D: Yeah, so definitely right now, any of these symptoms, like COVID can have a lot of different symptoms um, so we should definitely make sure that we, to check if you have COVID or not and we'll get a COVID swab test done for you today, and the results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. Uh, and in that time, you will need to isolate even in your own home. Try to wear a mask around your family members, um, trying to eat separately and use all those methods, and, and then after the test comes back you may, you'll be contacted by public health if it's positive and kind of given more instruction on what to do. And it doesn't necessarily have to be COVID either, it can be just another virus uh, like it can be just your common cold that's been going on. So it does seem that your symptoms have gotten better. Oftentimes uh, a cough can be the last thing to go, it can take up to two weeks or more for the cough to get relieved, but it seems that you're not having any systemic symptoms like no fevers or anything else right now, so it's, it's uh, that's, that's pretty good.

P: Great, I'm glad. 

D: Alright, yeah.

RES0087,/home/kelechi/bio_ramp_asr/data/uk_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/RES0087.mp3,"D: What brings you in?

P: Yeah, I'm just coming in with my son, he's been having, he's been complaining of just, seems like pain in his right ear for the last I would say three to four days. And it seems like he's just more irritable, just not himself right now.

D: Yeah OK, so, how long did you say he's had this ear pain?

P: I would say four days now. 

D: Four days, OK. Have you noticed any hearing loss? 

P: Uh, no, he still responds when I call his name.

D: OK and, have you noticed any fluid coming out of his ears?

P: Uh, no, I don't think so.

D: Is it more like one side of his ears or is it both ears?

P: It's just his right ear.

D: Just his right ear, OK. And have you noticed that it's like, swollen, red or warm?

P: Uh, no, I don't see any swelling or redness at all.

D: OK, OK, good, and have you taken a look inside his ears?

P: Yeah, I tried to take a look with a flashlight. I couldn't really see too much.

D: OK, yeah, that's fair. And you mentioned he's had a runny nose too, When did that start?

P: Yeah, so that, kind of like last week he was recovering from, I think it was just a cold and he had a runny nose and just was a bit congested. But then over the last week it kind of just resolved. But then this week he started having just this ear pain.

D: OK. Any fevers? 

P: Uh, no, not that I, I haven't measured anything and he hasn't mentioned any, like he hasn't felt cold or anything like that.

D: OK, any weight loss over the past month or so?

P: No.

D: No, any change in his hair or nails, like rashes or, sorry, or skin?

P: Yeah, no, I haven't seen any changes in the skin.

D: OK, any changes in his vision or smell or taste?

P: No.

D: No, OK. His runny nose, what color is it?

P: It was mainly, uh, it seemed to me like it was mainly clear when it was happening, like he wasn't bringing up any yellow or green material.

D: OK, good. Does he have a sore throat at all?

P: No, not that he's told me. He's still eating things and I don't think he's having any trouble with eating anything, so I don't think so.

D: OK, that's good. Has he had a cough?

P: Uhm, actually he did. He did start coughing like yesterday, but just a few times a day. I don't know if it's because of this or like, what else might be going on.

D: OK, and you said for the past few days, he's had the cough?

P: Yeah, I think just maybe started yesterday.

D: Started yesterday, OK. Is it a dry cough or is it, is he bringing up any phlegm?

P: No, it seems to be just dry. I think I just noticed it like three or four times during the day yesterday.

D: OK, so no blood that he's bringing up right?

P: No, no.

D: OK, and does he have any shortness of breath?

P: No, no.

D: No, OK, any wheezing?

P: No, no wheezing. 

D: No chest pain?

P: No.

D: OK, uhm, any nausea or vomiting?

P: No nausea or vomiting.

D: Any changes to his bowel movements?

P: No.

D: No, OK and, how about urine, is that normal?

P: Yeah, Uh, no changes at all.

D: Any headaches? 

P: Not that he's told me about.

D: OK, dizziness or fainting spells?

P: No.

D: Feeling like he's off balance or lost coordination?

P: No, I don't think so.

D: No, OK, no numbness, no tingling?

P: No.

D: Has he had any contacts with sick people recently?

P: Uhm, no, I don't think anyone's been sick around him.

D: OK and has he traveled to anywhere recently?

P: Uh, no, like, he's mainly just been inside his home. 

D: OK. has he ever had ear pain before?

P: He did have a similar pain, I think when he was like around three years old, but it happened with his left left ear, not the right one.

D: OK, was he prescribed any medications?

P: Uh yeah, he was given a, like a course of antibiotics at that time. I forgot what it was called, but I think at that time it was much worse, like he, I don't know if he was just younger and couldn't tolerate it but I think he also had a fever at that time.

D: OK, OK, and then any other ear infections outside of that one time.

P: No, I think that, only that one I can recall.

D: OK, alright, is he otherwise healthy?

P: Yeah, otherwise he's healthy. No, other conditions or anything like that.

D: No hospitalizations or surgeries? 

P: No.

D: And is he on any medications?

P: No medications. 

D: OK, is he up to date with all his immunizations?

P: Yeah, all his immunizations are good.

D: OK, any allergies?

P: Not that we know of so far.

D: And any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions.

P: No lung or heart conditions. Just, his father does have like celiac disease, so I don't know if that's related at all.

D: OK, how old was he when was diagnosed with celiac?

P: Fairly young I would say, in his 20s.

D: OK, OK, uhm, alright, we'll keep an eye on it in him, like if he has any changes in his bowel movements or if he's getting severe abdominal pain after eating certain foods with gluten you can get him checked up for that as well.

P: OK. 

D: Yeah and then, in terms of where he lives, does he live with you and your partner?

P: Yeah, so it's just, he's an only child, lives with me and my husband, and also we have like a pet dog.

D: OK, do you live in an apartment or in a house?

P: We live in a, it's like a condominium.

D: OK, OK, any old carpet, mold or asbestos in the building?

P: No, no, nothing like that. It's fairly well kept. 

D: OK, And is he other-wise like developmental-wise, he's OK? There's no past history of like developmental disorders, anything like that?

P: No, no issues from like when he was younger like no complaints at all. I Think he was doing the same as every other child.

D: OK, no complications during your pregnancy with him, no complications during the actual delivery and then when he was a newborn?

P: Uh no, no complications, it was just a vaginal birth at 39 weeks and we didn't need to stay in the hospital at all afterwards.

D: OK, good. So those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?

P: Yeah, I don't know if, uh, like last time we did get some antibiotics. I don't know if he needs them right now or what would you recommend?

D: Yeah, uhm so I'm gonna have to take a look into his ears first before I can come up with like a management plan for him. So once I do, if I see, uhm, if his tympanic membrane has been perforated or I see pus in there, we'll prescribe him like 10 days of antibiotics. We can give him either Amoxicillin, or if he has bad reactions to penicillins,  we can give him Cefuroxime and then if, uh, it doesn't seem to have any systemic symptoms, so if he has systemic symptoms like fever, which we'll check for today, and if he's like been really ill and he has like a middle ear effusion or bulging tympanic membrane, again we'll give him antibiotics for 10 days. But if his tympanic membrane is just bulging a little bit, or if he has some middle ear effusion but no systemic symptoms, like, no fevers, and he seems to be fine otherwise, we'll reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see if he's better and if he's not, again, will prescribe him antibiotics. How does that sound?

P: Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you.

D: OK yeah, no worries.",675.65225,us_medical,"What brings you in here today?

Has he ever had ear pain before uh he did have a similar um pain i think when he was like around three years old but it happened with his left left ear not the right one okay okay was he prescribed any medication uh yeah he he was given um uh like a course of antibiotics um at that time i forgot what it was called but i i think at that time it was much worse um like he i don't know if he was just younger and couldn tolerate it, but I think he also had a fever at that time. Okay. Okay. And, um, any other ear infections outside of that one time? Uh, no, I think that only, only that one I can recall. Okay. All right. Um, is he otherwise healthy? Yeah, otherwise he's healthy. No other conditions or anything like that. No hospitalizations or surgeries? No. Okay. And is he on any medications? No medications. Okay. Is he up to date with all his immunizations? Yeah, all his immunizations are good. Okay. Any allergies? Not that we know of so far. Okay. Any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions? no longer heart conditions um just uh there's his father does have like celiac disease i don't know if that's related at all okay how old was he when is diagnosed with celiac fairly young i would say in his 20s. Okay. Okay. All right. Well, keep an eye on it in him. Like if he has any changes in his bowel movements or if he's getting severe abdominal pain after eating certain foods with gluten, you can get him checked up for that as well. Okay. And then in terms of where he lives, does he live with you and your partner? Yeah, so it's just he's an only child a, he's an only child, um, lives with me and my husband and, uh, also, um, uh, we have, like, a pet dog. Okay. Do you live in an, in an apartment or in a house? Um, we live in, uh, it's like a, like a condominium. Oh, okay. Okay. Any old carpet, mold, or asbestos in the building? No, nothing like that. It's fairly well kept. Okay. Okay. And is he otherwise, like developmental-wise, he's okay? There's no past history of, like, developmental disorders, anything like that? No, he has no issues from, like, when he was younger, like, no complaints at all. I think he was doing the same as every other child. Okay, and no complications during your pregnancy with him, no complications during the actual delivery, and then when he was a newborn? No, no complications. It was just a vaginal birth at 39 weeks, and we didn't need to stay in the hospital at all afterwards okay good um so those are all the questions that I had for you today did you have any questions of your own uh yeah I don't know if um like last time we did get some antibiotics I don't know if he needs them right now or what would you recommend? Yeah. So I'm going to have to take a look into his ears first before I can come up with like a management plan for him. So once I do, if I see if his tympanic membrane has been perforated or I see pus in there, we'll prescribe him like 10 days of antibiotics. We can give him either, um, amoxicillin or if he has bad reactions to penicillins, we can give him, uh, cefuroxime. And then if, um, it doesn't seem to have any systemic symptoms so if he has systemic symptoms like fever which we'll check for today um and if he's like been really ill um and he has like a middle ear effusion or bulging tympanic membrane again we'll give him antibiotics for 10 days but if his tympanic membrane is just bulging a little bit or if he has some middle ear fusion but no systemic symptoms like um no fevers um and and he seems to be fine otherwise we'll reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see if he's better and if if he's not, again, we'll prescribe him antibiotics. How does that sound? Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you. Okay. Yeah, no worries.","D: What brings you in?

P: Yeah, I'm just coming in with my son, he's been having, he's been complaining of just, seems like pain in his right ear for the last I would say three to four days. And it seems like he's just more irritable, just not himself right now.

D: Yeah OK, so, how long did you say he's had this ear pain?

P: I would say four days now. 

D: Four days, OK. Have you noticed any hearing loss? 

P: Uh, no, he still responds when I call his name.

D: OK and, have you noticed any fluid coming out of his ears?

P: Uh, no, I don't think so.

D: Is it more like one side of his ears or is it both ears?

P: It's just his right ear.

D: Just his right ear, OK. And have you noticed that it's like, swollen, red or warm?

P: Uh, no, I don't see any swelling or redness at all.

D: OK, OK, good, and have you taken a look inside his ears?

P: Yeah, I tried to take a look with a flashlight. I couldn't really see too much.

D: OK, yeah, that's fair. And you mentioned he's had a runny nose too, When did that start?

P: Yeah, so that, kind of like last week he was recovering from, I think it was just a cold and he had a runny nose and just was a bit congested. But then over the last week it kind of just resolved. But then this week he started having just this ear pain.

D: OK. Any fevers? 

P: Uh, no, not that I, I haven't measured anything and he hasn't mentioned any, like he hasn't felt cold or anything like that.

D: OK, any weight loss over the past month or so?

P: No.

D: No, any change in his hair or nails, like rashes or, sorry, or skin?

P: Yeah, no, I haven't seen any changes in the skin.

D: OK, any changes in his vision or smell or taste?

P: No.

D: No, OK. His runny nose, what color is it?

P: It was mainly, uh, it seemed to me like it was mainly clear when it was happening, like he wasn't bringing up any yellow or green material.

D: OK, good. Does he have a sore throat at all?

P: No, not that he's told me. He's still eating things and I don't think he's having any trouble with eating anything, so I don't think so.

D: OK, that's good. Has he had a cough?

P: Uhm, actually he did. He did start coughing like yesterday, but just a few times a day. I don't know if it's because of this or like, what else might be going on.

D: OK, and you said for the past few days, he's had the cough?

P: Yeah, I think just maybe started yesterday.

D: Started yesterday, OK. Is it a dry cough or is it, is he bringing up any phlegm?

P: No, it seems to be just dry. I think I just noticed it like three or four times during the day yesterday.

D: OK, so no blood that he's bringing up right?

P: No, no.

D: OK, and does he have any shortness of breath?

P: No, no.

D: OK. has he ever had ear pain before?

P: He did have a similar pain, I think when he was like around three years old, but it happened with his left left ear, not the right one.

D: OK, was he prescribed any medications?

P: OK. 

D: Yeah and then, in terms of where he lives, does he live with you and your partner?

P: Yeah, so it's just, he's an only child, lives with me and my husband, and also we have like a pet dog.

D: OK, do you live in an apartment or in a house?

P: We live in a, it's like a condominium.

D: OK, OK, any old carpet, mold or asbestos in the building?

P: No, no, nothing like that. It's fairly well kept. 

D: OK, And is he other-wise like developmental-wise, he's OK? There's no past history of like developmental disorders, anything like that?

P: No, no issues from like when he was younger like no complaints at all. I Think he was doing the same as every other child.

D: OK, no complications during your pregnancy with him, no complications during the actual delivery and then when he was a newborn?

P: Uh no, no complications, it was just a vaginal birth at 39 weeks and we didn't need to stay in the hospital at all afterwards.

D: OK, good. So those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?

RES0217,/home/kelechi/bio_ramp_asr/data/uk_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/RES0217.mp3,"D: So I understand you removed insects from your leg earlier today?

P: Yes I did, it was uh it was behind my left uh knee kind of in like the joint behind where it bends. Um it was stuck pretty good, it's still kind of red and tender there. I noticed it because the back of my knee was starting to just feel a bit sore, um not the joint itself, but just kind of the skin, the whole area back there. Um and I found this tick, I brought I brought it in with me if you wanted to have a look at it, um it's in like this little plastic container, uh and I don't really know when I got it. I was hiking on Friday um and then Saturday I was out in my garden, I hope they're not around my house, I hope that it was from hiking um and not gardening, but uh I did spend a lot of time outside on Saturday as well.

D: OK, so sounds like it's been a little bit of time since you were last outdoors to when you first noticed it?

P: Yeah.

D: OK, so when you picked it off the tick, obviously you have it for me, is it quite swollen or engorged?

P: It's not too bad, um I I have actually had a tick in the past and this is a long time ago and um maybe like 10 years and I actually had that kind of target rash thing that they talk about. And, uh at that time I remember I had to take antibiotics for a bit. Um this um didn't look like that, it was more, it was just kind of sore in one spot, I don't think it um it was as bad as that time and the tick that time, sorry I've kind of gotten off track, that time it was quite swollen, this one was maybe a little bit, but not as much.

D: OK, so just in terms of the tick's size, it doesn't look like it's been feeding for too long, so when ticks uh are feeding they tend to engorge, they tend to swell up, so this looks more like a tiny little bug or does it kind of look like a little grape, almost like it's been swollen up with blood?

P: No, this one, this one's pretty small.

D: This one's pretty small, OK. And I should mention that, well obviously you've had a tick bite in the past, the big concern for us is a disease called Lyme disease, which is spread by bacteria, but in fact only one type of tick predominantly is a transmission transmitory agent for it. It's called a deer tick, and its coloration, it's got a little bit of a brown butt and there's some black legs. Does it look like that at all?

P: I don't think so, uhm, I uh I was looking at the pictures online, I think it looks like the other kind of tick, um but I heard that, yeah, but I heard that lately now they've been considering all ticks in this area as possibly carriers of Lyme um because I think it's kind of become more more of a problem sm so that was making me a bit nervous.

D: OK, absolutely, what we can do is we can send this tick off to the lab and they'll be able to identify the species for it, but for tick bites in general, one of the key considerations is for how long it's been on your body for. So unfortunately, if you're out on Friday and Saturday, that'd mean that this tick has been on you for longer than at least 72 hours. So I think one way or another, we're likely going to have to put you on antibiotics just as kind of a prophylactic at the very least, just want to make sure that um you're not at risk of developing Lyme disease. I'm sure you've heard from the news that Lyme disease can present in a variety of ways, but it's a disease that we try our best to avoid. And just in terms of your symptoms, so you say you've had a bite in the past and you you've got that rash before, that kind of bullseye rash, do you have that rash now?

P: No, I don't uh as far as I know, I mean, you can have a look too. It's behind my knee, so it's not the easiest place to see, but it's uh it looks a little red, it's like tender where the tick was, but I don't see that like larger circle rash.

D: OK, that's reassuring. Now any, it'd be pretty unlikely for you to have other symptoms, but just in case, do you have any other joint pain? 

P: No.

D: Have you been feeling ill or have been feverish in the last little while?

P: No, no, I've been fine.

D: OK, and you removed that twit tick once you found it, you presented to me, have you checked your body for any other possible bites?

P: Oh yeah, I looked around and I looked at my husband too 'cause we we were just a little bit, you know, gave us a little bit of a scare, but no, there's been nothing else.

D: That's good. And did you bring a pet with you at all when you were hiking and gardening?

P: Uh no, I didn't, no.

D: OK, good. Any other family members you think might have been exposed?

P: Uh no it was just uh me and my husband.

D: OK, and what geographic area were you in um when you were hiking?

P: We were uh in Strathroy along the creek.

D: OK. I can do, if I remember there's a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario and we can see exactly how that lines up to see if we should be a little bit concerned or not. Looks like Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point, so I think that we will be moving forward with antibiotics, but of course we'll be talking to the physician who'll be having a look at you as well. So it sounds like you haven't been having too much symptoms aside from you've noticed this tick, the skin around it is fairly sore and you've had this in the past, but you were treated with antibiotics in the past and since then you haven't had too many health problems after that?

P: No, no. I've been pretty healthy.

D: OK, and just about your health right now, is there anything that you see the family physician or doctor for in general and regarding your health?

P: Uh just for my cholesterol.

D: OK, are you taking and medications for that?

P: Uh Yeah, I take a uh statin, can't remember which one. 

D: OK, got it. And do you have any allergies?

P: Uh no.

D: So no drug allergies?

P: No.

D: OK, now we've already talked about other exposures, so it doesn't sound like anyone else in your family or any pets are around, so it's unlikely that you have ticks coming in and you said you might have gotten this from gardening, but um you're hoping that your area doesn't have ticks. Maybe just take a look, ticks like to live in long grass, kind of on the intersection between woods and fields to see if there's any hovering around that kind of make a waving motion with their legs and they're sometimes easy to spot, you might wanna get some insecticide out there. But it sounds like this is fairly recent, unfortunately just for the length of time this tick might be on you for, it's probably safer than not to start you on some medications, but I'm going to go talk to the doctor after we do a quick physical exam, and we might also send the tick off to a local laboratory so they can identify the species for it definitively, as well as might just send some blood work just to see if there's any titres or any serology that would make us a little bit more concerned for Lyme disease. But aside from that you've been feeling well otherwise?

P: Yeah, totally fine. It was just a little tender there and that's the only reason I looked.

D: OK. So no headaches?

P: No.

D: Nothing like that?

P: Nothing like that. 

D: OK, excellent, alright. I'm fairly happy with what we talked about today. Do you have any questions for me Jean? 

P: No, this is pretty well what I expected today, so thanks for helping me out.

D: No problem. OK, I'll go talk to the doctor, we'll come back and talk to you, OK? 

P: Great, thanks.

D: Thanks Jean.",513.843125,us_medical,"How may I help you? I just came in because I've been having this just just yesterday. It started this sudden just pain over the front of my kind of like a shoulder and also elbow. And it was right after I was just doing some um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh No. How about any sensory changes like changes to vision or hearing? No. Any changes to your sense of smell or sense of taste? No. Have you had a runny nose or sore throat? No. Okay. Have you had a cough? No. Any shortness of breath? No. Okay. Any wheezing? No. Have you had any chest pain or feeling like your heart's racing? No. Any lightheadedness or dizziness? No. Okay. Any abdominal pain or nausea or vomiting? No. Any changes to your bowel movements like diarrhea or constipation or even blood in the stool? No. Any urination problems like pain or frequency? No. Any changes to your skin like rashes or changes to your nails or hair? No. Any neurological symptoms like numbness or tingling? No. Any muscle weakness? Just in that area, I can't really like, I can't really flex and really move my upper arm and elbow. No. Any pains in any other joints? No. Have you had any confusion or memory loss? No. And in the past, have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions? No, I've been pretty healthy. I think I do have prediabetes, but I'm not on any medication. Okay. And have you had any issues with your shoulder before like a subacromial impingement syndrome or a rotator cuff or problems in the past? A few years ago, I did have some pain with like, they told me not to do like overhead work, like just things that require like with physio I need to do some strengthening as well. It was it wasn't the same shoulder. Okay. And do you take any medications regularly? No. Okay. And do you have any allergies? No. Have you had any hospitalizations or prior surgeries? I had my tonsils removed when I was probably like 10 or something, but that's about it. Okay. And for the shoulder in the past, did you have any imaging done like an ultrasound or MRI maybe to look at the structures? No, it was just kind of went away. I just did some physio. They didn't really do any imaging. I see. Okay. And can you tell me a little about your living situation right now, who you're living with and where? Yes, I'm living with my wife and a daughter. And I'm living just in a condominium in the city. Okay. And are you working right now? Yeah, Are you an active person, like bodybuilding and that sort of thing regularly? Um, I just actually probably started this past year. I used to, I used to work out a lot in university and in my early 30s, but then I stopped and this year I've kind of gone back into it. Okay, well, it's good that you're staying active. And how about smoking cigarettes? No, I probably tried a couple times in high school and university, but just never my thing. Okay, and how about cannabis, like smoking marijuana or using any of those types of products? No, I try to stay away from any drugs. Okay, including recreational drugs. Yeah. Okay. And are there any musculoskeletal or neurological problems that run in the family? No, I don't think so. Okay. Now, how about any autoimmune diseases? No, I don't think so. Okay. So next I just wanted to ask you to have a look at the arm. And compared to the other side, are you noticing any swelling, redness, or, yeah, any swelling or redness? I do see some just like kind of like in the middle-ish area, some redness, kind of looks like some bruising in that in that region. And I also feel like when I like try to flex, my biceps kind of have moved upwards. Okay, is this the mass or lump that you were mentioning earlier that you kind of can notice in your right arm? Yeah, yeah. Okay, is that the mass or lump that you were mentioning earlier that you kind of can notice in your right arm? Okay, so you mentioned are you able to bend your elbow all the way up to flex it all the way up, or is the range of motion limited? It's pretty limited. It's pretty tough to flex. It's really painful. And then I also can't like, I can't turn my arm. I can't supinate. Okay. So you have reduced supination as well. And how are your shoulder movement? Are you able to lift your arms straight out in front of you? Are you able to lift them all the way up above your head? Like at the sides or in front of me? Yeah, the shoulder seems to be okay. I am able to lift up, but it's just if I try to move my upper arms at all, it hurts a lot. Okay. All right. So you'll get some pain at the shoulder with the movement. There is discomfort in It all suggests that there is a biceps tendon tear or injury there. And so we'll want to get an ultrasound or MRI to look at. We'll start with the ultrasound, but then possibly get an MRI as well to look at the extent of the tissue damage. But if there is just a long head of biceps tear, it will usually be treated conservatively. And so we'll just need to look to see what the extent of the injury is. Okay."," So, I understand you removed an insect from your leg earlier today? Yes, I did. It was behind my left knee, kind of in, like, the joint behind where it bends. It was stuck pretty good. It's still kind of red and tender there. I noticed it because the back of my knee was starting to just feel a bit sore. Not the joint itself, but just kind of the skin the whole area back there um and I found this tick I brought I brought it in with me if you wanted to have a look at it um it's in like this little plastic container uh and I don't really know when I got it I was hiking on Friday, and then Saturday I was out in my garden. I hope they're not around my house. I hope that it was from hiking and not gardening, but I did spend a lot of time outside on Saturday as well. Okay, so it sounds like it's been a little bit of time since you were last outdoors 21st noticed it. Yeah. Okay. So when you picked it off the tick, obviously you have it for me. Is it quite swollen or engorged? It's not too bad. Um, I, I have actually had a tick in the past and uh this is a long time ago, and maybe like 10 years, and I actually had that kind of target rash thing that they talk about.

P: We were uh in Strathroy along the creek.

D: OK. I can do, if I remember there's a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario and we can see exactly how that lines up to see if we should be a little bit concerned or not. Looks like Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point, so I think that we will be moving forward with antibiotics, but of course we'll be talking to the physician who'll be having a look at you as well. So it sounds like you haven't been having too much symptoms aside from you've noticed this tick, the skin around it is fairly sore and you've had this in the past, but you were treated with antibiotics in the past and since then you haven't had too many health problems after that?

P: No, no. I've been pretty healthy.

D: OK, and just about your health right now, is there anything that you see the family physician or doctor for in general and regarding your health?

P: Uh just for my cholesterol.

D: OK, are you taking and medications for that?

P: Uh Yeah, I take a uh statin, can't remember which one. 

D: OK, got it. And do you have any allergies?

P: Uh no.

D: So no drug allergies?

P: No.

D: OK, now we've already talked about other exposures, so it doesn't sound like anyone else in your family or any pets are around, so it's unlikely that you have ticks coming in and you said you might have gotten this from gardening, but um you're hoping that your area doesn't have ticks. Maybe just take a look, ticks like to live in long grass, kind of on the intersection between woods and fields to see if there's any hovering around that kind of make a waving motion with their legs and they're sometimes easy to spot, you might wanna get some insecticide out there. But it sounds like this is fairly recent, unfortunately just for the length of time this tick might be on you for, it's probably safer than not to start you on some medications, but I'm going to go talk to the doctor after we do a quick physical exam, and we might also send the tick off to a local laboratory so they can identify the species for it definitively, as well as might just send some blood work just to see if there's any titres or any serology that would make us a little bit more concerned for Lyme disease. But aside from that you've been feeling well otherwise?

P: Yeah, totally fine. It was just a little tender there and that's the only reason I looked.

D: OK. So no headaches?

P: No.

D: Nothing like that?

P: Nothing like that. 

D: OK, excellent, alright. I'm fairly happy with what we talked about today. Do you have any questions for me Jean? 

P: No, this is pretty well what I expected today, so thanks for helping me out.

D: No problem. OK, I'll go talk to the doctor, we'll come back and talk to you, OK? 

P: Great, thanks.

D: Thanks Jean.","D: So I understand you removed insects from your leg earlier today?

P: Yes I did, it was uh it was behind my left uh knee kind of in like the joint behind where it bends. Um it was stuck pretty good, it's still kind of red and tender there. I noticed it because the back of my knee was starting to just feel a bit sore, um not the joint itself, but just kind of the skin, the whole area back there. Um and I found this tick, I brought I brought it in with me if you wanted to have a look at it, um it's in like this little plastic container, uh and I don't really know when I got it. I was hiking on Friday um and then Saturday I was out in my garden, I hope they're not around my house, I hope that it was from hiking um and not gardening, but uh I did spend a lot of time outside on Saturday as well.

D: OK, so sounds like it's been a little bit of time since you were last outdoors to when you first noticed it?

P: Yeah.

D: OK, so when you picked it off the tick, obviously you have it for me, is it quite swollen or engorged?

P: It's not too bad, um I I have actually had a tick in the past and this is a long time ago and um maybe like 10 years and I actually had that kind of target rash thing that they talk about. And, uh at that time I remember I had to take antibiotics for a bit. Um this um didn't look like that, it was more, it was just kind of sore in one spot, I don't think it um it was as bad as that time and the tick that time, sorry I've kind of gotten off track, that time it was quite swollen, this one was maybe a little bit, but not as much.

D: OK, so just in terms of the tick's size, it doesn't look like it's been feeding for too long, so when ticks uh are feeding they tend to engorge, they tend to swell up, so this looks more like a tiny little bug or does it kind of look like a little grape, almost like it's been swollen up with blood?

P: No, this one, this one's pretty small.

D: This one's pretty small, OK. And I should mention that, well obviously you've had a tick bite in the past, the big concern for us is a disease called Lyme disease, which is spread by bacteria, but in fact only one type of tick predominantly is a transmission transmitory agent for it. It's called a deer tick, and its coloration, it's got a little bit of a brown butt and there's some black legs. Does it look like that at all?

P: I don't think so, uhm, I uh I was looking at the pictures online, I think it looks like the other kind of tick, um but I heard that, yeah, but I heard that lately now they've been considering all ticks in this area as possibly carriers of Lyme um because I think it's kind of become more more of a problem sm so that was making me a bit nervous.

D: OK, absolutely, what we can do is we can send this tick off to the lab and they'll be able to identify the species for it, but for tick bites in general, one of the key considerations is for how long it's been on your body for. So unfortunately, if you're out on Friday and Saturday, that'd mean that this tick has been on you for longer than at least 72 hours. So I think one way or another, we're likely going to have to put you on antibiotics just as kind of a prophylactic at the very least, just want to make sure that um you're not at risk of developing Lyme disease. I'm sure you've heard from the news that Lyme disease can present in a variety of ways, but it's a disease that we try our best to avoid. And just in terms of your symptoms, so you say you've had a bite in the past and you you've got that rash before, that kind of bullseye rash, do you have that rash now?

P: No, I don't uh as far as I know, I mean, you can have a look too. It's behind my knee, so it's not the easiest place to see, but it's uh it looks a little red, it's like tender where the tick was, but I don't see that like larger circle rash.

D: OK, that's reassuring. Now any, it'd be pretty unlikely for you to have other symptoms, but just in case, do you have any other joint pain? 

P: No.

D: Have you been feeling ill or have been feverish in the last little while?

P: No, no, I've been fine.

D: OK, and you removed that twit tick once you found it, you presented to me, have you checked your body for any other possible bites?

P: Oh yeah, I looked around and I looked at my husband too 'cause we we were just a little bit, you know, gave us a little bit of a scare, but no, there's been nothing else.

D: That's good. And did you bring a pet with you at all when you were hiking and gardening?

P: Uh no, I didn't, no.

D: OK, good. Any other family members you think might have been exposed?

P: Uh no it was just uh me and my husband.

D: OK, and what geographic area were you in um when you were hiking?

MSK0041,/home/kelechi/bio_ramp_asr/data/uk_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/MSK0041.mp3,"D: How may I help you? 

P: I'm I am here because I've had this intense pain in my right foot for the past six hours or so or so, and I thought it was important to come get it checked out by you guys.

D: OK, so you say it started six hours ago has the pain been getting better or getting worse?

P: Um alcohol have about. I usually have about 2 glasses of wine a day.

D: OK, and has that changed recently for you.

P: No, not really. I've just been I've also been start drinking like a beer every day as well recently.

D: OK. Alright, and alright could you tell me a little bit about your living situation right now who you're living with and and where?

P: I live with my son in a house.

D: OK, uh, and have you been around anybody who's been sick? 

P: No. 

D: Alright, and have you traveled anywhere recently?

P: Um no no travel recently. 

D: OK, and and can you tell me a little bit about your diet an and like do you eat a lot of red meat and or a lot of seafood like like shell shellfish?

P: I eat a lot of red meats. But not a lot of um seafood.

D: OK. And. OK, and anybody in the family have a history of musculoskeletal or or neurological conditions?

P: Um so. Who OK, so my my father had like arthritis and I don't remember what kind of arthritis he had but he had severe arthritis. He also had high blood pressure and diabetes, and on my mother's side. Um there is some arthritis there as well and as well as gout and kidney stones.

D: OK.  So that that was everything I wanted to ask all the history. And so, uh, next to ask you to have a look at your feet. And are you seeing any swelling, redness, or discolouration?

P: I see some redness and uh, some swelling in that area.

D: OK, and are you feeling any temperature changes?

P: Yes, and the right one is definitely warmer than the left.

D: OK, then how about any muscle atrophy in the foot or or lower leg or any joint malalignment or deformities?

P: Uh, so in terms of deformity is like it just looks swollen and so there's like a big bump on the right side of my foot, whereas it's completely straight on my left, but other than that, no deformities.

D: OK, and if you were to a palpate or press on areas of your foot or joints of your toes, are you feeling any any pains along the top of your foot or or in any of your other toes?

P: None of my other toes.

D: OK, and how about any pains at the ankle?

P: Um no pain at the ankle.

D: OK, so the metatarsals are not having any pain and then the joints of the 2nd 5th digits are pain free along with the ankle as well. Um and when it comes to range of motion, are you able to flex your toes downwards and extend them upwards towards your nose?

P: Yes, I can do that.

D: OK, and how about your ankle, are you able to um move your ankle on a full range of motion.

P: I can.

D: OK, and are you having a limping with, walking or otherwise called an antalgic gait?

P: Somewhat because I'm trying not to put too much weight on my right big toe.

D: OK. Alright, and so I think that was everything that I wanted to ask and check today. So did you have any other questions or anything that I maybe forgot to ask about you wanted to mention today?

P: Um no just what can I do for my foot how do I make the swelling go down?

D: Yeah, for sure it's so right now with having a like a red, warm and swollen joint that that's extremely tender and has limited range of motion. It's important to rule out a septic arthritis, however. Based on several of the risk factors such as diabetes, and obesity, as well as your family history of arthritis and gout. Taking the most likely thing is that this is a gout flare, and in particular in the toe like that it could be called podagra and so we will need to get a aspiration of the joint fluid just to send it off and make sure that it's not not an infection and that we're treating the right thing. If this is, gout and it comes back that this way it's treated with that high dose, high doses of anti inflammatories. I will start with medication called colchicine to help with this flare, and in the meantime, important things for preventing this in the future are diet and kind of lifestyle related with reducing things like red meats, alcohol, weight loss and um just trying to improve the diabetes management as well.

P: OK, that sounds great. Thank you.

Like, I feel like it's definitely worse this time, but uh, at that time I didn't even go to the doctor. It kind of just went away. Okay. I see. And have you had any reasons for hospitalizations? No hospitalizations, no. And any surgeries? Nope. Alright. And could you tell me whereabouts you're living currently and who you're living with? Yeah, so I'm currently living in an apartment by myself, and just outside of London. Okay. And anybody that you've been around who's had any symptoms? No, not that I know of. Okay. And have you traveled anywhere out of the city or province? No, I've tried to stay home. Besides going to work, I just work at the grocery store. Besides that, nowhere else. Okay. And anybody you, any of your or twice I smoke a joint. Okay. And anybody in the family have any lung or heart conditions? No, not that I know of. Alright. And how about any cancer in the family? No, no, no cancers. Okay. I think that was everything I wanted to ask about today. Was there any other symptoms or anything else that you wanted to make sure I knew about today? No, I think that's all. I just didn't know if I needed any medications or if I needed to get tested. I just wanted to make sure. Yeah, so we'll certainly check your temperature to see if you have a fever. And if you do, and it's high enough, that will increase the chance that you have a bacterial sinusitis with, and if so, with some of your symptoms including the discharge, obstruction, loss of smell, and facial pain, that all fits the picture for it. And also you felt, you had a period where you felt a little bit better and then worse again. So that might require antibiotics, but we will check your temperature and go from there. Alright, sounds good. Thank you so much."," How may I help you? I am here because I've had this intense pain in my right foot for the past six hours or so, and I thought it was important to come get it checked out by you guys. Okay. So it started six hours ago.

Just the lithotripsy for the kidney stone. Okay. And are your immunizations up to date? Yep, they are. Excellent. Okay. And do you smoke cigarettes no i don't how about uh marijuana or using uh other cannabis products no okay and do you use any recreational drugs i know okay um and how about alcohol um how many drinks per week would you have usually Alcohol, have a drink. okay um and how about alcohol um how many drinks per week would you have usually um alcohol i'll have about i usually have about two glasses of wine a day okay and has that changed uh recently for you um no not really i've just been um I've also been drinking like a beer every day as well recently okay um all right and um could you tell me a little bit about your living situation right now, like who you're living with and where? I live with my son in a house. Okay. And have you been around anybody who's been sick? No. All right. And have you traveled anywhere recently uh no no travel recently okay um and can you tell me a little bit about your diet and and like do you eat a lot of red meat and uh or a lot of uh seafoods like like self shellfish uh i eat a lot of, uh, seafoods, like, like shellfish? Uh, I eat a lot of red meat, um, but not a lot of, um, seafood. Okay. Um, and, um, okay. Anybody in the family have a history of musculoskeletal or neurological conditions? Um, so, who, okay, so my, my father had arthritis, and I don't remember what kind of arthritis he had, but he had severe arthritis. He also had high blood pressure and diabetes. and on my mother's side um there's some arthritis there as well, and as well as gout and kidney stones. Okay. So that was everything I wanted to ask on the history. And so next I'll ask you to have a look at your feet and are you seeing any swelling, redness or discoloration? I see some redness and some swelling in that area. Okay. And are you feeling any temperature changes? Yes. The right one is definitely warmer than the left. Okay. And how about any muscle atrophy in the foot or lower leg or any joint malalignment or deformities um so in terms of um deformities like it just looks swollen and um so there's like a big bump on the right side of my foot whereas uh it's completely straight on my left but other than that no deformities okay um and if you're to uh palpate or press on um areas of your foot or or joints of your toes are you feeling any um any pains along the top of your foot or or in any of your other, are you feeling any, um, any pains along the top of your foot or, or in any of your other toes? None of my other toes. Okay. And how about any pains, uh, at the ankle? Uh, no pain at the ankle. Okay. So the metatarsals, um, are not having any pain and then the joints of um the second to fifth digits are pain-free uh along with the ankle as well um and when it comes to range of motion are you able to flex your toes downwards and extend them upwards towards your nose yes i can do that okay and how about your ankle are you able to um um move your ankle in a full range of motion i can okay and uh are you having uh limping with walking or otherwise called it an antalgic gait? Um, somewhat because I'm trying not to put too much, um, weight on my right big toe. Okay. Um, all right. And so I think that was everything that I wanted to ask and check today. So did you have any other questions or anything that I maybe forgot to ask about you wanted to mention today? No, just what can I do for my foot? How do I make the swelling go down? yeah for sure it's uh so right now um with having a like a red um warm and swollen joint that's that's extremely tender and has limited uh range of motion we it's important to rule out a septic arthritis. However, based on several of the risk factors, such as diabetes and obesity, as well as your family history of arthritis and gout, um thinking the most likely thing is that this is um a gout flare and in particular in the toe like that it could be called podegra um and so we'll need to get a uh aspiration of the joint fluid just to send it off and make sure that it's not's not an infection and that we're treating the right thing. If this is gout and it comes back this way, it's treated with high doses of anti-inflammatories. And we'll start with a medication called Colchicine to help with this flare. And in the meantime, important things for preventing this in the future are diet and kind of lifestyle related with reducing things like red meats, weight loss and just trying to improve the diabetes management as well okay that sounds great thank you all right thank you we'll get that started","D: How may I help you?

MSK0045,/home/kelechi/bio_ramp_asr/data/uk_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/MSK0045.mp3,"D: What brings you here today?

P: Um so I'm here because my shoulder has been really painful for the past week um and any movement of that shoulder, of my right shoulder, causes a lot of pain.

D: OK, and how long have you been having uh this pain for?

P: For the past week,

D: Past week, OK. Um and did you injure your shoulder at all recently? Any trauma to the area or anything like that?

P: Um so about like, a couple of months ago, I um was do, I I work in construction so um I was moving around some heavy objects and um I guess like the repetitive motions caused some sort of rotator cuff injury. But I had that um, like I got that treated and everything was fine for a couple of months. But this pain just started a week ago.

D: OK, and where is this pain located exactly?

P: Um it's it's just like in my shoulder, like at the joint between my upper arm and um shoulder.

D: OK, and uh is it an aching pain or is it a sharp stabbing pain?

P: So at rest it seems to be like achy and stiff, but um but when I move my shoulder, when I try to move it, it it causes more of a sharp pain.

D: Sharp pain, OK and what kind of movements cause the sharp pain? Or is it just any movement?

P: Uh any movement.

D:  OK. Are there any uh movements that are worse in particular?

P: Um I think um, like no, anything hurts.

D: OK. OK, and how much would you rate this pain out, on a scale of zero to 10, 10 being the worst pain you felt in your life?

P: I'd give it about a 7. 

D: Seven, OK.

P: Yeah.

D: And are you having uh, is this pain moving to any other uh joints or any other part of your body?

P: No. 

D: OK, so just just in the area that you described?

P: Yes. 

D: OK, and do you notice any kind of um, just looking at your shoulder outside, from the outside, any swelling, redness, any masses or deformities?

P: No, I don't see anything like that.

D: OK, alright and um is there anything that you've tried that has helped with your pain?

P: Um I've tried some ibuprofen, some ice. It seems to help temporarily.

D: OK, and earlier when you had the rotator cuff injury, did you get physiotherapy? 

P: Um I did. But not, but I didn't finish the full course. I just went for a week or so and then um I had to go back to work, um so I stopped doing that.

D: I see, um yeah, so that's something definitely uh it's very important and we'll need to consider going forward as well. Other than that, are you having any symptoms of any fevers or chills?

P: Uh no, nothing like that.

D: OK, and have you been sick recently at all or met with someone who was sick?

P: No.

D: OK, any any weight loss um or loss of appetite? Anything like that?

P: Uh no, nothing like that.

D: OK, any numbness or tingling? 

P: No.

D: Any weakness in your extremities?

P: No.

D: Any um any just symptoms or anything else like diarrhea, constipation, urinary changes? Anything else is going on?
 
P: No. 

D: No, OK. So it's mainly just the shoulder pain?

P: Yes. 

D: OK, um alright, and does rest help at all, like when you're lying down, just not moving your shoulder. Does that help with your pain?

P: Uh, yeah I would say so.

D: OK. And is is this stiffness there just throughout the day, or is it there in the morning and then gets better during the day?

P: It's pretty much there all day.

D: OK. Alright um and have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?

P: Uh, I have um, I have diabetes, but that's about it.

D: OK, and do you take any medications?

P: I'm on metformin. 

D: OK. Um and do you have any allergies to any medications?

P: No, no allergies to medications.

D: Have you been hospitalized or had any surgeries in the past? 

P: No. 

D: No, OK. Um any family history of any musculoskeletal or rheumatological conditions?

P: No. 

D: OK, and currently right now, so you said you work as a construction worker, right?

P: Yes.

D: And are you off of work right now, or have you been off work um due to your previous injury and pain, or are you still working?

P: I'm still working, but modified, um so I am not uh lifting any heavy objects or anything like that. I'm just doing some like groundwork.

D: OK, that's good. Yeah, I mean, um we might also need to, if you're doing any kind of overhead like work where you're raising your arms above your shoulders, that might uh, cause further problems as well, so we'll look into some of those modified duties as well.

P: OK.

D: Um yeah, and what is your living situation like right now? Who do you live with?

P: Um I live by myself right now.

D: Do you live in a house or apartment?

P: Um I live in an apartment. 

D: And, uh, uh, in terms of your daily life, do you smoke at all?

P: Um I don't smoke. I used to smoke before, but that was like 20 years ago.

D: OK, that's good, and do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana or any other drugs?

P: Uh no, no.

D: How about smoking, you smoke cigarettes? Sorry, you said you you quit. Um do you drink alcohol?

P: I'll drink like a glass of wine here and there.

D: OK. Alright, um yeah, and those were some of the questions I had for you. In terms of just a physical examination, uh when you press on the area that you describe, um when you press around the area, does it hurt?

P: I have to press pretty hard for it to hurt.

D: OK, but otherwise it's not tender?

P: No.

D: OK, and again, no swelling, redness, or anything like that, just it's mainly just on the inside?

P: Yeah.

D: OK, and um and any kind of movement hurts, right? There's no particular movement that, like if you were instead of um trying to raise that shoulder by itself, if you were to just move it with the other arm. Does it hurt?

P: The other arm? The other arm doesn't hurt at all.

D: Or like if you were to use your left arm to to passively move your right arm and shoulder. Does that hurt or is it when you just try to move the right arm by itself?

P: It's, oh, it still hurts, any any moving of the shoulder hurts.

D:  OK, alright, so yeah, so based on what um you've told me so far in your recent shoulder cuff injury, what can sometimes happen is uh with those injuries, you might get some um inflammation and what might happen is something called uh adhesive capsulitis, or just commonly knows as known as a frozen shoulder. And there's different stages, so that might happen, so in the initial stages like freezing um and then there's stiffening in stage two, and then usually after 6 to 12 months it starts uh getting better.

P: OK.

D: Um and it might also affect your other shoulder as well. So what we'll um end up doing today is see if um we can get some um imaging done so we can do an X-Ray of your shoulder. I'm sure you've had X Rays before, so we'll kind of compare them to your shoulder X Rays from before. We, if we need to, we can also get an ultrasound if um we don't, uh we can't really tell from the X Rays. And then from there, um we can get some blood work as well. Um just your normal blood work as well as inflammation markers, and then um from there we'll need to uh, really um discuss some management strategies. So you've already tried some physiotherapy, but now we need to make sure that's uh, it's it's consistent because this is something that has a high recurrence rate and we will definitely need to finish the full course of physiotherapy, whatever it may be, um because if physiotherapy doesn't work, we may have to consider like other options like um corticosteroid injections right into your shoulder.

P: OK. 

D: For some relief.  But yeah, so first we'll just try some conservative methods like physiotherapy, pain management, uh and then go from there. How does that sound?

P: That sounds pretty good. Thank you.

D: Welcome, alright, so we'll call you for the X-Rays and then we'll go from there.

P: OK, sounds good.",682.612625,us_medical,"What brings you in? Yeah, so yeah, I'm just coming in with my son. He's been having, he's been complaining of just, seems like pain in his right ear for the last, I would say, three to four days. And it seems like he's just more irritable, just not himself right now. Yeah, okay. So how long did you say he's had this ear pain? I would say four days now. Four days? Okay. Have you noticed any hearing loss? No, he still responds when I call his name. Okay. Have you noticed any fluid coming out of his ears? No, I don't think so. And is it more like one side of his ears or both ears? It's just his right ear. Just his right ear? Okay. And have you taken a look inside his ears? Yeah, I tried to take a look with a flashlight. I couldn't really see too much. Okay. And you mentioned he's had a runny nose too. When did that start? Yeah, so that kind of like, like it was just a cold and he had a runny nose and just was a bit congested. But then over the last week, it kind of just resolved. But then this week he started having just this ear pain. Okay. Any fevers? No, not that I haven't measured anything and he hasn't mentioned anything like, he hasn't felt cold or anything like that. No. Any weight loss over the past month or so? No. No. Any change in his hair or nails like rashes or skin? Yeah, no. No changes in his skin. Okay. Any changes in his vision or smell or taste? No. No. His runny nose, what color is it? Okay. Good. Does he have a sore throat at all? No, not that he's told me. He's still eating things like, and I don't think he's having any trouble with eating anything, so I don't think so. Okay. Has he had a cough? Actually, yeah, he did, he did start coughing like yesterday but like just a few times a day. I don't know if it's because of this or like what else might be going on. Okay. And you said for the past few days he's had the cough? Yeah, I think it just maybe started yesterday. Started yesterday. Okay. Is it a dry cough or is it bringing up any phlegm? No, it seems to be just dry. And Has he had any ear infections recently? No. Has he had any ear pain before? He did have a similar ear pain when he was around three years old. Has he had any other ear infections? No. Is he otherwise healthy? No. Any hospitalizations or surgeries? No. Is he on any medications? No. Is he up to date with all his immunizations? Yes. Any allergies? No. Any family history of lung or heart conditions? No longer heart conditions. His father does have celiac disease. How old was he when he was diagnosed with celiac? Fairly young, in his 20s. Do you live with you and your partner? Yes. Do you live in an apartment or a house? Condominium. Any old carpet, mold, or asbestos in the building? No. Is he otherwise, like, developmental wise, he's okay? No issues from when he was younger. No complications during your pregnancy with him? No. Was it a vaginal birth? Yes. Did you need to stay in the hospital afterwards? No. Okay. So those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own? Yeah. I don't know if last time we did get some antibiotics. I don't know if he needs them right now. What would you recommend? Yeah. So I'm gonna have to take a look into his ears first before I can come up with a management plan for him. So once I do, if I see him. If his tympanic membrane has been perforated or I see pus in there, we'll prescribe him like 10 days of antibiotics. We can give him either amoxicillin or if he has bad reactions to penicillin, we can give him cefuroxime. And then if it doesn't seem to have any systemic symptoms, so if he has systemic symptoms like fever, which we'll check for today, and if he's been really ill and he has a middle ear effusion or bulging tympanic membrane, again we'll give him antibiotics for 10 days. But if his tympanic membrane is just bulging a little bit or if he has some middle ear effusion but no systemic symptoms like no fevers and he seems to be fine otherwise, we'll reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see if he's better and if he's not, again we'll prescribe him antibiotics.

P: Um I don't smoke. I used to smoke before, but that was like 20 years ago.

D: OK, that's good, and do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana or any other drugs?

P: Uh no, no.

D: How about smoking, you smoke cigarettes? Sorry, you said you you quit. Um do you drink alcohol?

P: I'll drink like a glass of wine here and there.

D: OK. Alright, um yeah, and those were some of the questions I had for you. In terms of just a physical examination, uh when you press on the area that you describe, um when you press around the area, does it hurt?

P: I have to press pretty hard for it to hurt.

D: OK, but otherwise it's not tender?

P: No.

D: OK, and again, no swelling, redness, or anything like that, just it's mainly just on the inside?

P: Yeah.

D: OK, and um and any kind of movement hurts, right? There's no particular movement that, like if you were instead of um trying to raise that shoulder by itself, if you were to just move it with the other arm. Does it hurt?

P: The other arm? The other arm doesn't hurt at all.

D: Or like if you were to use your left arm to to passively move your right arm and shoulder. Does that hurt or is it when you just try to move the right arm by itself?

P: It's, oh, it still hurts, any any moving of the shoulder hurts.

D:  OK, alright, so yeah, so based on what um you've told me so far in your recent shoulder cuff injury, what can sometimes happen is uh with those injuries, you might get some um inflammation and what might happen is something called uh adhesive capsulitis, or just commonly knows as known as a frozen shoulder. And there's different stages, so that might happen, so in the initial stages like freezing um and then there's stiffening in stage two, and then usually after 6 to 12 months it starts uh getting better.

P: OK.

D: Um and it might also affect your other shoulder as well. So what we'll um end up doing today is see if um we can get some um imaging done so we can do an X-Ray of your shoulder. I'm sure you've had X Rays before, so we'll kind of compare them to your shoulder X Rays from before. We, if we need to, we can also get an ultrasound if um we don't, uh we can't really tell from the X Rays. And then from there, um we can get some blood work as well. Um just your normal blood work as well as inflammation markers, and then um from there we'll need to uh, really um discuss some management strategies. So you've already tried some physiotherapy, but now we need to make sure that's uh, it's it's consistent because this is something that has a high recurrence rate and we will definitely need to finish the full course of physiotherapy, whatever it may be, um because if physiotherapy doesn't work, we may have to consider like other options like um corticosteroid injections right into your shoulder.

P: OK. 

D: For some relief.  But yeah, so first we'll just try some conservative methods like physiotherapy, pain management, uh and then go from there. How does that sound?

P: That sounds pretty good. Thank you.

D: Welcome, alright, so we'll call you for the X-Rays and then we'll go from there.

P: OK, sounds good.","D: What brings you here today?

P: Um so I'm here because my shoulder has been really painful for the past week um and any movement of that shoulder, of my right shoulder, causes a lot of pain.

D: OK, and how long have you been having uh this pain for?

P: For the past week,

D: Past week, OK. Um and did you injure your shoulder at all recently? Any trauma to the area or anything like that?

P: Um so about like, a couple of months ago, I um was do, I I work in construction so um I was moving around some heavy objects and um I guess like the repetitive motions caused some sort of rotator cuff injury. But I had that um, like I got that treated and everything was fine for a couple of months. But this pain just started a week ago.

D: OK, and where is this pain located exactly?

P: Um it's it's just like in my shoulder, like at the joint between my upper arm and um shoulder.

D: OK, and uh is it an aching pain or is it a sharp stabbing pain?

P: So at rest it seems to be like achy and stiff, but um but when I move my shoulder, when I try to move it, it it causes more of a sharp pain.

D: Sharp pain, OK and what kind of movements cause the sharp pain? Or is it just any movement?

P: Uh any movement.

D:  OK. Are there any uh movements that are worse in particular?

P: Um I think um, like no, anything hurts.

D: OK. OK, and how much would you rate this pain out, on a scale of zero to 10, 10 being the worst pain you felt in your life?

P: I'd give it about a 7. 

D: Seven, OK.

P: Yeah.

D: And are you having uh, is this pain moving to any other uh joints or any other part of your body?

P: No. 

D: OK, so just just in the area that you described?

P: Yes. 

D: OK, and do you notice any kind of um, just looking at your shoulder outside, from the outside, any swelling, redness, any masses or deformities?

P: No, I don't see anything like that.

D: OK, alright and um is there anything that you've tried that has helped with your pain?

P: Um I've tried some ibuprofen, some ice. It seems to help temporarily.

D: OK, and earlier when you had the rotator cuff injury, did you get physiotherapy? 

P: Um I did. But not, but I didn't finish the full course. I just went for a week or so and then um I had to go back to work, um so I stopped doing that.

D: I see, um yeah, so that's something definitely uh it's very important and we'll need to consider going forward as well. Other than that, are you having any symptoms of any fevers or chills?

P: Uh no, nothing like that.

D: OK, and have you been sick recently at all or met with someone who was sick?

P: No.

D: OK, any any weight loss um or loss of appetite? Anything like that?

P: Uh no, nothing like that.

D: OK, any numbness or tingling? 

P: No.

D: Any weakness in your extremities?

P: No.

D: Any um any just symptoms or anything else like diarrhea, constipation, urinary changes? Anything else is going on?
 
P: No. 

D: No, OK. So it's mainly just the shoulder pain?

P: Yes. 

D: OK, um alright, and does rest help at all, like when you're lying down, just not moving your shoulder. Does that help with your pain?

P: Uh, yeah I would say so.

D: OK. And is is this stiffness there just throughout the day, or is it there in the morning and then gets better during the day?

P: It's pretty much there all day.

D: OK. Alright um and have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?

P: Uh, I have um, I have diabetes, but that's about it.

D: OK, and do you take any medications?

P: I'm on metformin. 

D: OK. Um and do you have any allergies to any medications?

P: No, no allergies to medications.

D: Have you been hospitalized or had any surgeries in the past? 

P: No. 

D: No, OK. Um any family history of any musculoskeletal or rheumatological conditions?

P: No. 

D: OK, and currently right now, so you said you work as a construction worker, right?

P: Yes.

D: And are you off of work right now, or have you been off work um due to your previous injury and pain, or are you still working?

P: I'm still working, but modified, um so I am not uh lifting any heavy objects or anything like that. I'm just doing some like groundwork.

D: OK, that's good. Yeah, I mean, um we might also need to, if you're doing any kind of overhead like work where you're raising your arms above your shoulders, that might uh, cause further problems as well, so we'll look into some of those modified duties as well.

P: OK.

D: Um yeah, and what is your living situation like right now? Who do you live with?

P: Um I live by myself right now.

D: Do you live in a house or apartment?

P: Um I live in an apartment. 

D: And, uh, uh, in terms of your daily life, do you smoke at all?

P: Um I don't smoke. I used to smoke before, but that was like 20 years ago.

D: OK, that's good, and do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana or any other drugs?

P: Uh no, no.

D: How about smoking, you smoke cigarettes? Sorry, you said you you quit. Um do you drink alcohol?

P: I'll drink like a glass of wine here and there.

D: OK. Alright, um yeah, and those were some of the questions I had for you. In terms of just a physical examination, uh when you press on the area that you describe, um when you press around the area, does it hurt?

P: I have to press pretty hard for it to hurt.

D: OK, but otherwise it's not tender?

P: No.

D: OK, and again, no swelling, redness, or anything like that, just it's mainly just on the inside?

RES0096,/home/kelechi/bio_ramp_asr/data/uk_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/RES0096.mp3,"D: Uh, how can I help you?

P: Uh, I have just been feeling very short of breath recently.

D: OK.

P: And I thought I should come in. I've also had a, I've also had a cough.

D: I see. OK, uhm, and when does this shortness of breath, uhm, come on? How, how much activity are you able to do?

P: Uhm, I can walk a block.

D: OK.

P: Without being short of breath.

D: And prior to this change, how far were you able to walk and and how long ago did you, did you notice this change?

P: Uhm, I, I guess I could walk, uh, I don't know, it's been very, I guess it's, it's been a gradual change. Uhm, maybe a month, a month ago I felt that I couldn't really walk as much as I used to, and then it's only gotten worse. Two or three months ago I could, I could walk a kilometre or two, or more.

D: OK, so quite a significant change over the last little while. Have you had any episodes where you wake up in the middle of the night with, with shortness of breath, and you need to sit up? 

P: No.

D: OK, and how many pillows do you sleep with?

P: One.

D: OK and have you noticed any like ankle swelling or or leg swelling?

P: No. 

D: OK. And you mentioned cough. When did that start?

P: I've had a cough for a while, the past five, ten years, but I feel that it's been a little bit more frequent now. It's just, I just get into this coughing fit and I think there was a time when I had a little bit of blood come out as well, once or twice. The coughing also makes it difficult for me to breathe, you know, I feel very short of breath after that.

D: Yeah, certainly, uhm, how much blood have you coughed up?

P: Oh, I don't know. I think it was it was a little bit.

D: Did it happen each time, or has it only been a couple of times?

P: I think maybe, two or three times but then there have also been times when I cough up this, this stuff that I cough up is a little bit pink in color. It's not exactly blood, but it's, it's, you know, pinkish.

D: OK, and are you producing sputum each time you're coughing up?

P: Most of the times, yes.

D: OK, is this a change from previously? Did you have a dry cough before?

P: A bit more of a dry cough before, but I mean, so sometimes it will be a dry cough sometimes, uh, it was more of a wet cough, but it was, it was usually just this white thing coming up. It wasn't like, there was never blood before.

D: OK, and you're coughing more often as well over this last month?

P: Oh yeah, Oh yeah, 

D: OK. Have you been experiencing any, any headaches?

P: Nope. 

D: Any runny nose or sore throat?

P: no.

P: Uhm, I, I checked my fevers, I checked my temperature uh, couple days ago. It's just been this little bit, 30, I think it was 38. 

D: OK, so, yeah, that would be a fever.

P: That was I think two weeks ago.

D: OK, do you feel hot now?

P: Not really, no. 

D: OK. Have you had any night sweats?

P: Uh, no.

D: And have you had any weight loss over the last several months?

P: Oh, yeah.

D: How much weight?

P: About 20 pounds.

D: OK, and so how, How long was that weight loss over?

P: I'd say about about, uh, three, three-four months?

D: OK and sorry, what was your starting weight, roughly?

P: Yeah, yeah I was, uhm, 210 pounds.

D: OK, uhm, so yeah, about a 10% reduction in your weight over the last couple of months, it sounds like. OK, How is your appetite been?

P: Uh, it's OK.

P: No. 

D: Any, any wheeze? 

P: No.

P: Yeah, I've been diagnosed with COPD, with, uh, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.

D: I see, alright and do you take any medications for those? 

P: Uh, I take Lipitor.

D: OK.

P And I take some puffers but don't use them very frequently. I forget to use them. And they, I tried them, but they haven't been very helpful these past two months.

D: OK, so yeah, you've tried them, when you were short of breath and they haven't helped?

P: They haven't done much. 

D: OK. And are you allergic to any medications or have any allergies?

P: Uhm, no.

D: Alright, and have you been hospitalized for any reason, or like, including COPD exacerbation?

P: Oh yeah, yeah.

D: Or any similar symptoms?

P: It's been, uh, I was, uh, I was actually hospitalized about four or five times last year.

D: And was this for COPD exacerbations?

D: OK, did those each require a stay in the hospital?

P: Two or three of them I did, yeah. 

D: OK. And have you had any surgeries? 

P: Uh, no.

D: And are you currently smoking? 

P: Yeah.

D: OK, how much do you smoke per day?

P: I've got it down quite a bit. I only have two cigarettes a day. I used to have a pack and a half, Uh, but I've got it down a lot. I'm trying to, I'm trying to quit, but it's hard.

D: Yeah, for sure it's great that you're working towards quitting. We can discuss that further and there are several options that might be available to help if it's something you're interested in, because yeah, it's definitely really hard. Are you, do you drink alcohol?

P: Uh, once in a while, on Christmas.

D: OK, and do you use any recreational drugs?

P: No.

D: You smoke marijuana or use marijuana products?

P: No.

D: Alright, and who are you living with currently?

P: I live with my wife.

D: OK, and are you, uhm, do you help looking after the home, and uh, like functionally independent right now?

P: Uh, yeah. I use a cane. 

D: Mhm, ok.

P: And uh, yeah, my, my son comes over and helps out with groceries and my wife cooks but, I, I help her with cleaning sometimes.

D: OK, great and, so are you retired?

P: yep.

D: OK, uhm, and has anybody in the family had any heart or lung conditions?

P: My dad died of lung cancer. He was a, he was a big smoker as well. And my mom had a heart attack. 

D: OK, and how old were your parents approximately?

P: Yeah, my dad was 65 and my mom was, was very young, she was 50.

D: I see. Did your mom survive the heart attack?

P: No, no she did not.

D: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Uhm, and the lung cancer you mention, any other cancers that run in the family?

P: No. 

D: OK, so that was all the questions I wanted to ask on on history. Uhm certainly it sounds like you're bringing up some blood with, with, with the increased cough and with difficulties breathing so we will get a, uhm, a chest x-ray and possibly a CT image of your chest as well to see if there's anything going on in your lungs and we might do some blood work as well to check a few things so uhm, we'll get those ordered and, and see what, see what that shows.

P: Thank you.",699.520875,us_medical,"What brings you in? I brought my son in today because he had a fever that started two days ago and then since then he has had a cough that started as well and he has been short of breath. It looks like he's breathing faster and just having a harder time to breathe. Okay. Before the fever, did you notice any other symptoms like a runny nose or a stuffy nose? No, nothing like that. Yeah, the fever kind of came on pretty pretty suddenly. It seemed like... Okay. And you took his temperature at home? Yeah, it was like, um, like 38.7 and then like, two days ago and then it was high again, like yesterday and today. Okay. And you mentioned the cough started soon after the fever, correct? Yeah, kind of like the day after he started getting this cough. Okay. And is it a dry cough or a productive cough? It's, um, yeah, he is bringing up a little bit of sputum. Yeah, it's maybe like greenish, greenish yellow. Greenish yellow. Okay. And is there any blood in there? No, I haven't noticed any, any blood. Okay. And does he seem short of breath or wheezy? No wheezing, but he does have some shortness of breath. Okay. And the shortness of breath started with a cough? Yeah, it did. Okay. How much shortness of breath is he having? Is it just when he's exerting himself or is it at rest as well? I'd say, yeah, even at rest now, he's breathing faster. Okay. And does anything help with that? So, does sitting up help or getting fresh air or anything like that? No, but you would say like taking, uh, smaller breaths helps because like if he takes a deep breath then he gets, like, chest pain. Okay. Okay. And how about when he's lying down? No, he hasn't said anything like that for lying down, just I think when he's just taking a deep breath he said, okay. Is it waking him up from sleep? No, no. Okay. How about chest pain? Yeah, so yeah, he's had some pain when he takes that deep breath. Okay. Does he ever feel like his heart is racing? No. No. Okay. How about dizziness or fainting spells? No, he hasn't had anything like that. Okay. Has he had any sore throat? So those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own? No, I don't think so. The only other thing that I forgot to mention is that his appetite has been a little bit lower the last couple of days, but he hasn't had any nausea or vomiting. Okay, okay, yeah, that's good to know. So because some of his symptoms overlap with those of COVID, we will do a swab on him and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results. And he should isolate for 14 days because of those symptoms. It sounds more in keeping with the picture of community acquired pneumonia. So for that, we will get a chest x-ray, we will check his oxygen and his temperature. And if the chest x-ray shows consolidation or some sort of infiltrate, it is likely that he has pneumonia. So we will start by giving him some amoxicillin or cephalexin. if you are oxime for five days and just keep monitoring his symptoms they should resolve in about five days when the course of antibiotics is complete. If his condition gets worse like he's getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures just take him to the ER and if his symptoms don't resolve in five to seven days we can do further workup for things like fungal infections or TB or things like that. How does that sound? That sounds great. Thank you. Okay, yeah, no problem."," How can I help you? I have just been feeling very short of breath recently. Okay. And I thought I should come in. I've also had a cough. I see. Okay. And when does this shortness of breath come on? How much activity are you able to do? I can walk a block. Okay. Without any short of breath.

P: No, I haven't.

D: OK. Have you been feeling any chest pain at all?

P: Uh, no, I, I I haven't had any chest pain.

P: Uh I would say, yeah, maybe three or four teaspoons every every couple hours.

D: OK, are you producing any blood like in your cough or sputum at all?

P: No, it wasn't really red, it's kinda orange.

D: Orange, OK. Any greenish or yellow material?

P: No, I haven't noticed anything like that.

D: OK. Uhm, any anything that makes your symptoms better or worse that you've tried?

P: I did try some over the counter cold medicine. It, I think it might have helped me sleep last night, but didn't really do a whole lot.

D: Alright and, if if you're while you're here, if your shortness of breath gets any worse at all, just let us know and we'll help you out.

P: OK, thank you, will do.

D: Thank you, bye.

P: Bye.","D: Can you tell me what brings you in here today?

P: So I've had this, uh, this cough that it started two days ago and it's been getting worse. I've been bringing up this rust colored sputum. 

D: OK, and so that's been going on for a few days?

P: Yeah, yeah about two days. 

D: OK, and how often are you coughing?

P: It's it's happening all day. Really, throughout the day and really any type of exertion or or movement, I'm getting short of breath and it's triggering a cough.

D: OK, and the shortness of breath, is it just with the exertion or it can, is it happening at rest? How are you feeling right now?

P: Yeah, even right now it feels like I'm not able to get, I don't know, a full breath, it just feels like it's more difficult to to breathe.

D: OK, have you felt any kind of dizziness or fainting episodes? 

P: No, I haven't.

D: OK. Have you been feeling any chest pain at all?

P: Uh, no, I, I I haven't had any chest pain.

D: OK, and so with your coughing you're producing the rust colored sputum, but how much would you say you're producing?

P: Uh I would say, yeah, maybe three or four teaspoons every every couple hours.

D: OK, are you producing any blood like in your cough or sputum at all?

P: No, it wasn't really red, it's kinda orange.

D: Orange, OK. Any greenish or yellow material?

P: No, I haven't noticed anything like that.

D: OK. Any fevers or chills?

P: Yeah, I have had, I've had both of those. I've had a I I checked my temperature this morning and it was 38.2 and I was pretty chilly last night. 

D: OK. Uhm, and before these symptoms started, were you having any similar symptoms at all before?

P: Ah, no, I mean a few weeks ago, probably like a yeah a couple of weeks ago I had a runny nose. And and sore throat for a couple of days. It went away on its own though.

D: OK. Uhm, any anything that makes your symptoms better or worse that you've tried?

P: I did try some over the counter cold medicine. It, I think it might have helped me sleep last night, but didn't really do a whole lot.

D: OK, does your shortness of breath improve with any positions or does it improve when you're not exerting yourself?

P: Uh, not really. It's kind of always there, 

D: It's ok. Do you have to wake up at night to take a deep breath? Or do you feel any kind of shortness of breath with laying down at all?

P: No, I haven't had any issues like that.

D: OK and do you notice any kind of swelling in your feet, ankles, arms, legs, anything like that?

P: No, I haven't.

D: OK, have you been in contact with anyone that's sick recently?

P: Uh, I don't I, I mean I see my granddaughter and I might have got a cold from her a few weeks ago, but recently I haven't seen anybody.

D: OK, are you having any night sweats?

P: No, just a chills last night.

D: OK. Are you breathing faster?

P: Yeah, I have felt like I've been been breathing a bit faster.

D: You have any muscle aches or anything like that?

P: Ah no, not really.

D: OK, and give any other symptoms like chest pain, runny nose, sore throat, anything like that?

P: Uh, no. Just been really tired these last couple of days and I've just felt like sleeping all day. Haven't felt like eating either, my appetite has been really poor.

D: OK, uhm. And other than that, have you experienced any kind of headaches, nausea or vomiting? 

P: No, I haven't.

D: OK, any fevers or, you said you have had some chills, right?

P: I have yeah.

D: OK. And then a fever too. Kind of a sensation of your heart racing at all?

P: Ah, yeah, right. It doesn't feel like it's well, it does feel like it's beating a bit faster than usual, just not feeling too well.

D: Yeah, so yeah, we'll do a physical examination and get all your vital signs as well right after. Any, so you said you haven't been able to eat, ave you noticed any significant weight changes recently?

P: No, my weight's been about the same.

D: OK, any exposure to any dusts or animals, fumes, anything that might have triggered some of these symptoms?

P: No, I don't think so. My husband and I, we moved into a new kind of apartment here and it, it's brand new.

D: OK, any kind of loss of sense of taste or smell?

P: No, that's been normal.

D: OK, any exposure or any travel outside of the country at all.

P: No, nothing like that.

D: OK, so just mainly the coughing with the rusty material as well as just the shortness of breath. Umm, and do you get any pain at all in your chest when you breathe in or out?

P: No, I haven't had any, had anything like that.

D: OK, any past medical conditions that I should know of?

P: Yeah, I, umm, I had a stroke like that like six years ago. And I have type 2 diabetes. As well as GERD.

D: OK, and uh, yeah, I'm sorry you had you had a stroke six years ago or how are you after that? Were there any kind of, like did, after rehabilitation, do you have any symptoms still going on at all?

P: Yeah my, my left hand, still, still it gives me some some problems. I get uh, uh, Botulinum toxin injections for, for the tightness in my hand.

D: OK, OK, and are you taking any other medications at all?

P: Yeah, I use metformin. Empagliflozin or an SGLT2, insulin and uh, and aspirin, I think. 

D: OK, and any over the counter medications?

P: Yeah, I take a multivitamin and in vitamin D.

D: OK. Any allergies to any medications at all?

P: No. 

D: OK, any environmental allergies?

P: No. 

D: OK, any ill contacts at all? 

P: No, no. 

D: Any recent or prior hospitalizations?

P: No, the last time I was in the hospital was I was for rehab after my stroke.

D: OK and so, but after that, no other hospitalizations or surgeries?

P: No.

D: OK, any surgeries in the past? 

P: Yeah, well I did have a C-section for my son but that was many years ago now and everything for that was, was OK. Yeah.

D: OK. Any family history of any lung or heart conditions? Any cancers?

P: Uhm, yeah, my dad had had a heart attack actually, but he was in his 80s when that, when that happened.

D: OK, uhm and currently right now, are you working at all?

P: No, I'm retired. I used to be a teacher for Grade 3, uhm, but yeah, but since retired and my husband and I just moved into a smaller apartment to make it a bit easier on us. It was a lot trying to look after the house.

D: OK, well congratulations on your new home. Are you at all, you or your husband requiring any kind of supports outside of the home at all?

P: No, between us two we managed to get the shopping done, the cooking and and all the cleaning, and that sort of thing. I use a walker to get around when we're going longer distances.

D: OK. And currently right now, do you smoke at all?

P: Uh, yes I, I spoke about half a pack per day or maybe even less.

D: OK, and how, how long have you have smoked for?

P: Since I was 15 maybe?

D: OK. 

P: So yeah for like 45 years. 

D: And have you, at all been diagnosed with COPD or anything like that?

P: No, I was tested actually, uh, a couple of years ago and that the results were normal.

D: OK. Alright, and have you thought of quitting at all? I know you've been smoking like for a very long time, but have you at all tried to quit before?

P: Like I've considered it, but I I just don't think it, it'll be possible at this time.

D: OK, well if you at all are wanting any information or want to talk about quitting at all, um, we can provide more resources. Do you besides smoking, do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana?

P: No.

D: No. Any alcohol at all?

P: No.

D: OK. Yeah, so those are some of the questions I had a, I will be doing a physical examination with your shortness of breath. I just want to get a good listen to your lungs and take all your vitals as well. However, yeah so after that since you're having some symptoms of what might be a pneumonia, it can be a bacterial infection, a viral infection, we will have to get some blood work done as well as a chest x-ray. And right now, with the pandemic going on, we will also do Covid swab test for you as well, just in case. Does that sound good?

P: Yeah, that makes sense, thank you.

D: Alright and, if if you're while you're here, if your shortness of breath gets any worse at all, just let us know and we'll help you out.

P: OK, thank you, will do.

P: Uh for the last seven years.

D: Seven years, OK.",530.3511875,us_medical,"So I understand you removed a tick from your leg earlier today? Yes, I did. It was behind my left knee, kind of in the joint behind where it bends. It was stuck pretty good. It's still kind of red and tender there. I noticed it because the back of my knee was starting to feel a bit sore. Not the joint itself, but just kind of the skin, the whole area back there. And I found this tick I brought in with me, if you wanted to have a look at it. It's in like this little plastic container. And I don't really know when I got it. I was hiking on Friday and then Saturday I was out in my garden. I hope they're not around my house. I hope that it was from hiking and not gardening, but I did spend a lot of time outside on Saturday as well. Okay, so it sounds like it's been a little bit of time since you were last outdoors to when you first noticed it. Yeah. Okay. So when you picked off the tick, obviously you have it for me. Is it quite swollen or engorged? It's not too bad. I have actually had a tick in the past. And this is a long time ago, maybe like 10 years. And I actually had that kind of target rash thing that they talk about. And at that time, I remember I had to take antibiotics for a bit. Well, this one didn't look like that. It was more like a sore in one spot. I don't think it was as bad as that time and the tick that time. And the tick that time was quite swollen. This one was maybe a little bit but not as much. Okay. So just in terms of the tick's size, it doesn't look like it's been feeding for too long. So when ticks are feeding, they tend to engorge, they tend to swell up. So this looks more like a tiny little bug or does it kind of look like a little grape, almost like it's been swollen with blood? No, this one is pretty small. Okay. And I should mention that you had a tick bite in the past. The big concern for us is a disease called Lyme disease, which is spread by bacteria. But in fact, only one type of tick predominantly is a transmission, transmittal agent for it. That's called a deer tick. And its coloration is got a little bit of a brown butt and some black legs. Does it look like Have you checked your body for any other possible bites? No, I looked around and I looked at my husband too because we were just a little bit, you know, gave us a little bit of a scare. But no, there's been nothing else. Okay, good. Any other family members you think might have been exposed? No, it was just me and my husband. Okay, and what geographic area were you in when you were hiking? We were in Strathroy along the creek. Okay, so I can do, if I remember, there's a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario. And we can see exactly how that lines up to see if we should be a little bit concerned or not. Looks like Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point, so I think that we will be moving forward with antibiotics. But of course, I'll be talking to the physician who will be having a look at you as well. So it sounds like you haven't been having too much symptoms aside from you noticed this tick, the skin around it is fairly sore, and you've had this in the past, but you were treated with antibiotics in the past and since then you haven't had too many health problems after that? No, no, I've been pretty healthy. Okay, and just about your health right now, is there anything that you see the family physician or a doctor for in general regarding your health? Just for my cholesterol. Okay, are you taking any medications for that? Yeah, I take a statin. Can't remember which one. Okay, got it. And do you have any allergies? No, so no drug allergies? No. Okay, now we've already talked about other exposures, so it doesn't sound like anyone else in your family or any pets are around, so it's unlikely that you have ticks coming in. And he said he might have gotten this from gardening, but you're hoping that your area doesn't have ticks. Maybe just take a look. Ticks like to live on long grass, kind of on the intersection between woods and fields, to see if there's any hovering around. They kind of make a waving motion with their legs and sometimes you just spot them. You might want to get some insecticide out there. But it sounds like this is fairly recent.

P: Uhm, no, I, no that was everything I think. The only I I guess other thing that that I forgot to mention is that just he doesn't really like his appetite's been a little bit lower couple of days as well. But uh, he hasn't had any, like nausea or vomiting though.

D: OK, OK, yeah, that's good to know. Uhm, so because some of his symptoms overlap with those of Covid, we will do a swab on him and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results and he should isolate for 14 days because of those symptoms. And it doesn't, it sounds more in keeping with the picture of community acquired pneumonia, so for that we will get a chest x-ray, we'll check his oxygen and his temperature and if the chest x-ray shows consolidation umm, or some sort of infiltrate, it is likely that he has pneumonia. So, we will start by giving him some amoxicillin populate or cefuroxime for five days, and just keep monitoring his symptoms. They should resolve in about 5 days when the course of antibiotics is complete. If his condition gets worse like he's getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, just take him to the ER. And if symptoms don't resolve in five to seven days, we can do further work up or things like fungal infections or TB, or things like that. How does that sound?

P: That sounds great. Thank you.

D: OK, yeah, no problem.",642.1676875,us_medical,"What brings you here today? I'm here because my left hand kind of just like at the base of my thumb has been hurting for the past two days and it seems to be getting worse. And I'm left-handed so it's really hard for me to write or do anything or I have to like clench or grip things. Okay, and how long has this been going on for? So for the past two days but it got bad yesterday. Okay, and have you had any... If you were to describe the pain, where is it located exactly? It's just at the base of my thumb. You know where the fleshy part of your hand is. Okay, yeah. So just over there. Okay, and what kind of pain is it? Is it sharp or is it aching? At baseline it's an achy pain but if I try to move it or try to write or use a computer or anything like that it can become sharp. And on a scale of 0 to 10, 10 being the worst pain you felt in your life, how much would you rate it? I'd say like a 6. Okay, and does this pain move anywhere else in your hand or does it stay where you described? It just stays there. Okay, and what kind of motions cause the most pain? I'd say like, you know, trying to touch my pinky with my thumb. That hurts. Just like trying to rotate it hurts. Okay, and have you tried anything for the pain that has helped? No, I haven't really tried too much. I've just I just tried not to use it as much. Okay, and has this ever like, have you had any injuries to this hand, any trauma either recently or in the past? No, no, nothing like that. Okay. And is there any, do you do any kind of repetitive work that requires gripping or lifting with that hand, anything repetitive?

Okay, so are you left-handed? Yes. Okay, all right. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past? No, so you're healthy? Yes. Do you take any medications on a regular basis?

D: Okay, alright, so those are all the questions I had for you. We'll do like a full physical examination, take a look at your knee, um, and most likely, what this sounds like, is something called septic arthritis. It's uh, it's when there's like an infection that um, can go into your joints and uh, it is a pretty serious issue that we need to um, assess and treat as soon as possible. So the first thing that we will um, need to do, we'll need to do some blood work just to get some inflammation markers and just your uh, CBC, and see if you have um, an infection. However, we'll also need to do a joint aspiration of your of your um, go your knee, and we'll be taking some fluid within your joint called the synovial fluid and assess for um, we'll send in for um, culture, and look for like these crystals, and count. And then based on that, we'll understand um, the infection you have and what kind of infection you have. We will start you on antibiotics right away um, today, and so you will be um, here for a while until we get all those results back. And you may also require um, an admission today as well.

D: Okay. Okay, um, so yeah, we'll take a temperature of your uh, fever, and, so are you able to flex or extend your knee at all, or is it very painful?

P: It's really painful. I uh, the movement's really limited.

D: Okay, and has the pain been constant since it started a few hours ago.

P: Yeah, it's gotten uh, like it's, it's gotten slightly worse.

D: Okay, I see. Okay, um, any skin changes or rashes anywhere on your body?

P: No, it's just the red knee.

D: Okay. Um, any changes in your weight or appetite?

D: Okay, any weakness um, in your extremities?

P: No, no weakness.

D: Okay, um, do you have any past medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with? Any diabetes? High blood pressure?

P: Uh, I've been told my, my blood sugar has been like, it hasn't been controlled, so yeah, I think I have diabetes. Um, uh, but that's, that's it.

D: Okay, um, do you take anything for medicate, medication for your diabetes?

P: Uh, yeah, I, I take metformin and um, and uh, yeah, that, that's all I've been taking, but, I mean, it's really hard for me to uh, like get my medication sometimes and so um, I don't always take it. 

D: Okay, I see. Um, and do you have any allergies to any medications? 

P: Uh, not that I, not that I can think of. And, so something that I forgot to mention is uh, like I've had hepatitis in the past as well um, and uh, yeah. 

D: And do you know hepatitis you've had? 

P: Um, I've had, it was uh, hepatitis C and uh, I was, um, treated, I was treated for it. 

D: Okay. Okay, and how long ago was that?

P: That was about uh, two years ago.

D: Okay, and uh, did they tell you like how it may have been transmitted at all? Was it, uh, sexually? Um, was it through um, use of IV drug use? And did they tell you what the likely cause was?

P; Yeah, the, the likely cause was um, I was told it was through IV uh, drug use. I've been using now for uh, for about 10 years.

D: Okay, and have you um, and what do you usually use? 

P: Uh, well like, any, anything that I, that I can usually. But I, I guess like um, various types of opioids are kind of the, the, the main thing that I'll, that I'll use.

D: Okay, and have you um, injected uh, drugs recently at all?

P: Uh, yeah I, about uh, about two days ago was the last time.

D: Okay, okay. And um, do you use any other uh, drugs? Any recreational drugs like marijuana or any, do you inject any other drugs at all?

P: Yeah, I'll smoke, uh, smoke marijuana as well and um, like, I'll sometimes like, I'll take uh, pills too like dilaudid is um, is something that I'll, I'll get my hands on, but it can be expensive so, um, just, just whatever is available.

D: Okay. Um, have you had uh, when was the last time you had cellulitis?

P: Uh, he last time was about six months ago.

D: Okay, and were you admitted at all, or were you treated as an outpatient?

P: Uh, I was treated as an outpatient for that, and it did clear up. It wasn't the first time that I've, I've had cellulitis and, and um, yeah, so it was treated.

D: Okay, have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?

P: Um no, I haven't.

D: Okay. Uh, any family history of any conditions um, musculoskeletal or rheumatologic conditions? Uh, any rheumatoid arthritis, anything like that? 

P: Uh, I don't think so.

D: Okay. And currently, right now, um, what is your living situation like?

P: Uh, so um, I just live with uh, two of my, um, or actually sorry no, I live with my uh, with my parents and uh, yeah, so it's just both my parents.

D: Okay. And, um, do you currently work?

P: Uh, I was working until like, I um, yeah about uh, about 15 years ago and now I, like I got injured on the, uh, um at work and I've had like chronic back pain and I don't know, I think that's kind of how this partly all, all started. So I've been at home receiving uh, I'm on disability.

D: Okay. And do you smoke cigarettes?

P: Uh, I do, yeah I, I, I smoke um, about half a pack uh, to a pack a day.

D: Okay, and how long have you been smoking for?

P: Uh, so this has been, uh, about 20 years.

D: 20 years, okay. And do you drink alcohol? 

P: Um, sometimes yeah. I'll, I'll have uh, just a few beers, maybe a few beers a week. 

D: Okay, and yeah, we were just talking about some of uh, like the movement, but you're saying you have pain with any kind of movement at all, right?

P: Yeah, it, it's really painful, I just, I try not to move it at all. 

D: And it's very red and swollen and warm as well?

P: Yeah, all of those. 

D: Any symptoms at all in your hips or ankle?

P: No, those feel fine. I can move my hip and ankle okay, and no pain.

D: Okay, alright, so those are all the questions I had for you. We'll do like a full physical examination, take a look at your knee, um, and most likely, what this sounds like, is something called septic arthritis. It's uh, it's when there's like an infection that um, can go into your joints and uh, it is a pretty serious issue that we need to um, assess and treat as soon as possible. So the first thing that we will um, need to do, we'll need to do some blood work just to get some inflammation markers and just your uh, CBC, and see if you have um, an infection. However, we'll also need to do a joint aspiration of your of your um, go your knee, and we'll be taking some fluid within your joint called the synovial fluid and assess for um, we'll send in for um, culture, and look for like these crystals, and count. And then based on that, we'll understand um, the infection you have and what kind of infection you have. We will start you on antibiotics right away um, today, and so you will be um, here for a while until we get all those results back. And you may also require um, an admission today as well.

P: Okay, uh, thank you. Yeah, that, that sounds good.

D: Alright, yeah, so yeah, we'll get all that done for you shortly, and uh, we'll go from there. 

P: Right, thank you.

D: And um, we might also need an x-ray, so just sit tight. We'll, we'll come call you.

P: Okay, thank you.

D: Alright, you're welcome.","D: What brings you here today? 

P: I've had this like, pain in my knee. It started within the last few hours and my knee's swollen, it's painful. Um, I can barely move it.

D: Okay, were you uh, did you injure yourself at all before the last few hours or anything? Any trauma to um, is it the right knee or the left knee?

P: It's the left knee, an no, no trauma uh, or anything like that. I've never hurt this knee before in my life.

D: Okay, and has this ever happened to you before?

P: Uh. Um, no, nothing in my joints. I've had other infections before, like in my skin, um, like cellulitis, but I, I've never had a knee, knee problem like this before.

D: Okay, I see. And have you ever had cellulitis in that area?

P: Uh, I, I had it over, kind of my, uh, like over my foot before. 

D: Okay, and um, where would you describe the pain is? Is it like on the kneecap, is it above the kneecap, below? Where would you describe it?

P: I would say it's like my whole knee, it's like uh, I don't know, it looks like it's going to explode.

D: Okay, is it like um, so, it's swollen, is it red and warm?

P: It is, yeah, it's really red.

D: Okay 

P: And warm as well. 

D: Okay, and how would you describe the pain? Um, is it like a sharp, stabbing pain, or is it an aching pain?

P: It's a, a stabbing pain.

D: Okay, and uh, are you mainly having the pain with movement of your knee, or um, when you're pressing on it?

P: Uh, I would say both, I can't um, I can't really move it, it'll give me pain. And even pressing on it, it's, it's quite painful.

D: Okay. And on a scale of uh, 1 to 10, sorry 0 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you've felt in your life, how much would you rate this pain?

P: Uh, it's a 9.

D: A 9, okay. Um, so it just started a few hours ago. Is there anything that makes the pain better or worse?

P: Um, I mean just trying to stay as still as possible is all I've been been doing so far, uh because, um, like any type of movement is really bad.

D: Okay, and are you able to weight bear, are you able to stand and walk by yourself?

P: Uh, I, I was pretty much like hopping on one leg to, to get in here and as soon as I could, I got in a wheelchair, just because it uh, hurts so bad. 

D: Okay, and um, do you have any pain or symptoms in any other joints or muscles of your body?

P: No, just, it's just my left knee.

D: Just your left knee, okay. Um, do you have any other symptoms like fevers, chills, nausea or vomiting?

P: Um, I have felt uh, uh feverish, yeah. But then, yeah, I, I felt feverish and um, but I haven't had any chills, though.

D: Okay, when were you feeling fevers?

P: Uh, just like, today, it's kind of, yeah, it started within the last day.

D: Okay, and um, did you get a chance to measure your temperature at all? If not, we can do that here. 

P: Um no, no, I didn't get to uh, I, I didn't check it.

D: Okay, and have you been sick at all recently, either with um, any cold-like symptoms uh, or any GI symptoms, like diarrhea, um, constipation, anything like that?

P: Uh, no, I haven't had any, anything like that.

D: Okay, and have you recently had any um, sexually transmitted diseases, or exposures to uh, ticks or lyme disease? 

P: Uh, I don't think so. I've been just, in well, in the city. I haven't traveled anywhere, and I uh, I haven't been sexually active for, for quite a while now, so. 

D: Okay, okay. Uh, have you recently, at all, had um, any procedures done on your knee, like any surgeries or any joint like um, injections or aspirations?

D: OK, and have you had any, uh if you were to describe the pain, where is it located exactly?

P: It's just at the base of my thumb. Uh you know where the fleshy part of your hand is?

D: OK yeah yeah.

P: Yeah, so just just over there.

D: OK, and what kind of pain is it? Is it sharp or is it aching?

P: Uhm, it's it's like a um, at baseline it's an achy pain, but if I try to move it or um try to write or you know, use a computer or anything like that, it becomes sharp. 

D: OK, Um and on a scale of uh zero to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've felt in your life, how much would you rate it?

P: I'd say like a 6.

D: OK, and does this pain move anywhere else in your hand, or does it just stay where you described?

P: Um it just stays there. 

D: OK, and what kind of motions uh cause the most pain?

P: I'd say like um you know, trying to touch my pinky with my thumb, that that hurts. Um just like trying to rotate it hurts.

D: OK, um have you tried anything for the pain that has helped? 

P: Uhm, no, I haven't really tried too much. I've just I just tried not to use it as much.

D: I see. OK. And um, has this ever like, have you ever had any injuries to this hand? Any trauma either recently or in the past?

P: No, no, nothing like that.

D: OK. Alright, and is there any, do you do any kind of repetitive work that requires gripping or lifting um with that hand, anything repetitive?

P: So I do a lot of work at the computer. And um I guess I tend to type a lot with my left hand, so maybe that.

D: OK.

P: And sorry I also take lots of notes, like handwritten notes with my left hand.

D: OK, so are you left handed? 

P: Yes.

D: OK. Alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?

P: No. 

D: No, so you're healthy?

P: Yes.

D: Um do you take any medications on a regular basis? 

P: Uh no, no.

D: No, OK. Any allergies to any medications?

P: Um no allergies.

D: OK, um any previous surgeries or hospitalizations?

P: No.

D: No, any family history of any medical conditions, whether it's musculoskeletal, rheumatological, any conditions?

P: Uh no, nothing like that.

D: OK, um any cancers in the family?

P: Um I know there's, yeah there's a lot of cancer in the family. There's colon cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer. 

D: OK. And are they first degree relatives who had those cancers?

P: Uh no first degree relatives, just like aunts and uncles. 

D: OK. Uh alright, and currently are you working right now or have you had any time off work or any modified duties?

P: Um so I'm still working online, I've just um haven't been taking notes by hand anymore.

D: I see, and does that help though? 

P: Uh yeah it it has helped a little bit because I'm not moving my hand as much so it helps with the pain. 

D: OK. Have you taken any uh Tylenol, Advil, anything for the pain? 

P: No, I haven't.

D: OK. Alright. And currently right now, what is your living situation like?

P: Uh I live in an apartment by myself.

D: OK, and um, do you currently uh smoke cigarettes? 

P: Um I smoke, I used to smoke like five years ago, and I only did that for like a year or two, um and it wasn't very much. But I don't smoke anymore.

D: OK, that's good. Um any alcohol?

P: Um I'll have like a beer on the weekend.

D: OK. Any recreational drugs like marijuana?

P: Um I will take an edible like once a month.

D: OK. Um and yeah, those were just some of the questions I had um and we're just going to do a few things for examining, examining uh that area. So are you able to make a fist?

P: Um I can, but it hurts.

D: OK, it hurts in that location that you mentioned?

P: Yes. 

D: How about um if you make a fist without your thumb, does it still hurt or is it just when you are moving the thumb?

P: It's just when I'm moving the thumb.

D: OK. And if you were able to, are you able to uh rotate your wrist?

P: Uh yes, I can rotate my wrist.

D: Does that hurt at all? 

P: No.

D: OK, um now I just want you to do this one test. It's called a Finkelstein test. OK so I want you to flex your thumb, press it up down against your palm.

P: OK. 

D: And then hold your hand, sorry.

P: No, go ahead.

D: Yeah, and then after you do that, um, bring your fingers above your thumb, so just cover your thumb.

P: OK.

D: Kind of like a fist, but your thumb is on the inside of your fingers.

P: OK.

D: And then bring your uh arm out.

P: OK. 

D: And with your other hand, can you, from above push your wrist downwards? So your uh pinky finger is uh pointing to the pointing to the ground.

P: OK, yep.

D: Yeah, and did that hurt at all? Like when you, so this is just called ulnar deviation or your um of your wrist. Does that hurt at all?

P: Yes, that is very painful.

D: That's very painful, OK. Alright, um and then you're also having pain with gripping and, OK, so those are kind of all the things I wanted to ask. Uh it seems that you may be having something called De Quervain's tenosynovitis. Um it's caused by some repetitive motions, uh it can be due to gripping. Sometimes it happens to new mothers who are lifting their children as well as daycare workers. It can also happen in other work environments, and so what we will first just need to do um is mainly to rule out something like osteoarthritis. You are fairly young um but if there was ever an injury in the past, it you can have early osteoarthritis in the area. So we just want to get an X-Ray. And other than that, the way we kind of deal with this issue is usually conservatively and with a splint. 

P: OK. 

D: And a sling for your thumb that uh helps relieve some of these symptoms, uh restricts some of your movements, reduces some of the swelling, and if it does get really bad and it's affecting your work and conservative management with pain and the splint don't work, and with physiotherapy, we do uh offer injecting corticosteroids into just right like in the area that you mentioned, right below the thumb.

P: OK. 

D: Um and that often has some effect as well. Um but at first, yeah, let's just do some conservative management and see if that helps. It's only been a few days, so hopefully um what we try first helps. And then we can go on from there.

P: OK yeah, that sounds great. Thank you. 

D: Welcome, take care.

P: You too.",620.6140625,us_medical,"What brings you in today? Yeah, I've had shortness of breath and even at rest, I feel like it's difficult to breathe. When I take a deep breath, I get a chest pain. When did this start? It started yesterday. How bad is your shortness of breath? I feel like I'm okay in terms of being able to breathe, but if I exert myself at all, I can't. It's been getting worse. Have you gotten worse since yesterday? It's mostly been the same, or actually, sorry, it's gotten a little bit worse. At first, it was more with exertion and now it's at rest as well. Are you able to talk in full sentences or do you need to take a deep breath? I can talk in full sentences. Is the chest pain only when you're taking a deep breath or are there other times as well? Pretty much, yeah. Only when I'm taking a deep breath. And the chest pain, does it only occur when you're taking a deep breath or are there other times as well? I mean, maybe that's why I can't take a deep breath, so it's making the breathing more difficult, making me feel more short of breath. Any other symptoms that you've had? A fever? Or a headache? No, nothing like that. Any cough? Yeah, I've had a cough as well over the same time period. Is it a dry cough or are you bringing up something? It's dry. I haven't brought up any sputum or any blood. Any other flu-like symptoms? Runniness, nose, stuffy nose, sore throat, anything like that? No, just the shortness of breath and chest pain. Okay. And have you, I guess, more general questions about other potential symptoms? Do you feel like your heart is racing or do you have any belly pain or changes in your bowel movements? No, belly pain or changes to bowel movements, but I do feel like my heart is beating really fast. Yeah. Okay. You said that this started yesterday. Were you like completely fine the day before? I was, yeah. Anything that's happened recently that's different or new? Well, about two weeks ago, I had a hysterectomy because I had abnormal bleeding. So yeah, I had surgery two weeks ago. What have you been doing these past two weeks in terms of physical activity? Have you been moving around or no? It's certainly been less. I've been moving a little bit, but I've had a lot Okay. Any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with? Um, yeah. I have a high BMI, type 2 diabetes, and anxiety. Do you have any bleeding disorders? Um, no, I don't. Do you take any medications? Um, yeah. So, insulin, Wellbutrin, and, um, that's it. Do you have any allergies? No, I don't. Do you live alone? No, I live with my husband and our two sons. Do you have any wants that have come in to help you out over the past two weeks? Are you getting any outside help from nurses, etc.? Or are your family members being helpful? Yeah, it's mostly the family members. My husband's been working from home and the kids have been helpful as well. They're 10 and 12, so they're able to do some things on their own. So yeah, they've been helpful. Okay. Do you smoke at all? Um, I do, yes. I smoke about a half pack per day. For how long? Um, yeah, I mean, I started after the kids were born, actually. So, like 10 years ago. Okay. Have you tried cutting it down at all? Yeah, I've kind of gone through um, spurts of quitting and restarting. So, yeah, I've tried before. Okay. And what about marijuana or recreational drugs? Um, no, don't use anything like that. And alcohol? Yeah, I have some wine on the weekends, but maybe that's like a glass or two. Okay. Okay. And do you have any medical conditions that run in the family? Um, just, um, yeah. My father actually had a stroke when he was 68. And that's it. Okay. You haven't ever had one, have you? No, I haven't had anything like that. Okay. So, I guess, in terms of smoking, you said that you've tried to quit a couple of times in the past. Do you intend on trying again? I know it can be very hard to quit smoking. I've lost a few pounds, but not enough. Definitely want to keep going. Okay, good. As long as you feel that what you're currently doing is helping you and is helping you reduce weight, that's great. But also, I'm here for you if you need more education or guidance on that. So, given what you've told me so far, it sounds like you might have developed a clot in your leg somewhere simply because you had a surgery and you were not moving around very much, sometimes that causes the blood to kind of not move around your body as much as it usually does and kind of stays in one place and gets turned into a clot and that can sometimes get dislodged and settle into your lungs and that can make it difficult for you to breathe. So, we'll do some tests. That's what my understanding is given what you've told me so far, but we do have to confirm it using a test. Also, the fact that you smoke and your weight and your BMI is high increases your risk of developing a clot. So, I would definitely strongly recommend that you continue to try to reduce both and try to quit smoking. And so, we'll do an ultrasound of your leg and we'll do a scan of your chest and see what's going on and then decide if we need to give you any medications, like any blood thinning medications."," what brings you in here today?

P: Uh yes, I can rotate my wrist.

D: Does that hurt at all? 

P: No.

D: OK, um now I just want you to do this one test. It's called a Finkelstein test. OK so I want you to flex your thumb, press it up down against your palm.

P: OK. 

D: And then hold your hand, sorry.

P: No, go ahead.

D: Yeah, and then after you do that, um, bring your fingers above your thumb, so just cover your thumb.

P: OK.

D: Kind of like a fist, but your thumb is on the inside of your fingers.

P: OK.

D: And then bring your uh arm out.

P: OK. 

D: And with your other hand, can you, from above push your wrist downwards? So your uh pinky finger is uh pointing to the pointing to the ground.

P: OK, yep.

D: Yeah, and did that hurt at all? Like when you, so this is just called ulnar deviation or your um of your wrist. Does that hurt at all?

P: Yes, that is very painful.

D: That's very painful, OK. Alright, um and then you're also having pain with gripping and, OK, so those are kind of all the things I wanted to ask. Uh it seems that you may be having something called De Quervain's tenosynovitis. Um it's caused by some repetitive motions, uh it can be due to gripping. Sometimes it happens to new mothers who are lifting their children as well as daycare workers. It can also happen in other work environments, and so what we will first just need to do um is mainly to rule out something like osteoarthritis. You are fairly young um but if there was ever an injury in the past, it you can have early osteoarthritis in the area. So we just want to get an X-Ray. And other than that, the way we kind of deal with this issue is usually conservatively and with a splint. 

P: OK. 

D: And a sling for your thumb that uh helps relieve some of these symptoms, uh restricts some of your movements, reduces some of the swelling, and if it does get really bad and it's affecting your work and conservative management with pain and the splint don't work, and with physiotherapy, we do uh offer injecting corticosteroids into just right like in the area that you mentioned, right below the thumb.

P: OK. 

D: Um and that often has some effect as well. Um but at first, yeah, let's just do some conservative management and see if that helps. It's only been a few days, so hopefully um what we try first helps. And then we can go on from there.

P: OK yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.

RES0073,/home/kelechi/bio_ramp_asr/data/uk_datasets/Data/Audio Recordings/RES0073.mp3,"D: Would you mind by starting with what brought you in?

P: Yeah, so over the last week I've just been feeling some symptoms. It kind of first started with, like a runny nose. That was around like 5 days ago and then it turned into just a lot of congestion, like around my nose and like my throat. And now over the last two days I've been just feeling so much pressure around my nose and around my jaw so I've been getting a lot of pain there as well.

D: OK, is your nose still running?

P: Yeah, I'm still getting some discharge and I also feel like I'm getting some dripping at the back of my throat too, especially when I wake up.

D: OK, and could you describe the discharge? Is it clear, yellow, greenish?

P: Uh, it's fairly clear and sometimes, like a bit white, but like, it's not like green or yellow.

D: OK, uh, and have you felt that it's difficult to breathe in through either of your nostrils, like it's obstructed?

P: Yeah, so at night sometimes I have to like turn because one side of my nose gets difficult to breathe from and then it kind of balances out on the other side. So yeah, I do have some obstruction.

D: OK, and have you had any changes to your sense of smell?

P: Yeah, so just in the last three days when the congestion got really bad I started losing the ability to smell.

D: OK, have you had any changes to your sense of taste?

P: No, taste is fine. 

D: OK, and have you had any cough or sore throat?

P: Uh, no. No cough or sore throat.

D: OK, and the symptoms have gone on for five days. Have you had a period of time where you got better and then got sick again? 

P: I did kind of have a runny nose last week as well, so probably like 8 days ago but then the runny nose discontinued a little bit but really got worse 5 days ago, but all these other symptoms just happened in the last few days.

D: OK, and you have pain. Do you feel it in your jaw or do you feel it in the in the front of your nose?

P: Yes, I would say mainly over the cheeks. It can kind of go near the front of my teeth as well, so like I would say like mostly around the cheeks, jaws and up to the front of my teeth. 

D: OK, And do you grind your teeth at all at night? or have you had, TMJ issues before?

P: No nothing like that. I think it's not so much on and around my teeth, it's more so just to right below my nose, above my teeth and just around my cheeks.

D: OK, so no pain in your mouth or anything like that?

P: No, not inside my mouth.

D: OK, have you had any fevers or chills?

P: Uhm, I Don't think I've had a fever. I did feel some chills over the last few days, but just very brief episodes.

D: OK, and over the last few weeks have you had any weight loss? 

P: No.

D: OK, and you said you didn't have a cough or a sore throat, but have you had any wheezing?

P: No wheezing.

D: How about any shortness of breath?

P: Uh, not shortness of breath. Just sometimes when my nose gets like really congested, I just turn into like a mouth breather, but that's about it.

D: I see, OK, and have you had any chest pain?

P: No, no chest pain. 

D: Alright, and any lightheadedness or feeling dizzy?

P: No.

D: OK, have you had any nausea or vomiting?

P: Nope. 

D: Any abdominal pain? 

P: No.

D: Have you had any diarrhea?

P: Sorry, what was that?

D: Have you had any diarrhea?

P: No diarrhea. 

D: OK, and have you had any urinary problems?

P: Uh, no.

D: And have you had any rashes or skin changes?

P: No, not that I know.

D: OK, then how about any muscle aches or joint aches? 

P: Uh, no.

D: OK, and have you had any muscle weakness?

P: No.

D: And how has your energy been? Any fatigue?

P: Uhm, it's been mainly OK, just maybe sometimes difficult to get to sleep with all the all the congestion, but I don't think my energy has been affected too much, no.

D: OK, and, uh, sorry to go back to this, I don't think I asked. Did you notice any discharge from your eyes or any eye redness?

P: Not discharge, but yeah, maybe a little bit of redness.

D: OK, have your eyes been itchy?

P: Uhm Yeah, a little bit. I would say they have been a bit itchy.

D: OK, alright then, do you have any medical conditions that you see a physician for regularly? 

P: Uh, just uhm, its called dyslipidemia. 

D: OK, I see, and any medications you take for that?

P: Just like a Statin medication.

D: OK, do you take any other medications? over the counter? prescribed?

P: No, other than that I take multivitamins.

D: OK, and do you have any allergies to medications or like environmental allergies that might be getting worse?

P: Uh, no, not that I know.

D: OK, so you don't experience any symptoms like this when the seasons change?

P: I don't think so. I have had this happen to me, Uh, I would say like once before. It happened like two years ago. It was pretty similar. 

D: OK, uhm, and what was done at that time?

P: At that time it kind of just went away on it's own. It got better. I feel it's definitely worse this time. But at that time I didn't even go to the doctor, it kind of just went away.

D: OK, I see. Any recent hospitalizations?

P: No hospitalizations.

D: Any surgeries?

P: Nope. 

D: Alright, and could you tell me where abouts you're living currently and who you're living with?

P: Yeah, so I'm currently living in an apartment by myself, just outside of London.

D: OK, and anybody that you've been around who's had any symptoms?

P: Uh, no, not that I know of.

D: OK, so no sick Contacts. And have you traveled anywhere out of the city or province?

P: No, I've tried to stay home, besides going to work. I just work at the grocery store. Besides that, no, nowhere else.

D: OK, and any of your coworkers have any symptoms? Or any coworkers being off sick?

P: No, we're pretty careful right now with the pandemic.

D: I see, yeah, that's great. OK, and do you smoke cigarettes?

P: No, I quit just a couple of years ago.

D: Oh, that's great. It's not easy to quit, so that's awesome. And do you drink alcohol?

P: Just maybe like red wine a couple of times a week.

D: I see, OK, and do you use any recreational drugs? 

P: Uh, just, in a month, maybe once or twice, I smoke a joint.

D: OK, uh, and anybody in the family have any lung or heart conditions?

P: No, not that I know of.

D: Alright, and how about any cancer in the family?

P: Uh, no, no cancers.

D: OK, I think I that was everything I wanted to ask about today. Was there any other symptoms or anything else that you wanted to make sure I knew about today?

P: No,  I think that's all. I just didn't know if I needed any, like, medications or if I needed to get tested. I just wanted to make sure.

D: Yeah, so well, certainly check your temperature to see if you have a fever. And if you do and it's high enough, that will increase the chance that you have a bacterial sinusitis,  and if so, with some of your symptoms, including the discharge, obstruction, loss of smell, and facial pain, that all fits the picture for it and also you had a period where you felt a little bit better and then worse again. So that might require antibiotics, but we will check your temperature and go from there. 

P: Alright, sounds good, thank you so much.

And lung cancer, you mentioned any other cancers that run in the family? No. Okay. So that was all the questions I wanted to ask on history. Certainly, it sounds like you're bringing up some blood with the increased cough and with difficulties breathing. So we will get a chest x-ray and possibly a CT image of your chest as well to see if there's anything going on. And we might do some blood work as well to check a few things.

D: OK, so no pain in your mouth or anything like that?

P: No, not inside my mouth.

D: OK, have you had any fevers or chills?

P: No.

D: OK, and you said you didn't have a cough or a sore throat, but have you had any wheezing?

P: No.

D: And how has your energy been? Any fatigue?

P: Uhm, it's been mainly OK, just maybe sometimes difficult to get to sleep with all the all the congestion, but I don't think my energy has been affected too much, no.

D: OK, and, uh, sorry to go back to this, I don't think I asked. Did you notice any discharge from your eyes or any eye redness?

P: Not discharge, but yeah, maybe a little bit of redness.

D: OK, have your eyes been itchy?

P: Uhm Yeah, a little bit. I would say they have been a bit itchy.

D: OK, alright then, do you have any medical conditions that you see a physician for regularly? 

P: Uh, just uhm, its called dyslipidemia. 

D: OK, I see, and any medications you take for that?

P: Just like a Statin medication.

D: OK, do you take any other medications? over the counter? prescribed?

P: No, other than that I take multivitamins.

D: OK, and do you have any allergies to medications or like environmental allergies that might be getting worse?

P: Uh, no, not that I know.

D: OK, so you don't experience any symptoms like this when the seasons change?

P: I don't think so. I have had this happen to me, Uh, I would say like once before. It happened like two years ago. It was pretty similar. 

D: OK, uhm, and what was done at that time?

P: At that time it kind of just went away on it's own. It got better. I feel it's definitely worse this time. But at that time I didn't even go to the doctor, it kind of just went away.

D: OK, I see. Any recent hospitalizations?

P: No hospitalizations.

D: Any surgeries?

P: Nope. 

D: Alright, and could you tell me where abouts you're living currently and who you're living with?

P: Yeah, so I'm currently living in an apartment by myself, just outside of London.

D: OK, and anybody that you've been around who's had any symptoms?

P: Uh, no, not that I know of.

D: OK, so no sick Contacts. And have you traveled anywhere out of the city or province?

P: No, I've tried to stay home, besides going to work. I just work at the grocery store. Besides that, no, nowhere else.

D: OK, and any of your coworkers have any symptoms? Or any coworkers being off sick?

P: No, we're pretty careful right now with the pandemic.

D: I see, yeah, that's great. OK, and do you smoke cigarettes?

P: No, I quit just a couple of years ago.

D: Oh, that's great. It's not easy to quit, so that's awesome. And do you drink alcohol?

P: Uh, no, no cancers.

D: OK, I think I that was everything I wanted to ask about today. Was there any other symptoms or anything else that you wanted to make sure I knew about today?

P: No,  I think that's all. I just didn't know if I needed any, like, medications or if I needed to get tested. I just wanted to make sure.

D: Yeah, so well, certainly check your temperature to see if you have a fever. And if you do and it's high enough, that will increase the chance that you have a bacterial sinusitis,  and if so, with some of your symptoms, including the discharge, obstruction, loss of smell, and facial pain, that all fits the picture for it and also you had a period where you felt a little bit better and then worse again. So that might require antibiotics, but we will check your temperature and go from there. 

P: Alright, sounds good, thank you so much.

D: Thank you.","D: Would you mind by starting with what brought you in?

P: Yeah, so over the last week I've just been feeling some symptoms. It kind of first started with, like a runny nose. That was around like 5 days ago and then it turned into just a lot of congestion, like around my nose and like my throat. And now over the last two days I've been just feeling so much pressure around my nose and around my jaw so I've been getting a lot of pain there as well.

D: OK, is your nose still running?

P: Yeah, I'm still getting some discharge and I also feel like I'm getting some dripping at the back of my throat too, especially when I wake up.

D: OK, and could you describe the discharge? Is it clear, yellow, greenish?

P: Uh, it's fairly clear and sometimes, like a bit white, but like, it's not like green or yellow.

D: OK, uh, and have you felt that it's difficult to breathe in through either of your nostrils, like it's obstructed?

P: Yeah, so at night sometimes I have to like turn because one side of my nose gets difficult to breathe from and then it kind of balances out on the other side. So yeah, I do have some obstruction.

D: OK, and have you had any changes to your sense of smell?

P: Yeah, so just in the last three days when the congestion got really bad I started losing the ability to smell.

D: OK, have you had any changes to your sense of taste?

P: No, taste is fine. 

D: OK, and have you had any cough or sore throat?

P: Uh, no. No cough or sore throat.

D: OK, and the symptoms have gone on for five days. Have you had a period of time where you got better and then got sick again? 

P: I did kind of have a runny nose last week as well, so probably like 8 days ago but then the runny nose discontinued a little bit but really got worse 5 days ago, but all these other symptoms just happened in the last few days.

D: OK, and you have pain. Do you feel it in your jaw or do you feel it in the in the front of your nose?

P: Yes, I would say mainly over the cheeks. It can kind of go near the front of my teeth as well, so like I would say like mostly around the cheeks, jaws and up to the front of my teeth.

D: OK, and any muscle aches or or body pains?

P: No.

D: Have you had any rashes?

P: No.

D: OK, so the cough started 5 days ago, you had a sore throat, you've been feeling a bit more tired and haven't been able to taste your food for the last couple of days.

P: Yes. 

D: OK. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?

P: Um, no, I don't think so.

D: OK, nothing you see a physician regularly for?

P: No.

D: Alright, do you take any medications?

P: No.

D: Alright, do you know if you have any allergies to medications?

P: Umm, possibly penicillin.

D: OK, do you know what the reaction was?

P: I think I had a rash. 

D: OK. Are your immunizations up to date?

P: I think, yeah, I think so.

D: Excellent and any surgeries before? 

P: Umm, no. 

D: And have you been in the hospital for any reason?

P: Umm, no, no. 

D: OK. And are you in school now?

P: I'm in grade 6.

D: OK, cool, what's your favorite class?

P: I would say it's math.

D: Awesome and has there been anybody in your class who's been sick?

P: No, everything's virtual right now.

D: OK cool, so have you traveled anywhere?

P: Umm, no.

D: Alright, and who are you living with?

P: I live with two of my younger siblings and my mom and dad.

D: OK, and is there any physical or verbal abuse in the home?

P: No. 

D: OK, so you do feel safe in the home?

P: Yes yes. 

D: OK. And do you smoke cigarettes?

P: I don't. 

D: OK and I know some people in your age group might even start using other types of substances. Have you noticed anything like that, or have you used anything like that?

P: Umm, no.

D: OK. And so do you drink? do you drink alcohol?

P: I have had a sip of wine, but that's that's about it.

D: OK, great. And has anybody in your family had had similar symptoms?

P: No, I don't think so. 

D: OK, um and anybody in the family have asthma or lung conditions?

P: I think my aunt has asthma but I was I was checked for asthma when I was younger and it turns out I don't have it.

D: OK, and any diseases that run in the family like genetic or congenital?

P: I think Crohn's disease.

D: OK, and umm, who in the family has that?

P: My father. 

D: OK, so that was everything that I wanted to ask today, was there anything else you wanted to tell me?

P: No, that's it. What do you think I have?

D: Well, it is sounding like it could be most likely an infectious type of process going on with the possibility of having a fever with a cough and sore throat. So we'll do a physical exam and also some investigations which will include a covid test today. Because some of these symptoms do overlap, but it could be something like the common cold. I don't know the virus that's bringing this on but it's not necessarily covid. But because we're doing the test, it will require 14 days of self isolation. We'll get back to you with the results as quickly as we can.

P: OK, sounds great, thank you.",596.4788125,us_medical,"What brings you here today? So I'm here because my shoulder has been really painful for the past week. And any movement of that right shoulder causes a lot of pain. Okay. And how long have you been having this pain for? For the past week. Okay. And did you injure your shoulder at all recently? Any trauma to the area or anything like that? So about a couple months ago, I was due to work in construction. So I was moving around some heavy objects and, um, I guess the repetitive motions caused some sort of rotator cuff injury. But I got that treated and everything was fine for a couple months. But this pain just started a week ago. Okay. And where is this pain located exactly? It's just like in my shoulder, like at the joint between my upper arm and shoulder. Okay. And is it an aching pain or a sharp stabbing pain? So at rest, it seems to be like aching and stiff, but when I move my shoulder or when I try to move it, it causes more of a sharp pain. Sharp pain. Okay. And what kind of movements cause the sharp pain? Or is it just any movements? Any movements. Okay. Are there any movements that are worse in particular? No, it hurts. Okay. Are you having, is this pain moving to any other joints or any other part of your body? No. Okay. So just in the area that you described? Yes. Okay. And do you notice any kind of, just looking at your shoulder outside, any swelling, redness, any masses or deformities? No, I don't see anything like that. Okay. And is there anything that you've tried that has helped with your pain? I've tried some ibuprofen, some ice, it seems to help temporarily. Okay. And earlier when you had the rotator cuff injury, did you get physiotherapy? I did. But I didn't finish the full course. I just went for a week or so and then I had to go back to work. So I stopped doing that. I see. Yeah, so that's something definitely, and we'll need to consider going forward as well. Other than that, are you having any symptoms of any fevers or chills? No, nothing like that. Okay. And have you been sick recently at all or met with someone who was sick? No. Okay. Any weight loss or loss in appetite or anything like that? No, nothing like that. Okay Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past? I have, um, I have diabetes, but that's about it. Okay. Do you take any medications? I'm on metformin. Okay. Do you have any allergies to any medications? Um, no, no allergies to medications. Okay. Have you been hospitalized or had any surgeries in the past? No. No. Do you have any family history of musculoskeletal or rheumatologic conditions? No. Okay. Currently, right now, so you said you work as a construction worker, right? Yes. And are you off of work right now or have you been off of work due to your previous injury and pain or are you still working? I'm still working, but modified. So I am not lifting any heavy objects or anything like that. I'm just doing some like groundwork. Okay. That sounds good. And we might also need to, if you're doing any kind of over head work where you're raising your arms above your shoulders that might cause further problems as well. So we'll look into some of those modified duties as well. Okay. And what is your living situation like right now? Who do you live with? I live by myself right now. And do you live in a house or apartment? I live in an apartment. Okay. And in terms of your daily life, do you smoke at all? I don't smoke. I used to smoke before. Okay. And do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana or any other drugs? Um, no, no. How about smoking? Do you smoke cigarettes? Sorry, you said you quit. Do you drink alcohol? I drink like a glass of wine here and there. Okay. All right. Yeah. And those were some of the questions I had for you. In terms of a physical examination, when you press on the area that you describe, when you press around the area, does it hurt? I have to press pretty hard for it to hurt. Okay, but otherwise, it's not tender. No. Okay. And again, no swelling, redness, or anything like that. It's mainly just on the inside. Yeah. Okay. And any kind of movement hurts, right? There's no particular movement that, like, if you were trying to raise that shoulder by itself, if you were to just move it with the other arm, does it hurt? The other arm doesn't hurt at all. Or like, if you were to use your left arm to x-rays from before. If we need to, we can also get an ultrasound. We can't really tell from the x-rays. Then from there, we can get some blood work as well, just your normal blood work as well as inflammation markers. Then from there, we'll need to really discuss some management strategies. So you've already tried some physiotherapy, but we need to make sure that it's consistent because this is something that has a high recurrence rate and we will definitely need to finish the full course of physiotherapy, whatever it may be. Because if physiotherapy doesn't work, we may have to consider other options like cortico steroid injections right into your shoulder. But yeah, so first we'll just try some conservative methods like physiotherapy, pain management, and then go from there. How does that sound?"," Would you mind starting with telling me what brought you in? Sure. I have had this cough for the past five days, and it doesn't seem to be getting any better. So I'm just here to ask you what it possibly could be.

D: OK, have you done anything that's made the pain worse since last night?

P: No I just tried to just rest and I tried to use some ice, but nothing. Nothing's been working and I kind of also have like this. It it's weird, it's just like this mass right where my biceps is. It kind of just makes my biceps look really big.

D: OK, alright, well I skip look at that during the physical exam component thank you and so like are you seeing swell is there like swelling there is as well or is is that part painful?

P: No, I don't think so. 

D: OK, and have you had any muscle weakness?

P: Just just in the in that area, I can't really like. I can't really flex an really move my upper upper arm in my elbow. 

D: OK. Do you have any pains in any other joints? 

P: Um no that's it's only my right upper arm.

D: OK. Um. And. Have you had any confusion or memory loss?

P: No. OK. And in the past, have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?

P: Uhm no I've been pretty healthy, um I they think I do have like pre diabetes but I'm not on any medication.

D: OK, and have you had any issues with your shoulder before like like a subacromial like impingement syndrome or like a rotator cuff pains or problems in the past?

P: A few years ago I did have some pain um with like some, they they told me not to do like overhead work like just things that require like with Physio I need to do some strengthening as well and it was it wasn't the same same shoulder.

D: OK. And do you take any medications regularly?

P: Uh, no.

D: OK, and do you have any allergies?

P: No.

D: Have you had any hospitalizations or prior surgeries? 

P: I had my tonsils removed when I was probably like 10 or something, but that's about it.

D: OK, and for the shoulder in the past did you have any imaging done like an ultrasound or or MRI maybe to look at the structures?

P: No, it was just a it kind of went away. I just did some physio they didn't really do any imaging.

D: I see OK. And can you tell me a little about your living situation right now, like you're living with and where?

P: Yeah so I'm living with my wife and um daughter and I'm living just in a condominium in the city.

D: OK, and are you working right now?

P: Yeah, so I'm an accountant. I'm working from home, so it's not that bad, but I I might just take a few days off depending on what I have to do with this injury.

D: OK, and um do you and hobby wise you mentioned like weight lifting, are you an active person like bodybuilding and that sort of thing regularly? 

P: I I just actually probably started this past year. I used to. I used to workout a lot. In University and in my early 30s but then I stopped and this year I've kind of gone back into it.

D: OK, well it's good that you're staying active. And um do you smoke cigarettes?

P: No, I uh, probably tried a couple times and. High School and University, but just it was never my thing.

D: OK, and how about cannabis, like smoking marijuana or using any of those types of products?

P: No, I I try to stay away from any drugs.

D: OK, uh, including recreational drugs?

P: Yeah.

D: OK and. Uh, are there any musculoskeletal or neurological problems that that run in the family?

P: Not that I know of, no.

D: OK, now how about any autoimmune diseases?

P: Uh, no, I don't think so.

D: OK, so next I just wanted to ask you to have a look at the at the arm. Compared to the other side, are you noticing any swelling, redness, or?

P: Yeah, any swelling or redness, I do see some just like kind of like in the middle of this area, some redness kind of looks like some bruising in in that in that region. Uhm, I also feel like when I like try to flex my biceps kind of have moved upwards.

D: OK, is this the mass or lump that I you were mentioning earlier that you kinda can notice in the in your right arm? 

P: Yeah yeah.

D: OK, is there any temperature change, like does it feel warm on that side?

P: Uhm I can't really tell if it's warm or not.

D: OK, and you so you mentioned are you able to bend your elbow all the way up so to flex it all the way up, or is a range of motion limited?

P: It's pretty limited. It's pretty tough to flex. It's really painful and that I also can't like. I can't turn my arm, I can't supinate.

D: OK so yeah, so is that so you have reduced supination as well?

P: Yeah.

D: And how are your shoulder movement, are you able to like if you're lifting your arms straight out in front of you, are you able to to lift them all the way up above your head?

P: Out like at the sides or in front of me?

D: In front of you. 

P: Yeah, the shoulder seems to be OK. I am able to lift up, but it's just if I try to move my upper arms at all it hurts a lot.

D: OK, alright so. You'll get some pain at the at the shoulder with the movement.

P: There there is discomfort in the affected side, but I can I can move it much more than I can move my elbows or anything like that. 

D: OK, I see. So I think that was everything that I wanted to ask about and and I look for on on the physical today. Was there anything I may be missed or anything like that? 

P: Uhm no I think, uh, I don't have any other questions.

D: OK, alright, so based on the history and what you're telling me for the physical as well of having a history of exercising and also shoulder pain with overhead head movements which are risk factors for developing a biceps, tendon tear or biceps tendon injury. And having the swelling and bruising as well as reduced function of biceps or elbow flexion, they all suggests that there is a biceps, tendon tear, or injury there, and so will want to get an ultrasound or MRI to look at will start with the ultrasound, but then possibly get an MRI as well to look at the extent of the tissue damage, but if there is just a long head of biceps tear, it will usually be treated conservatively. And so we'll just need to look to see what the extent of the injury is.

P: Yeah, any swelling or redness, I do see some just like kind of like in the middle of this area, some redness kind of looks like some bruising in in that in that region. Uhm, I also feel like when I like try to flex my biceps kind of have moved upwards.

D: OK, is this the mass or lump that I you were mentioning earlier that you kinda can notice in the in your right arm? 

P: Yeah yeah.

D: OK, is there any temperature change, like does it feel warm on that side?

P: Uhm I can't really tell if it's warm or not.

D: OK, and you so you mentioned are you able to bend your elbow all the way up so to flex it all the way up, or is a range of motion limited?

P: It's pretty limited. It's pretty tough to flex. It's really painful and that I also can't like. I can't turn my arm, I can't supinate.

D: OK so yeah, so is that so you have reduced supination as well?

P: Yeah.

D: And how are your shoulder movement, are you able to like if you're lifting your arms straight out in front of you, are you able to to lift them all the way up above your head?

P: Out like at the sides or in front of me?

D: In front of you. 

P: Yeah, the shoulder seems to be OK. I am able to lift up, but it's just if I try to move my upper arms at all it hurts a lot.

D: OK, alright so. You'll get some pain at the at the shoulder with the movement.

P: There there is discomfort in the affected side, but I can I can move it much more than I can move my elbows or anything like that. 

D: OK, I see. So I think that was everything that I wanted to ask about and and I look for on on the physical today. Was there anything I may be missed or anything like that? 

P: Uhm no I think, uh, I don't have any other questions.

D: OK, alright, so based on the history and what you're telling me for the physical as well of having a history of exercising and also shoulder pain with overhead head movements which are risk factors for developing a biceps, tendon tear or biceps tendon injury. And having the swelling and bruising as well as reduced function of biceps or elbow flexion, they all suggests that there is a biceps, tendon tear, or injury there, and so will want to get an ultrasound or MRI to look at will start with the ultrasound, but then possibly get an MRI as well to look at the extent of the tissue damage, but if there is just a long head of biceps tear, it will usually be treated conservatively. And so we'll just need to look to see what the extent of the injury is.

P: OK.","D: How may I help you? 

P: I just came in because I've been having this just just yesterday it started this sudden just pain over the front of my kind of like a shoulder an also elbow and it was right after doing I was just doing some workout and this pain just started and it's just like a stabbing sharp pain that hasn't really gone away since then.

D: OK, and so what activity were you doing specifically? 

P: So I was doing so I was just doing weight training and I was kind of flexing my elbows and I was working on my biceps. I was on that machine where you so know I wasn't using weights or doing curls, but I was working on my biceps and I think I did hear, I don't think I heard like any pop or anything, but right after that I just had this sudden sharp pain in my shoulder as well as my elbow.

D: OK, so you you you think you heard a pop at that time?

P: Um I'm not sure if I heard a pop. Actually, I think I might have though.

D: OK, and did the pain start immediately or or a bit later on?

P: The pain I think it started pretty soon after, like probably within like half an hour of that happening.

D: OK. And where is the pain located now?

P: The pain right now is a. Yeah, just kind of right at the front of my right elbow as well as near my shoulder as well.

D"" OK. And. Um I think you mentioned the pain as as being sharp is that how you would describe the character of the pain?

P: Yeah, it's sharp. Yeah, I just feel like something stabbing in there.

D: OK, and does the pain radiate anywhere else?

P: No, it's kind of in the same area as they described.

D: OK, has there been anything you've tried to make the pain better?

P: No nothings I tried like Advil nothings really worked. 

D: OK. And, uh, sorry. How long is how many days is the pain been on going on for just just started yesterday?

P: Yesterday.

D: OK, and since then has the pain getting any better or any worse?

P: I think it's the same, probably a bit worse than so it just happened last evening and I I didn't end up coming last night, but I wanted to make sure. I'm just coming this morning since it's just been a really painful night.

D: OK, have you done anything that's made the pain worse since last night?

P: No I just tried to just rest and I tried to use some ice, but nothing. Nothing's been working and I kind of also have like this. It it's weird, it's just like this mass right where my biceps is. It kind of just makes my biceps look really big.

D: OK, alright, well I skip look at that during the physical exam component thank you and so like are you seeing swell is there like swelling there is as well or is is that part painful?

P: Yeah, it's painful there swelling there as well.

D: OK. And well, how severe is the pain on a scale of 10 to 1, 10 being the worst pain that you've ever experienced and one being the least.

P: Probably at least an 8, maybe a 9.

D: OK, so the pain is pretty severe then it sounds like. Uh, OK. Have you had any fevers or chills? 

P: No.

D: Have you had any unexpected weight loss?

P: No.

D: OK, and have you had any appetite loss?

P: Uhm no.

D: OK, and have you had any headaches?

P: Uhm no. 

D: How about any sensory changes like changes to vision or hearing?

D: Alright, and have you had any neurological symptoms such as numbness or tingling?

P: No, I don't think so. 

D: OK, and have you had any muscle weakness?

P: Just just in the in that area, I can't really like. I can't really flex an really move my upper upper arm in my elbow. 

D: OK. Do you have any pains in any other joints? 

P: Um no that's it's only my right upper arm.

D: OK. Um. And. Have you had any confusion or memory loss?

P: No. OK. And in the past, have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?

P: Uhm no I've been pretty healthy, um I they think I do have like pre diabetes but I'm not on any medication.

D: OK, and have you had any issues with your shoulder before like like a subacromial like impingement syndrome or like a rotator cuff pains or problems in the past?

P: A few years ago I did have some pain um with like some, they they told me not to do like overhead work like just things that require like with Physio I need to do some strengthening as well and it was it wasn't the same same shoulder.

D: OK. And do you take any medications regularly?

P: Uh, no.

D: OK, and do you have any allergies?

P: No.

D: Have you had any hospitalizations or prior surgeries? 

P: I had my tonsils removed when I was probably like 10 or something, but that's about it.

D: OK, and for the shoulder in the past did you have any imaging done like an ultrasound or or MRI maybe to look at the structures?

P: No, it was just a it kind of went away. I just did some physio they didn't really do any imaging.

D: I see OK. And can you tell me a little about your living situation right now, like you're living with and where?

P: Yeah so I'm living with my wife and um daughter and I'm living just in a condominium in the city.

D: OK, and are you working right now?

P: Yeah, so I'm an accountant. I'm working from home, so it's not that bad, but I I might just take a few days off depending on what I have to do with this injury.

D: OK, and um do you and hobby wise you mentioned like weight lifting, are you an active person like bodybuilding and that sort of thing regularly? 

P: I I just actually probably started this past year. I used to. I used to workout a lot. In University and in my early 30s but then I stopped and this year I've kind of gone back into it.

D: OK, well it's good that you're staying active. And um do you smoke cigarettes?

P: No, I uh, probably tried a couple times and. High School and University, but just it was never my thing.

D: OK, and how about cannabis, like smoking marijuana or using any of those types of products?

P: No, I I try to stay away from any drugs.

D: OK, uh, including recreational drugs?

P: Yeah.

D: OK and. Uh, are there any musculoskeletal or neurological problems that that run in the family?

P: Not that I know of, no.

D: OK, now how about any autoimmune diseases?

P: Uh, no, I don't think so.

D: OK, so next I just wanted to ask you to have a look at the at the arm. Compared to the other side, are you noticing any swelling, redness, or?

P: Yeah, any swelling or redness, I do see some just like kind of like in the middle of this area, some redness kind of looks like some bruising in in that in that region. Uhm, I also feel like when I like try to flex my biceps kind of have moved upwards.

[Speaker 1]: So, What brought you here today?
00:04:99

00:06:100
[Speaker 2]: Doctor, I have been having shortness of breath, and I have been feeling fatigue for the past two weeks. The pain is just so much; you know how bad it is when you are struggling with your breath. Then another thing is fatigue. The fatigue  is just constant, it never goes, it doesn't want to go.
00:32:98


00:34:99
[Speaker 1]: Okay, So can you tell me more about it?
00:37:03

00:37:98
[Speaker 2]: When it starts, it feels as if I am, I am looking for my breath, as in, as in I am gasping for my breath, like something is choking me, as if I am going to die the next minute and it actually started small gradually.
00:57:99

00:59:01
[Speaker 1]: Okay. I will be asking you few more questions about that. You said shortness of breath started gradually. Can you explain on the fatigue, Is there any thing you do that makes it worse?
01:12:00

01:12:98
[Speaker 2]: Yes Doctor. The fatigue is just constant. It doesn't go at all and it doesn't matter what I do, it will still be there and it doesn't even have any time that it use to come. I always feel the same way morning, afternoon and night. The thing is just there.
01:36:02

01:38:99
[Speaker 1]: Okay, Is there any other symptoms you get, like chest pain, palpitation, dizziness, or fainting?
01:44:00


01:45:02
[Speaker 2]: No, not at all, just cough.
01:53:01

01:54:98
[Speaker 1]: Okay, When the cough comes, How long does it last? Does it come during the day or at night? At what time does it normally come?
02:02:03

02:04:01
[Speaker 2]: The truth is that the cough comes, it comes on its own, but mostly, it used to come at night. It used to disturb me well at night.
02:17:00

02:18:99
[Speaker 1]: Okay, Is there any other thing that makes the shortness of breath worse? Like standing up, lying flat, exertion? Do you feel relieved by any of those things?
02:29:98

02:31:04
[Speaker 2]: Yes, yes it's worse on exertion and even when I'm lying flat. But, but whenever I shift like this and sit down, sit up, I will feel better. The thing will no longer be disturbing me that much again. So I think its better when I'm sitting up.
02:55:01

02:56:98
[Speaker 1]: Okay, on a scale of 1-10, Can you describe how bad it is?

08:51:01

08:53:00
[Speaker 1]: Okay, I'm going to go through what we've discussed so that anything I said and it wasn't what you said, you now let me know. 
At first, you said you are having shortness of breath, and you are feeling fatigued for the past two weeks, and the pain is just too much on you, the pain is just too much on you, and you do struggle with your breath, and the fatigue is constant. Okay, like something is choking you like you are going to die in next minute, and you said that it started gradually. Okay, like both in the morning, afternoon, and night, the fatigue is constant, and you said the shortness of breath is usually worse, like when you are lying and doing exertion, and on a scale of 10 and you also said your father died of stroke at 60 years. 
You said you have pain and swelling in your legs and abdomen, and your cough is usually dry; you also said your mom is diabetic. Okay, and you are hypertensive. Okay, and you do smoke and drink alcohol, too, but you smoke more than alcohol. And you don't take any recreational drugs. Okay, I just want to let you know that all these questions are as relevant as treatment. From the questions, we get the symptoms, and then we know the next step to follow. Okay, and you live with your wife and your daughter of ten years. Okay, you don't live alone, and you've never traveled abroad.","So, What brought you here today?
00:04:99

00:06:100
[Speaker 2]: Doctor, I have been having shortness of breath, and I have been feeling fatigue for the past two weeks. The pain is just so much; you know how bad it is when you are struggling with your breath. Then another thing is fatigue. The fatigue  is just constant, it never goes, it doesn't want to go.
00:32:98


Okay, So can you tell me more about it?
00:37:03

When it starts, it feels as if I am, I am looking for my breath, as in, as in I am gasping for my breath, like something is choking me, as if I am going to die the next minute and it actually started small gradually.
00:57:99

Okay. I will be asking you few more questions about that. You said shortness of breath started gradually. Can you explain on the fatigue, Is there any thing you do that makes it worse?
01:12:00

Yes Doctor. The fatigue is just constant. It doesn't go at all and it doesn't matter what I do, it will still be there and it doesn't even have any time that it use to come. I always feel the same way morning, afternoon and night. The thing is just there.
01:36:02

Okay, Is there any other symptoms you get, like chest pain, palpitation, dizziness, or fainting?
01:44:00


No, not at all, just cough.
01:53:01

Okay, When the cough comes, How long does it last? Does it come during the day or at night? At what time does it normally come?
02:02:03

The truth is that the cough comes, it comes on its own, but mostly, it used to come at night. It used to disturb me well at night.
02:17:00

Okay, Is there any other thing that makes the shortness of breath worse? Like standing up, lying flat, exertion? Do you feel relieved by any of those things?
02:29:98

Yes, yes it's worse on exertion and even when I'm lying flat. But, but whenever I shift like this and sit down, sit up, I will feel better. The thing will no longer be disturbing me that much again. So I think its better when I'm sitting up.
02:55:01

Okay, on a scale of 1-10, Can you describe how bad it is?
03:01:02

03:02:100

00:07:97
[Speaker 1]: Okay. So, what brought you to our hospital today?

00:12:01
[Speaker 2]: I have been experiencing pain and swelling in my left leg, It started about two weeks ago and the pain has been constant.

00:20:01
[Speaker 1]: Sorry about that. 

00:21:98
[Speaker 2]: Thank you, Doctor.

00:22:98
[Speaker 1]: So, about the pain, Did the pain start suddenly or gradually?

00:28:96
[Speaker 2]: It started gradually.

00:31:02
[Speaker 1]: So, on a scale of 0-10, 0 being no pain at all and 10 being the worst pain ever, How severe is the pain, and how would you rate the pain?

00:41:98
[Speaker 2]: About 8 out of 10 in severity.

00:45:02
[Speaker 1]: That means you are feeling pain. Sorry about that.

00:49:98
[Speaker 2]: Thank you, Doctor.

00:50:98
[Speaker 1]: So, Is the pain radiating? Is it moving to any other part of the leg or body?

00:56:00
[Speaker 2]: No, Doctor. The only thing is that the swelling and pain are in the same area. They are both localized to my left lower leg, and the swelling is gradually increasing in size.

01:11:96
[Speaker 1]: Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pain and swelling?

01:16:98
[Speaker 2]: Yes, I've been having a high-grade fever, especially at night. It's been coming and going.

[Speaker 1]: Okay, Have you experienced any recent injury to your leg or traveled anywhere recently?

01:31:98
[Speaker 2]: No, There haven't been any injuries, and I haven't traveled anywhere recently.

01:37:100

01:43:99
[Speaker 2]: Yes, I have tried, but they haven't helped much.

01:48:01
[Speaker 1]: Sorry about that.

01:49:97
[Speaker 2]: Thank you.

01:50:99
[Speaker 1]: So, have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your left leg?

01:56:96
[Speaker 2]: Yes, now that you mentioned it, I have felt some tingling sensations.

02:03:01
[Speaker 1]: Okay, Thank you for mentioning that. You know numbness and tingling can be important symptoms to note so that's why I asked you. So, with this along with the pain and swelling, could also indicate nerve involvement or compression. so, we'll definitely  take that into consideration when doing our examination. so, Miss Kemi, Lets discuss about your medical history.

05:35:01
[Speaker 2]: Okay, Doctor

05:38:00
[Speaker 1]: Okay, so based on your symptoms and examination,it's possible that you have a condition called deep vein thrombosis, which is a blood clot in one of the deep veins in your leg. This can cause pain, swelling and fever especially if the clot breaks loose and travels to your lungs causing a pulmonary embolism. However, we will need to confirm this with some tests, such as an ultrasound of your leg, and we will also check for any signs of infection, such as cellulitis. In the meantime, we are going to prescribe some drugs, some medication to help with the pain and the swelling. so, that's what we're gonna do for now.

[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. So a family history of cancer especially colorectal cancer and breast cancer can increase your risk for developing certain cancers. But now let's talk about your social history. Do you drink or smoke?

03:55:100
[Speaker 2]: I don't smoke and i quit about 10 years ago but i do drink on occasional events 

04:06:02
[Speaker 1]: That's great. Quiting smoking can be significantly reduce your of developing several types of cancer. Now let's move on to allergies. Do you have known allergies either to medications or other substance?

04:29:99
[Speaker 2]: No. I don't have any known allergies. I have never had any issues with medication or anything else like that 

04:38:01
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. Now based on your symptoms and family history and social history there are few possible conditions that could be causing these symptoms. One possibility as you mentioned is colorectal cancer and other possibility include  inflammatory bowel disease, polyps or hemorrhoids and diverticulosis. To confirm all these conditions i would like to have some test including colonoscopy and blood test 

05:21:00
[Speaker 2]: A colonoscopy sounds a bit intimidating. Can you tell me more about what it involves? And what you expect to find? 

05:33:98
[Speaker 1]: I understand your concern and i may know a colonoscopy is a procedure where a flexible tube and a camera is inserted through the rectum and into the colon. You know, to examine of the large intestine. So it is very common and safe procedure that is used to screen for and diagnosed for colon and rectum condition. So i expect to find the cause of your symptoms whether it is cancer, polyps or something else. So you see during the colonoscopy if we find any polyps or areas of concern, we can remove small samples of the tissue for further examination. This is known as biopsy. We can also take biopsies of any abnormal looking areas in the colon lining. So to sample will then be sent to a lab for analysis to determine if they are cancerous or benign 

06:44:03
[Speaker 2]: What will happen if biopsy result shows that i have cancer doctor?

06:52:02
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Excuse me, if the biopsy results comes back as positive for cancer then we will discuss the best treatment options for you 

07:08:98
[Speaker 2]: Thank you for answering all my questions doctor. I feel a bit more informed now but also more nervous about the possibility of a cancer

07:20:01
[Speaker 1]: I understand how you feel but remember that catching any potential issues early can make a big difference. I am here to support you through this process and i will schedule the test and i will take one step at a time. So please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns 

07:45:02
[Speaker 2]: Thank you. I will be waiting for the test result and i appreciate your help 

07:50:99
[Speaker 1]: You are very much welcome. 

So based on my findings from the symptoms you shared and the information shared from the patient. There's rectal bleeding for two weeks worsening over time and change in bowel habit. There's no significant past medical history, Family history and there's also family history of colorectal and breast cancer. There's no current smoking but occasional alcohol consumption and there are no allergies. So the possible diagnosis includes colorectal cancer which is the most likely based on the symptom, family history and also social history and also the second diagnosis could be inflammatory bowel disease which is known as the IBD which is less likely due to lack of abdominal pain or diarrhea.""

The patient, a 45 year old female complains of frequent urination and excessive thirst which has lasted for 2 weeks, and this frequent urination occurs mostly at night. And the patient complains, says there is no burning sensation or associated pain during urination. My diagnosis is, I suspect the patient has diabetes mellitus specifically type 2 diabetes. The symptoms of frequent urination, excessive thirst, fatigue and unintentional weight loss are classic signs of diabetes. For further diagnosis, I will request a fasting plasma glucose test and a oral glucose tolerance test.

According to her, the pain becomes worst after eating especially when she eats fatty food. The pain is associated with nausea and vomiting. Fever and jaundice. She doesn't have any history of change in bowel movement or urine color, weight loss or loss of appetite. She doesn't also have any history of trauma or haven't under gone any surgery. According to her medical history she was diagnosed of hypertension five years ago. And has been on medication. The only family medical history she has is her mother where had gastrings. She doesn't smoke nor take any recreational drugs but drinks alcohol occasionally. She is also on anti-hypertensive medication. She doesn't have any known drugs or food allergy. She also rated the pain to 9 on a scale of 1-10

[Speaker 1]: From my findings, Mrs. Oge, age 26, is having severe and persistent vomiting, which has lasted for 2 weeks now. She finds it difficult to keep down food or liquid. She started vomiting undigested food recently but is no blood or bile on it. The condition is associated with severe nausea and weight loss. She doesn't have any history of fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain or headache. Her last menstrual period was 8 weeks ago and her pregnancy test read positive. She has no history of similar symptoms in the previous pregnancy, neither does the condition occur when she's not pregnant. She hasn't done any surgery in the past and doesn't have any chronic illness. She also have no family history of similar illness. Mrs. Oge, according to her, does not smoke nor drink. She's not also in any prescription drugs, but she maintained that she started prenatal vitamins after she confirmed pregnant. She doesn't have any known food or drug allergies.

I want to do a general examination and then I want to examine parts of your body and then afterwards I would like to run some investigation. I am really suspecting that you might be having some form of malaria since you stay in a malaria endemic area and you do not sleep under mosquito net or insect repellent. In your family do you have anyone with this same problems? Your children or your husband, is there anyone with this form of, with a similar problem as this?
