The patient, a 45 year old female complains of frequent urination and excessive thirst which has lasted for 2 weeks, and this frequent urination occurs mostly at night. And the patient complains, says there is no burning sensation or associated pain during urination. My diagnosis is, I suspect the patient has diabetes mellitus specifically type 2 diabetes. The symptoms of frequent urination, excessive thirst, fatigue and unintentional weight loss are classic signs of diabetes. For further diagnosis, I will request a fasting plasma glucose test and a oral glucose tolerance test.

[Speaker 1]: So, What brought you here today?
00:04:99

00:06:100
[Speaker 2]: Doctor, I have been having shortness of breath, and I have been feeling fatigue for the past two weeks. The pain is just so much; you know how bad it is when you are struggling with your breath. Then another thing is fatigue. The fatigue  is just constant, it never goes, it doesn't want to go.
00:32:98


00:34:99
[Speaker 1]: Okay, So can you tell me more about it?
00:37:03

00:37:98
[Speaker 2]: When it starts, it feels as if I am, I am looking for my breath, as in, as in I am gasping for my breath, like something is choking me, as if I am going to die the next minute and it actually started small gradually.
00:57:99

00:59:01
[Speaker 1]: Okay. I will be asking you few more questions about that. You said shortness of breath started gradually. Can you explain on the fatigue, Is there any thing you do that makes it worse?
01:12:00

01:12:98
[Speaker 2]: Yes Doctor. The fatigue is just constant. It doesn't go at all and it doesn't matter what I do, it will still be there and it doesn't even have any time that it use to come. I always feel the same way morning, afternoon and night. The thing is just there.
01:36:02

01:38:99
[Speaker 1]: Okay, Is there any other symptoms you get, like chest pain, palpitation, dizziness, or fainting?
01:44:00


01:45:02
[Speaker 2]: No, not at all, just cough.
01:53:01

01:54:98
[Speaker 1]: Okay, When the cough comes, How long does it last? Does it come during the day or at night? At what time does it normally come?
02:02:03

02:04:01
[Speaker 2]: The truth is that the cough comes, it comes on its own, but mostly, it used to come at night. It used to disturb me well at night.
02:17:00

02:18:99
[Speaker 1]: Okay, Is there any other thing that makes the shortness of breath worse? Like standing up, lying flat, exertion? Do you feel relieved by any of those things?
02:29:98

02:31:04
[Speaker 2]: Yes, yes it's worse on exertion and even when I'm lying flat. But, but whenever I shift like this and sit down, sit up, I will feel better. The thing will no longer be disturbing me that much again. So I think its better when I'm sitting up.
02:55:01

02:56:98
[Speaker 1]: Okay, on a scale of 1-10, Can you describe how bad it is?
03:01:02

[Speaker 2]: I would say 10 Doc. 10
03:06:01

03:07:01

[Speaker 2]: Ok. Doctor i have been experiencing rectal bleeding for the past two weeks and it is gotten worse. Starting off as a little bit of blood in my stool but now there's quite alot of bright red blood mixed in. I have also had change of this in my bowel cavity, going from regular to alternating between my constipation and diarrhea and i have lost some weight unintentionally and i have been feeling really tired lately 

00:36:03
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Giving these symptoms. Can i? I want to start by asking you a few more questions to understand your condition better. First is have you notice any blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet room?

01:02:01
[Speaker 2]: Yes. I definitely notice blood on the toilet paper. Sometimes there's even blood dripping into the toilet after i finished going into the bathroom 

01:16:99
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That a significant amount of bleeding. So i want to investigate on this further. So i want to ask you about your diet. Have you notice any changes in your appetite or the food you're eating? 

01:35:03
[Speaker 2]: To be honest, my appetite has been i little bit up lately. I have been feeling an unusual. I have been having to force myself to eat sometimes. I haven't really made a big changes to my diet though

01:53:02
[Speaker 1]: Ok. So Thank you for sharing this information. I have a few more questions to ask about your medical history and family history and all. First can you tell me about your past medical history including any surgeries or hospitalizations?

02:21:00
[Speaker 2]: I haven't really had any major surgeries or hospitalizations in the past. I have high blood pressure but it is well controlled with medication 

02:33:98
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That's good to hear. And regarding your family history can you tell me about your family history either your mom or your dad?

02:54:03
[Speaker 2]: Regarding my family. My father passed away from colorectal cancer 

03:02:02
[Speaker 1]: Ok

03:04:02
[Speaker 2]: That's about it and my mother has breast cancer about 10 years ago but she's been in remission for several years now. I think other than that I can't think of any other illness or cancers that run in my family 

03:23:98
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. So a family history of cancer especially colorectal cancer and breast cancer can increase your risk for developing certain cancers. But now let's talk about your social history. Do you drink or smoke?

03:55:100
[Speaker 2]: I don't smoke and i quit about 10 years ago but i do drink on occasional events 

04:06:02
[Speaker 1]: That's great. Quiting smoking can be significantly reduce your of developing several types of cancer. Now let's move on to allergies. Do you have known allergies either to medications or other substance?

04:29:99
[Speaker 2]: No. I don't have any known allergies. I have never had any issues with medication or anything else like that 

04:38:01
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. Now based on your symptoms and family history and social history there are few possible conditions that could be causing these symptoms. One possibility as you mentioned is colorectal cancer and other possibility include  inflammatory bowel disease, polyps or hemorrhoids and diverticulosis. To confirm all these conditions i would like to have some test including colonoscopy and blood test 

05:21:00
[Speaker 2]: A colonoscopy sounds a bit intimidating. Can you tell me more about what it involves? And what you expect to find? 

05:33:98
[Speaker 1]: I understand your concern and i may know a colonoscopy is a procedure where a flexible tube and a camera is inserted through the rectum and into the colon. You know, to examine of the large intestine. So it is very common and safe procedure that is used to screen for and diagnosed for colon and rectum condition. So i expect to find the cause of your symptoms whether it is cancer, polyps or something else. So you see during the colonoscopy if we find any polyps or areas of concern, we can remove small samples of the tissue for further examination. This is known as biopsy. We can also take biopsies of any abnormal looking areas in the colon lining. So to sample will then be sent to a lab for analysis to determine if they are cancerous or benign 

06:44:03
[Speaker 2]: What will happen if biopsy result shows that i have cancer doctor?

06:52:02
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Excuse me, if the biopsy results comes back as positive for cancer then we will discuss the best treatment options for you 

07:08:98
[Speaker 2]: Thank you for answering all my questions doctor. I feel a bit more informed now but also more nervous about the possibility of a cancer

07:20:01
[Speaker 1]: I understand how you feel but remember that catching any potential issues early can make a big difference. I am here to support you through this process and i will schedule the test and i will take one step at a time. So please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns 

07:45:02
[Speaker 2]: Thank you. I will be waiting for the test result and i appreciate your help 

07:50:99
[Speaker 1]: You are very much welcome. 

So based on my findings from the symptoms you shared and the information shared from the patient. There's rectal bleeding for two weeks worsening over time and change in bowel habit. There's no significant past medical history, Family history and there's also family history of colorectal and breast cancer. There's no current smoking but occasional alcohol consumption and there are no allergies. So the possible diagnosis includes colorectal cancer which is the most likely based on the symptom, family history and also social history and also the second diagnosis could be inflammatory bowel disease which is known as the IBD which is less likely due to lack of abdominal pain or diarrhea.""

05:02:96
[Speaker 1]: Okay, so thank you Kemi. Based on your responses, your gynaecological health seems to be normal. now lets continue with the examination of your leg. so based on your on our discussion, i'll like to perform a physical examination to better understand what might be causing your symptoms. we'll start by examining your leg, your left leg and checking your temperature.

05:35:01
[Speaker 2]: Okay, Doctor

05:38:00
[Speaker 1]: Okay, so based on your symptoms and examination,it's possible that you have a condition called deep vein thrombosis, which is a blood clot in one of the deep veins in your leg. This can cause pain, swelling and fever especially if the clot breaks loose and travels to your lungs causing a pulmonary embolism. However, we will need to confirm this with some tests, such as an ultrasound of your leg, and we will also check for any signs of infection, such as cellulitis. In the meantime, we are going to prescribe some drugs, some medication to help with the pain and the swelling. so, that's what we're gonna do for now.

06:31:98
[Speaker 2]: Okay sir. thank you, doctor,

06:33:96
[Speaker 1]: okay, so is there anything else you'll like to discuss?

06:37:01
[Speaker 2]: No, Doctor. Thank you for your help.

06:39:98

I'm not fine. My daughter is not fine, So I'm not fine. So what's…what's wrong with her? She started running temperature yesterday, started running temperature yesterday and then I checked, I checked the temperature it was, it was about 38.1°C at home and then today she…she started jerking her arms and her legs. So the complaint, so the complaint is the fever and the jerking of the hands and legs. So when the fever started, was it like low grade? I just noticed that her body was, her body was very hot. It was very hot. So I decided to check with my thermometer at home and it was 38.1. OK, 38.1 OK. Did you did you use any…was there anything you did that like, brought the fever down? Did you give her anything at all to bring the fever down? I...I know that we needed, we needed to like clean her body with water. So still on the fever, I'll like to ask you other few questions. She was not coughing. She was not coughing at any point. She was not coughing. OK, alright cool. Did you notice any discharge from her ear or from her nose or her eyes, anything like that at all? I have not noticed anything. OK, OK cool. She…she never gave any complaints like that. Although, she…she really does not have appetite now because she's not been eating well since the fever started. She's not been eating well. She never complained of…of pain in her throat when… OK, is there…OK that's fine. There was no vomiting at all. There was no vomiting. OK, Did you notice that she was passing any loose stool? Was she going to the toilet frequently and was passing loose stool? Anything like that? She…the only thing that I noticed was that she usually cries when she wants to Asides that, she was not stooling she was not vomiting. I don't know what is going on, doctor. OK, cool, cool. I was getting to that too. I don't know if she feels pain, but she says she's usually crying, usually crying when she wants to urinate, Alright. Usually…usually…usually for her age, usually in children that like, cannot properly express emotions, so, most of the time…most of the time…most of the time, when a child is crying, when she pees, it's most likely due to pain, right? OK. You think the…the pain she's feeling what is causing that fever? So I'm…I'm…I'm getting to it. I'm getting to it. OK. Okay, so the jerky movement, right? Everything was fine. Everything was fine. like how long, how long did it last for? Like how long did you see that… It lasted about…lasted about 3 minutes or thereabout. OK, cool It only happened once, it only happened once immediately afterwards, I brought her immediately to the hospital to see the doctor. OK, cool, Beautiful. So it happened just once, right. I'm as shocked, 'cause this is the first time I'm seeing something like this happen. OK, OK, All right, All right, cool. Yes, She's my first daughter, yes First daughter, and I make sure that she gets all her  immunization. I don't know,  what's going on. You said she…she has…erm immunization. Yes, I have the card, I make sure I take her to get all the immunization. And when she was younger, there was… She had no complications… when she was, when she was there, when she was… when she was newly delivered, like, you know, during her like her first one month or after she was…after… after delivery, there wasn't…She had no, like any type of yellowness of the eyes. No, there was, there was nothing, nothing like that. There was nothing, everything was fine. And she did not have she… And she cried immediately after birth, or it took a while for that to happen? She cried immediately. OK. OK. All right. Cool. Nothing, Nothing at all. Her pregnancy and antenatal, everything was fine, she delivered by herself. OK and she delivered herself, right? Yes OK. OK So, erm OK, so cool from the…everything I've asked you right now… And how old is your daughter, too, by the way? Just to be sure She …I said she’s 3… She's 3. She's 3 years old. Alright, so from everything I've asked you, OK, three. Doctor, her own lasted…her own lasted about 3 minutes. So you mean she was convulsing? Yes she had an episode of convulsion but was a single…it was a singular episode and the cause of…and the cause of the…of the convulsion is due to some bacterial infection that manifested as fever. So that's what brings us to the complaints about her having the…having… crying when she was peeing. So the focus of the fever could come from like the urinary tract infection. So in this case, to properly investigate and get to the root of the matter, to properly treat her, right. So she would need to do some basic investigations, the first things first in this case of fever is to do a full blood count. I hope…I hope she is not going to have another convulsion before then, ‘cause I am really scared. No No No…Based on, based on the fact that…based on…based on everything I've asked you, no, don't worry, she’ll be fine. how are we going to take care of the convulsion now? ‘cause I’m really scared No, so as soon as the results of the… of the labs we do is out, so we'll... we'll just try and treat the UTI, we'll place her on antibiotics, right. So, the antibiotics will take care of the urinary tract infection. But you said the result will take about 72 hours, that's like 3 days. no, first… so the…the result of the urinalysis too, if the…if we…if we can pick out any positive from the urinalysis, we can start her on some erm… some antibiotics first, pending the time the urine MCS comes out right. But her temperature is still quite high. I just… I still checked recently before… before coming. Yeah. Yeah. We also take care of that. We'll give… we'll give her antipyretics for that. You're sure she's going to be fine? Yes, she'll be fine for sure, for sure. Then, I hope this is not going to happen again What did you say? I can't hear you properly, I hope it’s not going to happen again it's…so far…the thing is, so far the causative organism, so far the cause, the cause is not in play, then it will likely not happen again. Doctor, I try my possible best to do that. As you know urinary tract infections are ubiquitous. No problem, Doctor. Thank you very much. I really appreciate your help.",774.816,med-convo-nig

Do you have any known drug allergies? No, I don't. Is there any routine drug you are on currently? I'm not on any medications right now. OK. All right. Mrs Tolulope, I've been able to listen to all your complaints. No, not not really. OK, so we have a thyroid gland that's located in our neck and the anterior part of our neck that helps with our body metabolism. It helps to keep our body regulation in check, you understand. So, it produces some hormones and, in that case, it looks like one of the hormones is overproduced. means it's produced more than what it should produce. That is why it's given some of the symptoms you've complained of today. What I would need to do for you is I'm going to carry out some investigations for you. It's… first investigation is going to be the thyroid function test which we're going to look at all the thyroid hormones to be sure If the hormone is actually… there's an imbalance in the thyroid hormones, then I'm also… all right. I'm also going to do just in thyroid scan just look at the thyroid gland in case there's an enlargement, although you did mention that there's no neck swelling, but it'll also be good to also have a look at thyroid grand OK. And also given the issue of the palpitations that you mentioned, that's your heart beating fast. It would also be safe to just look at the ECG to just be sure that the heart cont… Everything is going on fine there as well. OK. So we'll carry out all these tests and given your age and and well I think after we do the thyroid gland, it might not be out of place to also do you know maybe a just an aspiration of the thyroid gland But I think we should do the scan first and whatever the result says we would know what to do further from there. But pending the time, I'm going to place you on some beta blockers just to, you know, relieve the palpitations that you are feeling. OK OK, So I'm going to write out some prescriptions for you just to… so that you don't stay… it’ll stop, it’ll reduce the anxiety and the palpitations you're feeling, like atenolol and then I'm also going to give you some antithyroid drugs as well. All right. All right. I hope they're not too expensive. Oh, not at all. But I would write them out for you. So, do you have any other questions? No, no, for now. But if I do, I would, I'd definitely reach out, OK. So, if I may add too you know, because given the age you're 42, it is actually very common, you know in women at this age range, but just we can also want to rule out a thyroid cancer too. OK. So, after we carry out all these tests, we'll be able to figure out what we're dealing with here. So, starting with a thyroid hormone. So, do I have your go ahead? Yes, please. All right, Sir. OK, Thank you. Okay Doctor.",744.139,med-convo-nig
8_Stroke,data/final_audio/8_Stroke.wav,"Good evening, Sir. Yeah. Hello, good evening. Good evening. Good evening, doctor. How are you doing today, Sir? I'm fine, thank you. Yeah, So I'll be taking your complaints today. But, before then, can you please tell me your name? OK, So, my name is Mr Makinde. OK, how old are you? I'm 60 60 years old Sir. All right, So what's your complaint for today? The right side of my body. Yes. Is weak, is not, is not moving well at all. OK. So how long has that been going on for? It's about four hours ago. 4 hours. OK, what... exactly. I was watching Ball in the Parlor. I was watching Nigeria and South Africa. All of a sudden, I cannot move this my hand. All right. Did you collapse? Were you seated when it happened? Yes, I was seated. But, you know, we were watching match and everybody was jumping. OK. Can you tell me your last meal? My last what, Sir? Your last meal, Your last meal before the incident. Oh, it was the night. It was it. Maybe like 7, let's say 6-7 hours before then. But I was drinking something. All right, so your right arm and leg, is it just a little bit weak? Can you move it at all, or you can't move it at all? Can you move it a little bit? I could not, I could not move it very well. Then I also noticed that, you know, I could not talk very well. And there was... spit was coming out from my mouth. So but the weakness, the weak, the weakness has it… has it been progressing. Is it getting worse? Yes, it seems like it's getting worse, but no I can talk better now. But when the thing happened that time. It was just… I could not move my hand, I could not move my leg. I just stayed in one place and there was all spit dropping from my mouth. From your mouth, Yes. you able to talk? I could not talk very well. I was just… I could not talk. I was just looking, I could not say much. You could not say much. All right. So, was there any headache around when it happened? Yes. Before the match, the headache was very bad. I had very serious headache. All right. Can you see properly? Are you having any visual erm…? Not at all. Not at all. No, Sir. OK, how about breathing? Any difficulty breathing? No at all, Sir. So before the incident, you said you didn't collapse on the floor. You didn't collapse on the. You know, it's like someone should just…I was watching match and then the next thing I know, suddenly I just fell down like this. Not like I hit my head or anything, I just could not move my hand again, I could not move my leg again, I was just as if… I don't know what happened, It just happened suddenly like that. Oh, sorry about that. But basically, it sounds like you can recall everything that happened, so you had no memory loss? No at all. I remember everything happened now. I remember everything. How about any seizure? Did you? No seizure. Yes, At any point. I didn't know what, Sir. Lose consciousness at any point? No. All right, So, are you a known diabetic? No, I'm not, no. How about hypertension? Ahh... Yes Oh, you’re Hyper… Yes. OK. There… been any diagnosis made for any other heart conditions apart from hypertension? No. The doctor gave me some drugs for the blood pressure. But you know, its not easy... for a man to be… seeing a doctor for the blood… Sir? You've been seeing a doctor for the blood pressure? Yes, I have. But you know, it's not… It's not easy to be using drugs. They wrote some drugs for me, but I don't use it every day. Sometimes I use… I feel like the DP is high, I will use it Sometimes I don't use it. OK, that's not too good enough, Sir. It's very important that you use your drugs constantly and failure to comply erm… Failure to comply can lead to erm…what's happening to you currently. So how about the the clinic visits, do you go often? No, sometimes. I miss it, though. OK. All right. So how about drinks, do you take alcohol? You drink? Yes, I do. You drink. How about smoking? I smoke very well. All right. Have you had any family member have a similar situation before? Has this happened to any family member? Yes, actually, my daddy too that time they said it was heart attack that killed him. OK, so you have a dad that died from heart attack? Yes, Sir. All right, all right, all right. That's OK. Is it possible for you to read me your vital side? OK, my temperature was 36°. The pulse rate is 87 beats per minute, BP 160 / 100. All right Respiratory Rate is 12 cycles per minute and SP is 98%. All right, 98 percent 98. 8 8. All right, that's totally fine. Basically, from all that you've… you've told me so far, I have been able to gather that it is very likely that you have a stroke, although this has been going on for four hours, so we're not so sure whether it's permanent or not. So, it could either be a stroke or a transient ischemic attack. Both are basically almost the same thing, the only difference is the time with which they present and for now it's been about four hours at less than a day. So, it's still possible that it might reverse. So basically, what I want to do first is to send you for a test to know whether it's actually a stroke or not. So, you're going to be doing a scan, right? OK And this scan will tell us what kind of stroke, if it's a stroke, what kind of stroke is it? Because basically I have two types. Sorry, I didn't get that. What? What type of scan am I doing, Sir? Yes, you are going to do a CT scan. OK. Yes, you’re going to do a CT scan. My whole body? No, just your head. So, it's a scan that just gives us an image of what's going on in your head. We want to know whether any vessel ruptured, or any vessel is being blocked. Are you with me, Sir? I’m with you, Sir. All right, so that scan, you're going to tell us whether a vessel is being blocked or a vessel ruptured each. Both scenarios can present with similar symptoms, and so the scan is important for us to be able to differentiate between the two. However, then we'll still place you on oxygen and monitor your vitals very closely. Are you with me, Sir? Yes, I'm here. I'm with you, Sir. So, the results of the scan would determine the next line of management. So, if it is a… if it is a ischemic stroke would most likely want to place you on some anticoagulants and thrombolytic agents to break down the blood clots that is causing occlusion. However, if it is a… if it's an hemorrhagic stroke, we would want to place you on an antihypertensive that will make sure that the hemorrhage does not get worse. But it is very important that you go for that scan as soon as possible so that the condition does not worsen, and hopefully if it is not a stroke, we are hoping that some of these symptoms would reverse. Do you understand? Can I do the scan tomorrow? No, you can't. It's today as soon as possible. OK Sir. Yes please. So, do you have any questions for me? No, Sir, not at all. You've answered all my questions. All right, All right. That's great. So that would be the end for today's consultation. All right. Thank you, Doctor. You're welcome, Sir.",567.174,med-convo-nig

When, when you're walking do you hear some cracky sounds when you're walking? Sometimes I… I think I've had one of my because I'm I'm about 60 year old so I think one of my children told me months that kind of heard something like that when I when I walked past him, I don't know but I've, I've not really felt something like that, but I think about someone say something like that about it. The range of the range of movement of your joint, is it still the same? Are you in any way limited in the range of your… of the movement of your joint? Yes, yes, because of the pain, yes OK, no problem. Erm, I will just ask you some questions. Are you diabetic or hypertensive? No, I'm not.

No, no, no problem. Is there any fever? Not at all. Not at all. OK, no problem. Do you have any drug allergies? I only react, I only react to a particular type of antibiotics, to penicillin. I was told yes. That's all… React to Penicillins. OK, there is no problem. Is there anything else you want the doctor to know about? Doctor, other than my knee, I'm fine. I just want to know what's wrong with my knee and to get a proper solution to it Just to, just to have an holistic, holistic erm… erm… assessment of of my patients. I'd like to ask some other questions. So I want to ask you, do you have headaches? Any loss of consciousness? Not at all. OK, Do you have chest pain? No. At all. Any difficulty in breathing? No. Do you hear your heart beat fast? Not at all. Do you have any abdominal pain? Abdominal pain? No, No. Yes. No at all. Yeah, Any diarrhea? No. OK Do you have pain when you want to urinate or difficulty urinating? No. No, doctor. No. OK Are there times that you see crystals in your urine? When you say crystal, what do you mean by crystal, doctor? Like, like some stones. Small, small, small stones in your urine. I think I, recent… sometime ago, yes, I saw something that looks like what you describe, but I wasn't sure what it was. So,  I thought it is because I didn't take enough water. So, I think I took more water and I've not seen it in a while. So, but I think I remember seeing something like what you described once. There's no problem. So I'm going to go ahead and do a general examination on you just to check your if your pale, to check if you're jaundiced, to check if you're well hydrated, to check your lymph nodes. And then I'm also going to specially examine your… your knee to know the exact cause of the pain you're having to see if there's anything we can pick up that will help us in your management for this knee pain that you're having, do you understand? So, it will involve us examining the knee, moving the knee might make you a bit uncomfortable because of the pain you're having there. We want to see whether there's a swelling, whether there's a increase in the warmth of that place compared to your other knee, because I want to see whether it's tender, that is, it's it's very painful on on on pressing it, or whether the pain is only there when you want to move. And we also want to see if there's any cracking sound when we move the joints. Do you understand? So we think it could be an osteoarthritis which means the wear and tear of the joints of the knee which will now start causing pain with that. And then because of your history of drinking beer and then history of passing some stones in your urine, you think you could have also have a gouty arthritis in your in your knee. So we're going to run some investigations to to know the exact cause and the management to to put in place. We are going to need to do an X-ray of that leg, of the leg, lhat will involve seeing both joints, the joints above and the joints below, right. And then we are also going to request for some other blood tests like a complete blood count, a full block count to see if it's an effective process which could be a septic arthritis. And then we also need to do the erythrocyte sedimentation rates to show us whether there's an, it's an inflammatory process going on. It could be elevated in an inflammatory process and then we'll do a uric acid test. So, you know if your uric acid level is high which could be a sign of a guilty arthritis. Do you understand and after after the investigations we are going to start you, we are going to start you on some drugs to relieve your pain, but the main, mainstay of the treatment is going to be non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, I wanted to ask earlier, but do you have ulcer, are you a known peptic ulcer disease patients, No not at all OK because some of the drugs that we are going to give you could… could exacerbate peptic ulcer disease. So, we're going to give you some non steroidal anti inflammation drugs like ibuprofen, we can give you diclofenac, do you understand? And then we are going to give you some gel that you can apply topically for pain relief gel that you can apply topically that will help relieve the pain. All in all, if it's osteoarthritis where it's caused by wear and tear, you have to limit the usage of of that joint because the more you use the joint the more the wear and tear happens. There are other modalities of treatment, but it depends on the progression and how bad the, the knee, The knee is. Do you understand? it could involve replacement of the knee but depending on grade on how, of the osteoarthritis, do you understand what I'm saying? And then if it's a gouty arthritis would have to start you on some other drugs that would reduce the level of uric acid in your in your system and also relieve your… your pain. Do you understand? So that is that is what we're going to do. Do you have any questions for me, Sir? All right. So after all this is done, the pain, my pain, will… will it be, will it… Will it go away or do I have to live with this for the rest of my life or I don't, I'm trying to understand what, what is what, What is the prognosis of this going forward? If it is, if it is a, if it is the osteoarthritis. Like I said earlier, it's wear and tear. Do you understand? So the pain will come, but whenever you use your, your drugs, it's going to go away. It's going to go away for some time, but you might have to be on those drugs for some time. Do you understand? if it's a guilty arthritis. If you're uric acid level in the body is low, the pain is going to go and then will also treat you with the with the pain relief. But you have to stay away from… from some things like stop eating offals, you reduce the amount of beer you take. If you can stop fine. Do you understand? but we'll give you some drugs that will lower the level of your uric acid. Do you understand? So that is the modality of treatment for for it. Any other questions? Oh, I think that's fine. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much for your time.",924.256,med-convo-nig

So, OK, so you stay alone. You're not here in an overcrowded place. Yes, but yes. But Doctor, I noticed. What actually prompted me to come is the fact that about two days ago I noticed that the cough became worsened, and I was… I started to have some difficulty in breathing. So, like that got me really scared, like I was, I was, I was just feeling breathless for a moment. Comes and goes then, and since that, since then, the breathlessness has become more worsened. So that's what exactly prompted me to completely to see you. You're finding it difficult to breathe, Yes, Yes When you sleep at night, you sweat excessively. No, at all. I don't, I don't slept… I don't sweat when I sleep at night? OK, so what's what relieves the breathlessness? Any change in position that relieves the breathlessness or it’s constant? No, it's not associated with erm, any… any position, nothing. I just… it just comes and goes, like I just feel breathless for a while, then it relieves me. Then it comes again, especially when I'm especially when I'm coughing. OK. Has this worsened progressively? Yes, Yes… It has gotten very bad, doctor, that's why I came to the hospital. Does it affect, does it affect your daily activities? Yes, it does, doctor. I've not been able to work for the past two days because of the cough and the fact that I have, I've not been feeling well, generally in my body, so that's so, Now this fever that you were having, was it… did it start suddenly or gradually? It started. It started gradually, then became I became very hot and it has been like that, it has been like that. So, the fever is high grade, You're very hot? Yes… Yes, it's high. Did you at any point? Yes. Check by yourself at home your temperature? Yes, I did… I did, I have a thermometer, it was about was about 38.9. 38.9 OK and what does… what do you do that relieves the fever. I took some, I took some paracetamol. It relieved a bit, then but it did… didn't last long. I just I I became hot again and it has been like that ever since. So I just want to ask you some questions. Has anything happened before in the past? OK, Has it happened in the past? No, no, no, no. This is the first time I'm experiencing, that's why I'm… this is the first time I'm experiencing this kind of thing. OK, this is the first time. Are you.. do you have any medical condition? Like, are you asthmatic during your blood group and genotype? No, I'm not doctor, I'm fine. No, I have nothing. And that’s why this is Surprising. Are you hypertensive? What did you say? I can't hear you properly, Sir. Are you hypertensive or diabetic? None. None. None. None No, no. I have none of them… I have none of them. So, what have you... what have you done to care for yourself so far? I just… I just… I just tried to get some cough syrup, but they didn't… They didn't seem to work properly. They didn't seem to work and since the difficulty breathing started, I knew, I knew, I know I needed to like, come to speak to someone, to a doctor. So, that's why I came today, for you to like, for me to like, know what's wrong with me and treat myself, basically. Have you been, have you been admitted before? No, not, not, not that I can remember. Have you done any surgical procedure before? No, No. OK. So, I'm just going to ask you some other questions just to know what exactly could be related to your, to the symptoms you're having. So, do you have headache? Headache just comes once in a while, maybe 'cause the cough. I've not been able to sleep really. So, kind of, yeah, kind of, yes. OK. So, any loss of consciousness? No. No. No, No. OK, OK. Do you have Catarrh? No, at all. OK. Do you have any abdominal pain? No. No, I don't have any. Diarrhea or vomiting? No, I've not vomited at all. You have any bone pain? Yes. No, the no, the most. It's just, it's just the shortest of breath I've been having. The difficulty in breathing I've been having. That's just, that's just… So, in summary you're telling me, in summary you're telling me you had, you… you've had cough, fever and difficulty in breathing. Yes. Right and your cough is productive. Yes. All right, So I'm going to have to have to examine you, right. I'm going to have to examine you and I'm going to have to listen to your chest to know if, to know whatever is going on in your chest, whether there's a chest infection that is causing you to have a fever and the and the cough. Do you understand? And then we are going to have you do some investigations like a chest X-ray, a complete blood count, a full blood count which will tell us whether there's an infection going on, depending on the parameters that are elevated or reduced, do you understand? We are going to do you know, electrocyte segmentation rates to know whether there's an inflammatory process going on. Do you understand? And then we're also going to take your sputum, your… the phlegm and we're going to send it for culture, sensitivity to know what bacteria is, is being cultured. Erm, please, I just want to ask you, do you smoke? No. No, I don't, doctor, I'm a good Christian. I don’t smoke. I don't drink. You don't… You don't drink alcohol either. I don't, I don't do any of those, I don't do drugs, I don't do any of that. I'm going to ask you some other questions. Do you have… their kind of personal questions? Can I go ahead? Yeah. I just want to know, doctor, I just want to… I just want to be fine. I just want to know how soon you can start treating me and what I’ll need to take basically. I just want to ask if…I just want to ask if you have multiple sexual partners and then your sexual practices. No, no. You have oral sex? I'm married. No, not at all. Not at all. I'm married. So, we are going to start you, from the history and the examination we have done and then we're going to ask you to do some investigations. However, we have some differentials like diagnosis, the cause, the cause of what is causing the cough and the fever. We have some, this thing at the back of our mind, which could be the cause. Do you understand? We think you have a pneumonia, pneumonia, a chest infection. So, we're going to start you on a broad spectrum antibiotics, right? And then we're going to start you on the cough syrup, right, to treat the cough while we wait for the results of our investigations. Do you understand? OK And then since there's no history of asthma by the time you'll start treatment with the antibiotics and… and the cough syrup there will be… the breathlessness is going to reduce. But we… your... we would have checked your… your oxygen saturation and we'll see that it is fine. So, there'll be no need to place you on… on oxygen. So, you're going to have you do a full blood count in sputum and microscopy culture sensitivity. You're going to have you do any Erythrocyte segmentation rate and you're going to do a chest X-ray. So, let's see if it's a structural problem or a functional problem. Do you understand? OK, doctor. So doctor, do I.. Do you want to ask the question if you have any questions, Yes, I was going to ask that are you going to keep me in the hospital or do I… that… can I… can I be treated from home? Because I don't know. We, we, we are going to admit you for some time to evaluate you and because of the breathlessness you are having, right. And then we'll start you on on intravenous, intravenous… erm That's OK. That's cool. Culture and sensitivity could take about 72 hours to.. to five days before it will be ready. Do you understand? Yeah, no problem, Doctor. Thank you. No problem, Doctor. Thank you very much. I think that's fine. I will just, yeah, I'll just do the labs and wait for just for you to start the treatment. Thank you.",794.144,med-convo-nig

So sorry to hear that. When did this start? It all started 24 hours ago, Doctor. Oh, sorry about that. So, tell me what happened? How did the whole pain start? It all started when I jumped off a platform. It's very high far from the ground. When I fell, I fell on my left leg, and I twisted it while falling. That's when I felt pain.

So let's take it one after the other. So let's talk about the cough for a second. So you said you started coughing about three months ago, right? Yes, doctor. Okay, so I want to ask, the cough, do you cough like, is it barky first of all? Like when I say barky, I mean like the sound of a dog. Is it barky? No, doctor. I just cough, normal cough. Normal kind of cough. Okay. When you cough, do you cough like in multiple bouts? I mean, are you cough like cough, cough, cough and stop? Yeah, cough, cough, cough and stop. Or is it just like you cough once and you stop? I want to differentiate both of them. It just comes occasionally. It comes a lot, but it's not in bouts. It just comes and I cough when it comes. Okay. Alright then. So when you cough, do you produce anything in your throat? Yes. Do you produce anything in your throat? Yes. Initially, it was yellowish. It was thick. Thick mucus was coming out. It was yellowish. Then later I started noticing some reddish things inside. I don't know whether it is blood. Okay, you noticed some reddish things. First of all, you noticed it was yellowish. Then you noticed some reddish things inside the cough, inside the sputum, the phlegm you produce, right? Yes, it was yellowish at first. It was very thick, yellowish. And then later I started seeing reddish streaks amidst the yellow thickness, thickish sputum. And then I'm not sure. I think it is blood, but I'm not sure. Do you think it is blood, doctor? We'll find out. We'll find out. At the end of the question, we'll properly tie up. At the end of asking you the questions I'm asking you, I’ll be able to tie up what I think is wrong with you. So I'm still going to ask you some other further questions. So about the cough now, do you notice that you sweat a lot in the night? In this past three months, have you been sweating every day in the night? I've been sweating a lot. At first I thought it was the weather, but even when rain started falling, I sweat a lot, heavily sweating. Okay, okay. Then about the cough, since you said it's for three months, what have you done about it? What did you do about it? Did it stop at a point or you have been coughing back and forth for about three months? It has become very embarrassing that I've been coughing for so long. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. I said I've been coughing for quite a while, and it has become embarrassing. So I spoke with a couple of friends. I went to a pharmacy. I got some antibiotics. I got cough syrup. Nothing is working. Nothing is working. I'm even beginning to start losing appetite. I'm very weak. Doctor, I am sick. I am very sick. Okay, okay. No problem. Do you have any chest pain? When you cough, do you feel anything in your chest? Come again, doctor. I can't hear you. Do you feel any pain in your chest? Any chest pain when you cough? Yes, yes. Since this cough started? Yes, when I'm coughing, I feel pain in my chest. And even when I breathe in, when I'm trying to take a deep breath, I feel pain in my chest. Okay. Just to rule that out. No, no, I have not. No pain? No itching? Okay, no itching? You have not had any recent history of itching? No. Not like that, right? No, doctor. Okay, okay Fever? No, not really, not really. Not really. So, you said, back to what you said about the, that you have been sweating every night, so I'd like to probe down that area and ask you other questions. Have I noticed what? That you've lost weight, that you've lost weight in recent times Yes, I told you about, about a month ago, I started noticing, people started telling me that I've been losing weight and then I noticed that my clothes are becoming bigger. Okay, I was about to ask that, how do you, you notice that your clothes, your clothes that were bigger, that were like fitted on you before, they are now more loose, right? Yeah, they are now more loose. Okay, okay, cool. I just, I just feel tired and weak. Just feel tired and weak. Okay. Doctor yeah, what did you say? Doctor, I think I've been running temperature a bit though, although it's not, I can't, it's not really much, but for the past one month I think I've been, I've been some, some high temperature a bit, just very small. But, but any catarrh before that? Any, any catarrh before that? Any catarrh? difficulty in swallowing? No. None of that, right? No, no, none of that. Okay. Any, any back pain? Any back pain at all? No back pain. No back pain. No back pain. Okay. What kind of work do you do? And where do you work? What kind of work do you do? I'm a carpenter and I recently travelled, travelled for a job. I actually stay with a couple of people that I worked with on the job. Where, where, where, where did you travel to? Hmm? Where did you travel to? Did you travel out of your area, out of your country? Yes. What area? Where did you go to? I travelled, I travelled to India. India. All right. All right, cool. Yes. So, when you say.. where you travelled, you were in the midst of a lot of people. So, when, when, when that happened, was there anybody around you then that was coughing, that you noticed that was coughing? Yeah, yeah, I shared… some, some, some, about two people were coughing. I'm just trying to.. yes, there's a possibility. At the end of our conversation, when we are properly tied out what exactly is wrong with you then, we will know if it's from them. Because..but there's a possibility that you got it from people because of, because you were at close proximity to people that have been coughing for a long time. So, there's a chance that you got a cough right from them. So, if you don't mind, I would like to ask some other follow up questions. Yes, I've lost, I've lost appetite. Okay. And I want to ask about your.. back from...from earlier history. My immunization? I don't know. I don't know. I think I did all that when I was younger. Right, cool. No, none of that. I've been very fine until this cough. Okay. Come again? Are you married? Are you married? No, I live alone. I live alone. I'm not. Okay. While I'm asking, I want to ask if there's any recent, any history of like multiple sexual partners too, or sharing of sharps, something like that. Something that..in that regard. No, I don't. No, I don't. Have you been, have you been sharing sharps with anybody, like your clipper and stuff? I live alone and I have my clipper and everything to myself. Is there anybody in your family that has the same complaint, that has been coughing for..that you know, that has the same complaint of coughing for, for about this long? There is nobody. There is nobody. Anybody in your family? Anybody in your family? There is nobody. I'm even surprised myself, why I'm beginning to develop this cough. Now to ask you about some, some social questions. Doctor, I smoke. I smoke. So, you smoke, how many..? I only take alcohol occasionally. Okay. So, about this, about the smoking, how, how much of smoking, first of all, what do you smoke? Then what, what…how much of it do you smoke per day? I smoke cigarettes. I smoke cigarettes and I, I smoke about, about ten, ten sticks per day. Okay. All right. No, I don't. I don't know of any, any drug allergies. Okay. So, I would like to ask you some general questions about…just some general questions. Any headache, any neck pain, any neck stiffness, anything like that? None, none, none of that. Yes, that, that has been happening. Okay, noted. Then any abdominal pain, anything like that? No, no, no abdominal pain. Any constipation, no diarrhea, nothing like that? Nothing, nothing doctor. Okay. So, right now, so, at the end of our conversation, I've been able to have a list of what can be likely wrong with you right? But to properly diagnose, to like confirm, right? We need to do some investigations, right? The first thing we need to do is to do a..okay, before I, before I discuss that, I just want to just quickly examine you, right? So, examine your chest basically and listen to your, your lung fields, your right and left lung fields, right? Then, after we’re done with that, we’ll discuss about it like I’m discussing with you now. That, we’ll need to do some investigations. We will need to do.. first of all, we’ll need to do a fasting… a full blood count rather, full blood count, we’ll need to do an ESR. Alright? We’ll need to do… Okay? ESR is Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate. It’s usually a marker for acute inflammation in the body. Okay. So we’ll also need to do…and a most important thing, a chest x-ray. Because you said you have been having this cough for three months that has not… that has not stopped, even though you have taken… you have taken drugs, you have taken cough syrup and stuff and you’re still.. it’s still there, so we want to know what’s in your chest that is causing you to have this cough right? Okay, doctor. And based on what we are, what, based on what we think it is, there are also some other investigations. The cough that is productive, we need to do like a sputum…so that thing that you’re bringing out in your mouth, we want to.. like.. culture it, and since it's productive, right? So, we need to know, we want to know if there's, we want to know the bacterial cause of, of the cough, the underlying bacterial cause of the cough. I also want to do, what they call an AFB; acid-fast bacilli. It’s the test that we need to use to query what we feel is wrong with you, alongside the chest x-ray. Right? So when we put all this together and we come to the conclusion about what is wrong with you, that’s when we’ll now start you on medications. Right? So what it’s looking like is wrong with you is, we’re trying to query what we call tuberculosis right? Doctor, you think I have tuberculosis? Based on the history, based on the… we are trying to rule it out. My work as a doctor is to tie up your complaints, right? With my experience and my knowledge to be able to know which of them..which…what can be likely wrong with you. Then the investigations will now help us to point out definitive diagnosis, right?

OK this pain, do you feel it any other place apart from that middle of your chest, like maybe your back, your shoulder? Yes, that pain usually goes to my back when it starts. OK, if I could run this pain on a scale zero to 10, where zero is like where you don't have any pain, and 10 the worst pain of your life, what would this pain be? Doctor, the pain is usually between three and six, sometimes three, sometimes six. That's much. Sorry to hear that. I've not taken anything, Doctor. OK.

So from everything you've told me for your age and your presenting symptoms, since I can't see you, there are a few things that I think might be causing your pain. OK, that's actually what it looks like because of your habits-not eating regularly, the use of this pain relief, there are some of these pain relief that can predispose you to having intense pain. So before I get to the management, lest I forget, so next time you're having body pains or anything, please stick to paracetamol. Okay doctor. So the second thing that might be wrong could be a gallbladder stone First, you're going to do what is called H pylori test. It will give us an idea if this is ulcer or something else. Okay? Okay doctor Yeah, I would have loved you to also do an abdominal scan to make sure even if it's ulcer, it's not complicated or there are no other things causing the ulcer. OK, there are a few drugs I will want you to buy. You're going to take these drugs for about two weeks and you should be fine. OK. Please, when you get the result, I would like to see it okay? Okay Doctor. I would also love to give you an antacid like Gestid, something that will give you a fast relief okay? Yes doctor. For now, the advice I have for you is try and eat regularly. Be also mindful because you might gain weight so you don't eat indiscriminately. OK I’ll make sure to do that. And just like I said, yeah, the pain reliefs you've been taking, also try to stay off them and you can stick to paracetamol. That’s just all. Is there anything, I missed…anything you want to say? No, nothing at the moment, Doctor. Alright. So I'll wait for the results of the test then. Okay Thank you very much, I appreciate. Thank you so much. Alright. Yes. Bye Bye.

So based on what you have told me and my examination, I think you might be having a hernia. Yes, I think I've heard of it. OK, yes. so it basically just means…like…there's like a defect around your groin and some parts of your intestine pops in through there and sometimes when you lie down, it pops back in. Yes, yes. I think that makes sense. Yeah, so it's quite common. And then…and then I would most likely be referring you to the general surgeon so that you're being evaluated. Yes, yes, I'm with you. Yes, so…yeah so…so far it seems like an uncomplicated hernia because sometimes we could have complications like strangulation of the intestine that pops out through that defect. But you don't have abdominal pain or anything like that. So basically, I would just like to do some basic investigation like some blood work, like a full blood count, just to check your blood level and all. Yes, that's OK, yes, yes. But if you have any complaints like abdominal pain, vomiting before the review, please do come back to the hospital. Alright Alright, do you have any questions? No, I…I don't.

We'll just…I'll just examine you, examine your abdomen and…and so that I can come to a better conclusion of what's happening. I hope…I hope you're OK with that. I hope you're comfortable with that. Okay doctor. Alright, so now let me share what I think. so from…from all indications you are…you… although you…you…there's a…there's an active pregnancy which…did…did you tell me if you confirmed the pregnancy by yourself? did you say…did you tell me that? did you confirm it? I'm not sure if you asked but yeah I took the urine test and then I went to the hospital for a blood test. OK OK, So one of the things we would also do here is just to confirm it with a blood test again, do you understand? I've done a blood test Before, OK good. So if you are…the symptoms you're having, the symptoms of the lower abdominal pain are symptoms that can be seen in early pregnancy but when you now look at the pain you have, the peppery feeling when you're urinating, you might also be having a urinary tract infection, which is…which is…which is most also likely, do you understand? Okay Then some of the other things that can cause lower abdominal pain is maybe having fibroid coexisting with pregnancy, but that might not cause you to have a fever but this line of thought would…would influence the test I would run. I want to do a full blood count, then we'll take your sample for urinalysis and urine culture. Okay Yes, so that the abdominopelvic scan will confirm the pregnancy and it will also help us to see if there's any infection or anything, maybe fibroid or anything that might…might support what we are thinking. Do you understand? Then from there we'll treat. So the urine culture might take a few days, so the results that can be reviewed today, such as the full blood count, urinalysis and abdominal pelvic scan, we’d review, then you might have to come back in a few days for the culture, the result of the culture and sensitivity. Alright. And do you have any questions? OK, Yeah. Yes, Doctor. So I think I've gone to one hospital and they said that my blood group is B-negative. Can I check to, to be sure? Will it affect my baby? OK, no. Some of…some of the…at 14 weeks now, we would also register you for antenatal care, you understand. So ideally, because of the…my thoughts of the urinary tract infection, I wanted to resolve that first but now you're here, and there's an active pregnancy, Once we have…we are done with the abdomen pelvic scan, all of it is confirmed, we'll register you for antenatal care, and some of the other tests we’ll want to include will be your blood group, your genotype, then we’ll do some viral screening. These are tests to just be sure that the pregnancy can proceed properly, well and there's nothing to worry about. Do you understand? So we’ll do your blood group, your genotype, the viral screening, then they'll check your…they'll just do your random blood sugar, just some baseline tests so that we'll have some baseline, you understand. Okay Then we'll also commence you on some medications to support the pregnancy like vitamins, iron, calcium, and then we'll give you appointments for your antenatal visits. So I'll discuss more about this when we are reviewing the results, OK? OK. Yes, so do you have any other questions, Ma? No, doctor. Alright, so thank you. I will send you to the lab now, Okay? Alright, thank you. And have a nice day. You too, thank you. OK.",834.752,med-convo-nig

Alright. Hello, Mr. Shettima, I hope you're good today. My name is Doctor James. I'm the guest cardiologist who was invited here today to also attend to you. I hope you're fine. I’m…I'm not feeling too great. That's why I'm here. But I'm OK. Yes, I've been listening in on the conversation and I have just a few more questions to ask you and I'm sorry about your health. Erm, am I permitted to go on? Yes you are, you are. Thank you.   Alright, thank you. No, no, no, I don't feel that way. Do you feel some electric shock in your hands or legs at any point? No, no, no, no, I don't. Alright, thank you for that. Has there been any reduction in your urine output recently? Umm, no, no, it has just been the same. I can’t…I didn't notice any change. Oh Okay thank you. And have you ever felt like you were going to lose consciousness like you're going to faint or fall at any point? No, no, no, not that I can remember, can’t remember anything like that. Thank you very much No, I…I just want to get better. I don't have any questions. OK, before I go, what was the reading at the outreach when they told you your blood pressure was elevated? Uh, they told me 162 / 100. Alright, thank you. Measuring that at least twice in the space of 4 to 6 hours is when we make a diagnosis of hypertension and with your family history that's in your dad and with some of your history of…what's it called? Headache, palpitation, we uh…tend to think that you have a high blood pressure which is also called hypertension in this case, and really it's manageable. We’ll prescribe some drugs for you. But before we do most of those things, we would also want you to do some investigations. Yes, I understand. I'm following. Yes, so we would like you to do a chest x-ray, we would like you to do an ECG. We would like to also take your blood pressure again to confirm what the reading says today and then we would like to also book you for a regular appointment for the next few months, just to make sure that we are able to monitor you. We are going to place you on some drugs. We are going to start with a calcium channel blocker. This is one of the drugs used to treat hypertension. And we would also like to advise you on some lifestyle modification, um I don't know how much of alcohol you’ve had in the past or you do, but you will have to either reduce that or quit if you are…if you take alcohol. Yeah also, you have to stay away from smoking, use of tobacco. You'd also have to reduce your salt intake as much as possible. So in hypertension, what happens is that the body has a lot of salt and then it retains water and because it retains water, the heart has so much to do to pump that fluid round the body. And that is why it needs…it has to do more work, and it is the work that it has to do that increases the blood pressure. So that is why…that is why you have to reduce your salt intake as much as possible. We also have to check your lipid profile. By checking your lipid profile, we're trying to make sure that you do not have any dyslipidemia, which usually also contributes to hypertension. And with all of these tests done, as soon as you get the result back, we’ll know the next steps to take. Do you understand everything I’ve said? Hmm yes, I think I understand. I do. Thank you so much. Do you have any anything that we have not addressed today? Maybe, I was thinking I’ll also get something to help me sleep better. Or is it after I treat, I’ll begin to sleep better? Definitely we’ll help you…we would give you something to help you sleep better. Um, yes sorry I didn’t mention that. That is also common with elevated blood pressure, and it is something that we can manage. So would also give you something to help you sleep better, and we’ll see you in the clinic after your result, your test results are out. Alright, thank you. You're welcome.",825.536,med-convo-nig

OK Is it associated with vomiting? No Vomiting. OK. So, this cough, is it a continuous cough that's, you know, it interrupts your breathing when it starts? No, I don't think that has ever happened. OK, noticed. is there any mucus coming out? Is it productive? No. OK, so it's more of a dry cough? Yes, it's dry. OK. So, on an, on an average, since the cough started, how bad is it on a scale of one to 10? I'll give it, I'll give it a 7, it's really painful, yeah. So, I get chest pain when I cough. Whenever the cough comes. Cough. Yes Sorry about that.  Do you notice it If it's worse in the morning or at night or it could be at any time? It's usually worse at night. Usually, it becomes way more frequent than during the day. It happens all the time, but it becomes more frequent at night. OK. So, you said you have some chest pains, too. Yes. Is there any difficulty breathing? Yes. I find it really difficult, very difficult to breathe sometimes. And. OK, do you never notice? Has anyone ever told you maybe you whistle when you're sleeping? Has anyone ever said something like that to you? Yeah. Yes. My wife complained of that. OK, OK. So is there any fever? Do you have any temperature? No. OK, what about Catarrh? Do you have catarrh? No. No Catarrh currently, no Catarrh. Have you been in contact with anyone coughing in recent times? No. Any night sweats? Do you notice that you sweat excessively, especially at night? No… No doctor. Any weight loss? at all? Not at all. OK. So if I may ask, have you noticed maybe you sneeze a lot when perfume is around you or you smell maybe a strong scent, Have you noticed anything like that? Yes, Yes, that's correct. OK, that's OK. So, was there any recent travel? Did you travel far, maybe any dusty environment in recent times? No, no. No, OK, you… are you…Do you have any known allergies. Anything you're allergic to? Well, sometimes I don't really have strong allergies, but I noticed that whenever I inhale fumes or dust or perfumes, if someone uses a strong perfume close to me, I start to sneeze and sometimes it progresses to a cough and I I start finding it difficult to breathe. OK, I see. Is there any food you don't eat that you have allergic response to? No, no, no. Let me ask, do you have any family history of asthma? Or you’re not sure? Sorry Doctor, I, I, I I'm allergic to nuts. Nuts. Yes. okay… eat nuts… What do you notice? When I eat nuts, I notice swelling around my… around my face sometimes and then I… I notice also this rash around my arm, my face, my body generally Oh, I see. OK. So I was asking if you know any, if there's anybody in your family with history of asthma, maybe your cousin, your dad, your uncle, any issue of asthma? Well, I think my aunt does. My aunt does. OK, that is good. Are you currently on any medication? I have been having this leg pain for a while, so currently I'm on ibuprofen. OK, for the leg pain, for how long have you been using it? I've been taking it for like 5 days now. OK, so asides the cough now, has there been any, you know, whenever you're sleeping you wake up because you can't breathe well have you noticed any of that? No. OK, Any leg swelling? Leg swelling, No. Not that I've noticed, No. Are you hypertensive? No, I am not. OK. Any vomiting? Any stooling? Not at all. Great. Are you diabetic? Have I… Have I asked you that? No, you haven't. But I am not. Do you have ulcer? No, I don't. OK. Please sorry to ask, do you smoke cigarettes? No, I don't. How about alcohol, do you drink alcohol? alcohol, I don't take alcohol, doctor. OK, good. So aside ibuprofen you're taking currently for your knee pain, is there any other medication you take routinely? currently, no No. So, I've listened to your complaints and given your history of, you know, the cough which is what's at night and is a non productive cough as well. Yeah, that's correct. Reaction to, you know, strong sense like perfumes and fumes generally. And you also mentioned you have allergies to nuts. Yes. OK. And then the family history. So, your history is pointing in the direction of asthma, bronchial asthma. I don't know if you're aware of it have you heard of asthma before? I'm sure you said your auntie is asthmatic, so I'm sure you'll be familiar with asthma. 18 Yes… Yes. But, I never really thought I have it myself. Yes, it seems like, you know, it's possible to have missed it in childhood and it's a late onset asthma. And we’re starting to see the symptoms now. OK, OK. Although we could also have some other cases, but it's pointing towards, you know, asthma and then you don't smoke, right? No, I do not. And then you're an accountant, you mentioned that earlier. Yes, yes. You don't exactly have exposure to some kind of, you know, chemicals in factories because factory workers too could have such exposure. But it's tilting towards us now, although we would like to do some other tests to rule out possible possibilities to, you know, possible differentials such as, you know, COPD, which is the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, have you heard that before? yes. But what tests exactly are we talking about, Doctor? So, we're going to do a lung function test, which is…peak flowmeter of which we're going to give you something to blow it into, Ok And then we're also going to do a spirometry for you, which we're trying to confirm our diagnosis. So, like I said, you know, it's might… most likely an asthma, but you know we also have to check out the other possibilities. So, in the spirometry tests we're going to, you know, give you a bronchodilator and then we'll measure your… the ratio of the FEV over FVC volume of which if it gets better then it will confirm our diagnosis of asthma and would most likely put you on some bronchodilators and corticosteroids. But asides that, I would also want to advise you on some lifestyle changes, you know, because for someone that's asthmatic, you have to stay away from the triggers. So, I would advise that, you know, stay away from dusty environment. And I'm sorry, I forgot to mention, in the parlor, where in your sitting room do you use towels or rug? No, I do not. I do not. What's the kind of flooring there? Sorry, I didn't get that. You're flooring like the floor. Is it tiles or rug? Oh, tiles, tiles, tiles. OK, That's OK. OK, You understand? And I'm going to also write medications for you. Like, I'm sure you've seen an inhaler before. Yes. OK, good. So, I'm going to advise that wherever you're…sorry I'm going to, I'm going to have to be on an inhaler. Yes. Wow. Wow. To Prevent future attacks. And then in case of an acute attack, you can always have one in case of emergencies like that, in case you're having a poor breathing. So you're just going to pull out the inhaler and you just give about two puffs. You take a deep breath, inhale, take two puffs and then you breathe it in. Yes, I do. OK. Also, you had, like I said, most important thing is lifestyle modifications. You have to stay away from things that can trigger your asthma, extreme positions, extreme stress. Yeah, I'm with you, Doctor. OK, then just your environment generally. OK. So, we'd also want to just do some other investigations, such as the chest X-ray, just to look at the lungs. Generally, That's fine. Yes, that's fine. There's no problem. And I also run a full blood count, so just to look at your lymphocytes and your eosinophils. All right. All right. All right. Check your temperature. Check your SPO 2 levels. The vitals. Yes, I do. Can you run through? All right, so here it says that my temperature is 37°. my respiratory rate is 12 circles per minute, 97%. Spo2 is 97%, OK. Uhm, my pulse rate is 70 beats per minute, 70 beats. OK is 120/80mmHg. Your What? I didn't get that Sorry. My blood pressure. Your blood pressure. OK Is what? Yeah, 120/80 mmHg. OK. Thank you so much. OK. So, what we're going to do is we're going to run the tests like I've mentioned earlier. And pending for that time. I'll put you on some medications, like I mentioned, the Bronchodilators. Whenever the results are out, we'll know what to do from there. Would you like to ask for me anything? Well, I think I so far, I understand basically how that you've you've said. Uhm… So yes, we can just go ahead with the test and then I'll have the that you've prescribed. Thank you Mr Akeem for your time so we...",774.232,med-convo-nig

So your blood, blood pressure before this pregnancy, how's it been?  Like, has anyone ever told you that you have high blood pressure? No, nothing like… not that I have high blood pressure but my first pregnancy too, I had something similar and high blood pressure in pregnancy. OK And after pregnancy it's resolved. Yes. OK. Any chest pain currently? No, not at all? No. How about palpitations? Do you feel like your heart is beating heavily against your chest? No. How about leg swelling? ehn,..I noticed that actually in this pregnancy too. Yes, my leg has been swollen. OK. So, these symptoms are, is there anything that's making it worse or relieving the symptoms? Is there anything that relieves the headache or makes it worse? I use paracetamol, but the paracetamol is not working at all. Is the headaches there... not working. Have you done any other things so far apart from taking paracetamol? No. No. OK, so let's, let's talk about your previous pregnancies. How was the, how was it delivered your last baby? It was normal delivery. Was it a male or female? A female? Female. What was the birth weight? I gave birth to it myself. Ok it was 2.7 two point seven. Yes. OK. And then this pregnancy, how exactly was it conceived? You conceived it on your own. Was there any assistance? No, it was just me and my husband. You know, and I've done scan. I've done. So, it's actually a twin pregnancy. OK, yes. From the last scan that they did, it's safe to assume that you want to keep this pregnancy. This pregnancy is desired. oh yes, definitely. All right. Do you have any other medical conditions, say diabetes? No. No. OK, how's your menstruation been like? before this pregnancy? Any painful menstruation? Bleeding? No No… Normally at… at 14 years of age and there's not been any problem. I do my period regularly before the pregnancy. All right, so no pain during sex, No vaginal discharge for that? No at all. All right. So, you've not had any surgery in the past? No. No surgery. All right, So, if I heard you correctly… correctly, you're married. Yes? Yes, I am you live with your husband? Yes. OK. Do you drink, do you smoke? And My daughter And your daughter? Do You drink? No, I don't smoke. Erm… in this pregnancy, No. But before I got pregnant, you know once in a while like a smoke, let's say just a glass of wine, you know, red wine maybe, like twice weekly. But that was before the pregnancy. But, since I've confirmed my baby, I don't drink at all. OK Are you on any routine medications? It's just the, you know, the routine drugs you just gave us in the hospital, like pregnan care and all of those, those are the things I'm using. OK, All right. So, from your history it is highly suggestive that you have preeclampsia. I don't know if you… you were told in your previous pregnancy of this condition but it's similar to what happened in the previous pregnancy. Sometimes you're during pregnancy the BP gets high, and it's caused by the pregnancy actually and then after delivery it's resolves. So, at this gestational age, 30 weeks, it's advisable that we start to place you on some medications to control this, the…  the rising BP, because we wouldn't want you to have complications of preeclampsia and complications will definitely involve seizure, yes. And we don't want that to happen. So it's advisable that we place you on blood pressure medications to reduce your blood, blood pressure and then we also want to put you on magnesium sulfates. But before we do any of that, we'd like to send you send you for some tests, send you to the lab to do some tests, and then want to recheck your blood pressure and keep monitoring them. But the test we'd like you to be on, we want you to do a full blood count, electrolytes, urea and creatinine and then uric acid. We'd also want you to do a liver function test, cause your liver may also be affected. That could be a complication of the condition also. So, we want you to do all of that and then we'd like you to have a repeat scan so that we can know how correctly your baby was placed. Then, it's very important that you do a urinalysis. Also want to see how much protein you have in your urine and that would severely influence our management. So, after doing that, I would like to start you on some medications. Magnesium sulphate, I don't know if you are familiar, you must have had that in your previous pregnancy. We want to put you on magnesium sulphate to prevent you from having any feet or seizures, right And then like I said, we'd put you on blood pressure medications also. So we just to we hope that you'll be fine and we'll be able to continue this pregnancy. We'd also want to give you some steroids so that's your baby's lungs, can develop faster should in case we have to deliver your child. However, you should know that this condition puts you at the risk of having a Cesarean section 'cause if, if in any case you are not able to control your blood pressure properly, It is very important that we deliver you of this child. So, we'll put you on the steroids. So that's per adventure we have to deliver your child before term. I'm aware, I'm sure you must be aware that the term is 37 weeks, and you are 37. You are 30 weeks currently. So, in case we can't get you to 37 weeks fully, we want your child's lung to have matured enough and that will be the reason for putting you on steroids. Are you following me, Ma? Hello, Ma. Can you hear me ma? Hello. All right, so if you have any questions, please let me know. Not at all, Doctor. Not at all, All right. I think that will be the end.",640.297,med-convo-nig

The normal kind of boxers. All right, all right. So, I'm going to ask you some series of questions just to rule out other conditions that might be causing what I think you are dealing with. All right. So, have you noticed any neck swelling recently? No. Do you notice whether you shake? Do you notice whether you've been having tremors? No, not at all. OK Do you notice whether you feel erm… any history of erm… heat or told cold intolerance? No Do you notice whether you you get cold in a room where other people feel normal or it gets too hot in a room where other people feel normal? None. Asides the, the weather has been hot lately. So, asides that, I have not noticed anything again. All right, Ma, All right, Ma. So erm, contraceptives, are you aware of contraceptives? Yes, I am. Yes. Have you been on any? No. No, I'm not. So any previous histories of termination of pregnancy, whether voluntary, or any miscarriages in the past? No, that's all. OK, so do you have any medical conditions yourself say hypertension, Diabetes. No, they've never told me I was diabetic. But I know one time when we went to do tests in my… the sugar, I cannot remember the value now but it was… they said it was on the borderline that I need to watch it. OK. So that that's suggesting that you’re pre diabetic Something like that, they said I should watch it and my sugar was on the high side that day. OK, how about your how about your family members do you know anybody who is diabetic? Yes, my mom is diabetic Your mom is diabetic. OK, All right. So how long have you been married with your husband? erm...We married for about two years now, about two years but we've been trying to have children for… ‘cause we got married maybe 2022. Yes. And you both stay together. Yes, we live together. You live together, OK. Yes. All right, all right. So, how… do you know whether he takes alcohol, does he drink me? Me or my husband? You and your husband, Both of you. Do you… Do you both drink? Yeah. When we go out once in a while you know, for partying and all of that, we used to drink. All right. So, I'll still ask you some series of other questions just to make sure we did not miss out any other important details. OK, Sir. All right. So, any cough? No. Chest pain or Breathlessness? No. No, All right. Any headaches? Any blurring of vision? No, Not at all. No visual disturbances? No. OK. So, also very important, do you lactate? Have you been having any Milky discharge? From my breast? From your breast Yes. No. No. OK. Any abdominal pain? No. Any… Any Constipation? No. Any leg swelling? Not at all. Palpitations. Palpitations, No. All right. All right. OK. So uhm, basically uhm from your history, I… the history you're giving me is highly suggestive that you have a medical condition uhm… called PCOS and that's short for polycystic ovarian syndrome. Uhm… And that's because of the… that's because of your inability to conceive and the irregular menstruation coupled with the fact that you have uhm an unusual hair distribution pattern and then your… you uhm, your fasting blood sugar like you said is uhm… suggestive that you're pre diabetic and that's associated with the condition. So we are going to uhm… send you to the lab to do some couple of tests and basically just to confirm what I'm thinking about uhm… and then to rule out other causes, other possible causes of infertility uhm.., usually another close 'cause that I think you might have would be primary ovarian failure, right? Uhm  So basically we would send you for the test just to make sure that uhm… we rule out this other condition. So the test that you'll be doing would involve a repeat of your fasting blood sugar, right. OK And possibly a 2 hours, 2 hour post pandial, So meaning that you'll take your blood sample before you eat and then two hours after you eat and then compare, right. Then we'd also want to do a hormonal profile, right? So, take your blood sample to check for some hormones that we think are in control of your ovulation. So, we'll be checking for your follicle… FSH, LH, you don't really need to worry about these terms, but basically just for you to have an idea of what we are talking about. So, we check for the hormones that control your ovulation, right? And then we'd also send you for an ultrasound scan to check your ovaries basically, which is usually the most confirmatory test that is available to us to diagnose whether or not you actually have polycystic ovarian syndrome, right. OK, Sir. Basically that would be it for the investigations and then for the treatment once the results come out and we confirm that this is the condition you have, would want to most likely place you on an oral hypoglycemic agent, Metformin, you might be familiar with that, most diabetic patients use that, so that would help in controlling the weight gain and your sensitivity to insulin, right. And then for your acne, we'd want to put you on some uhm… topical medications, mostly creams that you can apply that would uhm… reduce or curb the the the acne. So basically, Isotretinoin cream and benzoyl peroxide. So, what you do is to apply the benzoyl peroxide face wash in the morning and then uhm… use a face wash afterwards and then while use a face wash afterwards and then at night… At night… you then you go about your day as usual or you have to wear a sunscreen, that's very important. And then at night, you can use the tretinoin cream after using your face wash before you go to sleep, right. So that takes care of the acne. Do you have any other problems in particular that you might want us to talk about? Not at all, Sir. But if we do all these things, so I'll be able to get pregnant. Yes, yes. Uhm… Well, also I uhm mentioned earlier that it involves an ovulation problem. So basically, it will be advisable for us to put you on a drug, clomifene citrates. That drug would help with uhm…  ovulation because basically one of the problems you're having is that you're not sending enough eggs for fertilization. So placing you on that drug would help you with ovulation to make sure that you have enough eggs for sperm to fertilize after sexual intercourse. So we place you on that drug, and then hopefully, you should be able to get pregnant. Thank you, Sir. All right, So, do you have any questions for me or do you have any Gray areas that you might want me to clarify? Not at all, Sir All right, So I think that would be the end of the consultation for today. If you have any concerns, you can please let us know. No problem, Sir. All right You're welcome, Ma",892.4624375,med-convo-nig

P: So both like seem weak but the right more than the left.

D: OK, I see. Uhm, and does this weakness seem to get worse, or is it around the same as it was when it started?

D: OK, uh. And do you, did you do any work previously that required heavy lifting or strenuous activities regarding your back at all.

P: Um no no, nothing like that.

D: And what's your home and living situation like right now?

P: I live at home with two of my children.

D: OK. And are you able to do things at home that you were before look like, or do you need some extra help from it, your family members, or extra help from other workers. Anything like that?

P: Yeah, my family's definitely been helping me out a lot over these past few weeks because. Yeah, like I said, like I'm having some weakness in my legs. I can't move around as much because I'm in so much pain. Um and then like there are all these like bladder accidents so. Yeah, they've been helping me out with everyday things. 

D: OK, I see. And currently, do you smoke?

P: No.

D: OK, do you drink alcohol? 

P: No.

D: And any recreational drugs like marijuana?

P: No. 

D: OK. I'm just getting at you to do a few things on just just as part of the physical examination.

P: Sure.

D: Are you able to bend down or extend your back at all, or is it too painful?

P: Yeah, I can't do that. It's too painful.

D: Do you notice any kind of redness, swelling in and around your back?

P: Um not that I can tell.

D: OK, and how about if you press down on the your lower back, does it hurt? 

P: Yeah, that hurts. 

D: OK. And are you experiencing the numbness right now and in your groin area? 

P: I am.

D: Are you able to raise your legs when in a lying position with straight legs, knees not bending at all, they are able to raise without any pain?

P: No, I can't do that. It's yeah, it's too painful.

D: I see, alright, so those are all the questions I had for you so it seems. It's great, it's good that you came to the emergency Department. Do you have any questions at all?

P: No, just like how can I fix this?

D: Yeah, so based on your symptoms, it's something that's pretty urgent. It's seems like you may be having something called cauda Equina syndrome that may be caused by your back pain and that's why you're feeling that groin would be called saddle anesthesia and then the urinary incontinence. So this may be from the injury that you had with the car accident. And it may be due to some compression of what we call like compression of the nerves in the area which might be giving you some of these symptoms. So the first thing we do need to do is get an MRI of your lower back just to make sure there's nothing going on like for example, like any masses in the area or any kind of abscesses that might be. We may be worried about just to make sure. Well, just to see what's going on in there that's causing these symptoms. And then based on what we find, uh, we will, we will target like the cause of the symptoms, like for example if it's an infect infection that's causing this, you might need to be admitted and require antibiotics. If there is any masses causing it, you may require surgery. For example if it's mainly related to your back it is something that we will have to treat with with an admission so it's good that you came in here today. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

P: No, that was it. Thank you so much for your help.

D: You're welcome and will get back to you shortly.",778.4800625,us_medical
RES0068,data/final_audio/RES0068.mp3,"D: So what brings you in here today?

P: So I've had this stuffy nose for the past three days. I'm getting some yellow discharge from the nose. I can't seem to smell well. And I have had this terrible headache for the past two days as well.

D: OK, so just to kind of get a timeline, what kind of started first?

P: So first, my nose was kind of stuffy. And and then I started having this yellow discharge from the nose and then I kind of lost some of my smell. And then now my head hurts. It's not even like, it's not like a headache, it's like a facial pressure 

D: OK. And have you had any of these symptoms before?

P: No, never. 

D: OK. Alright, have you noticed...so you said like the discharge is yellow, how much of the discharge are you having like in a day?

P: Like probably enough to fill the inside of my palm.

D: OK, and have you been having any fevers or chills?

P: Uh, no,  nothing like that. I did have what they thought was a viral infection a week back. 

D: OK. And did you recover from it, like on your own?

P: Yeah, it went away on its own.

D: OK, so it was just, you just had some cold-like symptoms?

P: Yeah, that's right.

D: OK, alright, have you been coughing at all?

P: Uh, no. 

D: OK, any sore throat?

P: No.

D: Any trouble breathing?

P: No.

D: Any loss of sense of taste or smell?

P: I guess loss of smell.

D: OK, and did that come after the congestion or was it present before?

D: OK, and would you say you're still pretty congested?

P: I think so, yeah. 

D: OK. And has it been getting worse would you say? Or do you feel that it's getting better?

P: Um, I would say it's getting worse.

D: OK, and right now what would you say is the most troubling symptom for you? Is it that pressure in your face or is it the congestion?

P: It's the...it's the pressure in my face. It hurts. 

D: Yeah, have you tried any medications, over the counter medications at all?

P: I tried some nasal sprays. And like decongestions but it's not really helping. 

D: OK. And so you've tried nasal sprays? Have you tried any of those, like nasal rinses, or anything like that?

P: Yeah, and they don't seem to be helping.

D: I see, OK. Any recent contact with anyone who's been ill or any recent travel? 

P: Uh, no. 

D: OK, any nausea or vomiting? 

P: Uh, no.

D: Any fevers or chills?

P: No. 

D: Any fatigue?

P:: Yeah, I've been feeling tired.

D: OK, and how many days would you say you've been feeling tired for?

P: Uh, I would say for the past three days?

D: OK, and do you feel that, you know you're having some discharge, but do you feel that there is mucous building up and dripping down your throat or anything like that?

P: Yeah, now that you mention it, it does feel like that.

D: OK, and have you noticed at all or has someone told you that your breath might smell bad? Or have you noticed it yourself?

P: Oh gosh, I hope not, no. No one said that.

D: OK yeah, sometimes with like mucous buildup it can affect like your breath as well. So yeah, just wondering. Any chest pain at all?

P: No, no chest pain.

D: Constipation or diarrhea?

P: No.

D: Any issues with urinating?

P: No, no issues there.

D: Any changes in your sleep or appetite?

P: Well, I guess sleeping is a little bit harder now because of the pressure in my face, but other than that, no.

D: OK, is there anything that helps you at all that you've tried?  

P: Like just the positions of how I'm sleeping sometimes helps, yeah.

D: OK, so this has been going on for, just remind me again, like the last four day?

P: Yeah, the last three days, last three days.

D: OK. Do you have any other medical conditions at all that you've been diagnosed with in the past?

P: No, not that I can think of.

D: OK. Alright, so have you noticed at all any weight changes? 

P: No. 

D: OK, and have you been exposed to like fumes or dust? Or how do you have any animals or pets at home?

P: No, nothing like that.

D: OK, and do you take any medications or anything regularly?

P: Um no, I just take some multivitamins. 

D: OK, and do you know if you have any allergies?

P: I just have some, I just have some seasonal allergies.

D: OK. And do you currently smoke cigarettes? 

P: No.

D: Do you drink alcohol? 

P: I don't.

D: Any recreational drugs like marijuana?

P: Um, I'll smoke a joint or two once a week.

D: Ok, a joint or two, OK. And is that, is that just recreationally or has it been helping at all with your symptoms?

P: Uh, that's just recreationally. 

D: OK. Alright, yeah, so those are all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions at all for me?

P: Uh, no, what was like, what do you think I have?

D: Yeah, so from the symptoms that you're describing, it does seem more like sinus issues. There's a sinus behind your face and what can happen is if you get an infection, like all the the mucous and everything can build up and increase the pressure. That's the pressure you're feeling underneath your face.  It's because of a sinus infection most likely. And usually like, it's usually like a viral infection that can go away on its own. We usually ask patients to try the nasal rinses, and then some oral decongestents. Or have you tried any anti histamines?

P: No, I haven't. 

D: OK, so no antihistamines. It seems most likely that you have a sinus infection. It can be bacterial with the yellow discharge that you're having as well. So we can give you some antibiotics, so will give you some. Amoxicillin. 

P: Sure.

D: So it's only been three day since you're having these symptoms, right?  And you haven't had any high fever or anything like that? Have you measured your temperature?

P: I haven't, I haven't, no. 

D: OK.

P: I don't feel hot though.

D: OK, since it's been three days, what I'm going to do is still give you some antibiotics so Amoxicillin and then we'll see like after you finish that dose how you feel. And will set up another appointment for when we can do like a phone appointment and or clinic appointment when your doses are done. Does that sound good?

P: Yeah that sounds great. Thank you. 

D: OK, you're welcome and hopefully you feel better.

P: Thank you.

D: Take care.

P: You too.",664.9728125,us_medical

P: It you know it feels crampy.

D: OK. Um, and has there been anything that triggered the headache or or made it worse?

P: Uh, no, I wouldn't say so, no.

P: Right.

D: Do you drink alcohol?

P: I do, I'll have a glass of wine with dinner.

D: OK is this daily?

P: Um most days I would say, maybe like four or five days of the seven days of the week.

D: OK, I see. And has anybody in your family had similar symptoms in the past to what you're having or had any lung conditions in the past?

P: No, nothing like that.

D: OK, how about any heart conditions?

P: Um, my father passed away at 75 from a heart attack.

D: OK, and uh, how about any cancers in the family?

P: None that I know of.

D: OK. So I think that was, uh, all of the questions that I wanted to ask on history today. Was there anything else that you thought I was missing or that you wanted to tell me about?

P: No, I don't think so. But, uh, what do you think I have?

D: So with the acuity of your symptoms, starting with the last few days and getting worse, especially with a fever which we now have documented of 38.8 and a kind of feeling, uh, tired with aches and pains and the headache, I am concerned that you have possibly a viral infection, and one of those possibilities could be COVID-19, but also it could be the influenza. It could be something like the common cold, such as adenovirus. So certainly we will do a PCR COVID swab as well as order some general lab work to look for signs of infection, such as a CBC and a white blood cell count. But um, for now we will get those tests ordered. Did you have any questions?

P: OK yeah that sounds great. Do you think I could also have you know, meningitis or something? 'Cause I was reading online on Google and that's the first thing that came up.

D: Oh yeah, you're you're absolutely right, so, um sorry, I we will go ahead and investigate that as well and we might need to do a lumbar puncture or some blood work to look for signs of infection that might be needed to be treated with antibiotics.

P: OK, alright that sounds good, thank you.",785.2908125,us_medical

P: I do cough throughout the day, but I find it's worse in the morning.

P: I can't think of anything that triggers the cough, just worse when I get up in the morning.

P: Yeah, I would say the coughs were getting worse the last few years. Slowly though.

P: Yeah, I've been having this ongoing for the last few years.

P: Hi. So I just brought in my son he's 5. Essentially, when he, so today is Friday when he got home from school on Wednesday, he seemed fine, but he I don’t know that night he started to have a bit of like a cough. It just seemed like a little dry cough, but obviously I just wanted to keep him home, keep him safe and not like spread anything if he was sick. So he stayed at home on Thursday and he was like having a bit of a cough. Then yesterday it seemed to get a little bit worse and he was really tired, uh sorry. Today, today is Friday. He was like his cough is like getting a bit worse and I've been taking his temp the whole time and it got like a little high today, what was it? My thermometer says it was high. I'm just like trying to remember it was it was. It was like over 100 though. 

D: Oh OK. 

P: Uh, 101 or something or maybe 100.1 if. But anyways it was so I I just thought I should probably bring him in 'cause I was really worried about him and you know so he could have maybe got covid and like at school or something.

D: Yeah for sure. Um OK, so just to clarify, he's had this cough and fever for the past five five days. 

P: Mhm.

D: OK, OK so let's focus on the cough.

P: It’s Friday. Its been more like like 3 days.  Wednesday is when he came home, and then um he. And then today is Friday. So yeah, sorry. 

D: Today is Friday OK. And um. OK, yeah sure uh so. Is this cough a productive cough, or is it kind of a dry cough?

D: OK, And. He is he. He's not bringing up any sputum or blood?

P: No.

D: No OK good. OK, and does he sound wheezy at all to you?

P: No, no, not that I've noticed.

D: OK, how about short of breath?

P: Um I don't think so like he usually he's a really active kid and he has. He hasn't been running a lot outside in the past couple of days, so maybe he maybe he could have been having a harder time breathing. But also I think he's just been tired in general.

D: OK, yeah. OK, Uhm. Is his coughing getting worse with certain times of the day? Like is it worse at night, in the morning?

P: Mm I think it kinda just there the whole day.

D: OK, and it does it, how does it sound? Does this sound like a barky cough? Does it sound? Uhm? Like harsh, what is what would you say the quality of it, of the sound of the cough is?

P: Uh, I, just sounds kind of dry. It's not like super loud. 

D: OK. OK, and has he ever experienced anything like this in the past?

P: Um like he's had colds before, but I haven't like. I haven't like you this time he kind of had the fever, which is different than you know, having a regular cold. 

D: OK. And are his symptoms getting worse?

P: I think so 'cause yeah, the first day he just seemed like a little dry and then yesterday is coughing and today he actually has a fever.

D: OK, and is he complaining of anything like chest pain? Or feeling like his heart's racing?

P: No, I don't think so. 

D: No, OK. Does he have a sore throat?

P: Mm I don't think so.

D: OK, and is he having any issues swallowing food or fluids? 

P: I don't know if he's having trouble swallowing, but he doesn't seem to have a big appetite right now.

D: OK, and is he, does he have a blocked nose or runny nose?

P: Maybe a bit of like a look at runny nose.

D: OK, and does he have any issues with smell or taste?

P: He, this morning he really seemed like he wasn't like into his breakfast and I wonder if he's losing his sense of taste a little bit.

D: OK, how about vision or hearing?

P: I think those are fine. 

D: OK, and is he complaining of any chills or night sweats?

P: No. 

D: OK, any changes in his hair, nails or skin like rashes? 

P: No, I haven't noticed anything like that.

D: Any changes in his bowel movements. Pardon? 

P: Um sorry no changes.

P: No 

D: OK, any nausea or vomiting?

P: No. 

D: OK, any changes in his urine?

P: I haven’t really been looking, but I don't think so.

D: Any dizziness or fainting spells?

P: No, just like fatigue.

D: OK, any confusion or memory loss?

P: No. 

D: And is he and is he an otherwise healthy child?

P: Yeah, actually he hasn't decided to like a vaccine that he hasn't had to go to the doctor like ever like. I mean, he broke his arm once, but that was it.

D: OK, um so no past illnesses and I guess no hospitalizations or surgeries except for the broken arm.

P: Exactly, like nothing. 

D: OK, and were things normal with your pregnancy with him?

P: Yeah totally. 

D: OK um. And then how about as a newborn, any complications after birth?

P: No, no, like everything is things really good.

D: OK, and then did he hit all his milestones up till now? 

P: Yeah totally. 

D: OK. Any, does he have any allergies?

P: Um. No, no, I don't think so. I mean like he hasn't really taken a lot of medicine, so it's hard to say, but like nothing.

D: Is he up to date with all his immunizations?

P: Yeah. 

D: Yeah OK. And. In terms of family history, are there any lung conditions or heart conditions?

P: Uh no everyone is really healthy.

D: OK, and. And are there and who does he live with and where does he live? 

P: Um he lives with just me and my husband, and he has a little sister, like this in town here.

D: OK and, is she healthy?

P: Yeah, I think she, yeah she's healthy.

D: OK um? Any concerns for old carpets, mold, asbestos or any environmental issues like that in the home that you're in?

P: No. 

D: No, OK. Has he been around any sick contacts recently?

P: Not, not like outside of school. I like we know for sure, not outside of school, um but he goes to school right now so. Kinda hard to say. 

D: OK. 

P: But they haven't. They haven't like contacted us about anything. 

D: OK, sure. And has he traveled anywhere recently?

P: No. 

D: No OK. OK, well those are all the questions I had for you today. Were, was there anything that I missed that you wanted to chat about today?

P: I don't think so. Um, like I, I realized that I can often times like you don't really do much for kids when you know when it's just like a virus or something. But we do, I guess need to have a covid test to go back to the school, even if you know either way 'cause they want us to be able to say. It's like the other kids have had an exposure.

D: Yeah for 

P: yeah, like. Sorry, go ahead, 

D: No go ahead.

P: I’m just basically wanted to see if it was bad. I mean he doesn't receive your so scared. That's kind of what makes him in like it's gonna be a little bit.

D: Right, yeah, OK, so first thing is, first we need to do a covid swab just to make sure that he either has it or it doesn't have it and those results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. Um we do suggest because his symptoms are allowed with symptoms of covid that he isolate for 14 days and that includes from his his younger sister possible. And then if the swab comes back negative, there is a chance for false negatives. But also it could be another viral illness that's going around nowadays, and if his symptoms get worse, so if he has a really high temperature, if he has any neurological symptoms, like seizures or. If he's feeling weak, dizzy if he has any fainting spells, please do take him to the ER and. And so for now I'll just wait for those covid swaps to come back. How does that sound?

P: Yeah, sounds good.

D: OK great yeah, yeah no worries and. I I should have mentioned if it was just the cough or if he was just short of breath or something like that and he didn't have the fever, we would add other things like asthma to the list of things he could be worked up for, but um right now it sounds like it sounds like an infection.

P: OK yeah, that's good to know.

D: Alright, sounds great. Have a good day.

P: No.

D: OK and uh in the family, are there any musculoskeletal or neurological conditions?

P: Um no.

D: OK, um. And so that I that was everything I wanted to ask on history. So for the physical exam, when inspecting the knee, are you seeing any joint effusions or joint swelling or ecchymosis or bruising?

P: It looks or is that a bruise, it looks red and I would say it's a little bit swollen on the medial aspect only.

D: OK, is there any muscle atrophy?

P: Um no. 

D: OK, and is there any misalignment or joint deformities?

P: No, not that I notice. 

D: OK. And alright on gait or walking, is there any limp or antalgia? 

P: Um no.

D: You're able to walk normally?

P: I am able to walk normally and it hurts, but I think I'm walking OK. 

D: OK. Uhm and next is there any changes to temperature like the joint itself feel hot?

P: No. 

D: OK and are there any areas of the joint line itself of the knee that is painful to palpation?

P: At just the medial part of it like the I guess where the ligament would be.

D: OK, so just let me OK, and, any pain over the patella?

P: No. 

D: Any pain over the tibial tuberosity or patellar tendon?

P: No.

D: Any pain over your over the fibular head or the lateral part of the knee?

P: No.

D: Any pain in the calf or the thigh muscles?

P: No.

D: Any pain in the hamstring muscles?

P: No.

D: OK, and is there any pain to a like varus stress of the knee?

P: To the varus stress? I guess it would be, there will be pain if I press down in that area.

D: OK, and is there any joint yeah, the joint laxity or pain too, like a valgus stress of the knee?

P: Yeah, so when I press when I do that it hurts on the medial aspect but not the lateral aspect. 

D: OK. Uhm and does it feel is as though there's some like the joints opening more when you put the valgus stress? 

P: A little bit, yes.

D: OK. Uhm and is there any instability moving the tibia anteriorly, if you're like, pull it outwards?

P: Um no.

D: And how about if you pull the tibia posteriorly, any instability?

P: No. 

D: OK, um and the is their full range of motion of the knee?

P: Yes.

D: And full range of motion of the hip and ankle?

P: Yes. 

D: OK, um and do you have any like numbness, tingling or muscle weakness? 

P: No.

D: OK, and any sensory changes to the skin?

P: No, no.

D: OK and reflexes are normal. 

P: Mmmm

D: OK. So I think that was everything I wanted to ask and and kind of go through on the physical exam. Did you have any other questions or anything that maybe I forgot to mention today?

P: Ah no, that was it. Just what can I do about my my knee?

D: Yeah, so right now it's sounding like this could be an MCL or medial collateral ligament strain, or injury and so these types of injuries are usually treated conservatively, like with things like NSAIDs or anti-inflammatories to help that pain and swelling. If the pain depending on how severe it is, it might be useful to use maybe crutches for a day or two to try to help let the pain to subside and allow you to be able to do some physical therapy exercises like strengthening the quadriceps and hamstring muscles. 

P: OK.

D: But typically injuries that are lower grade will heal within two weeks and so if it's more more severe, it could take a bit longer. And although that it's most likely an MCL injury that you're describing, it could be a medial meniscal injury as well or possibly even a bursitis at the medial aspect of the knee. But the treatment to start with would be the same and maybe we will get any x-ray if things aren't improving.

P: OK, that sounds good, thank you.",874.216,us_medical

D: OK. Um OK, so those were all the questions I had. Um do you have any questions?

P: Uh, no, I just uh yeah just wanted to figure out what's going on with this cough.

D: OK, yeah, so it seems like the symptoms have been going on for a few months now. It seems that she gets them on exertion and um they're worsened by exertion. Um at this age, one thing that definitely we want to check is if she has asthma. Um she does have some other symptoms that um are associated with asthma, like it seems that she gets um, some irritation through environmental factors as well. So what we'll do uh for her is get something called a pulmonary function test for her to see, that'll test if she in fact has asthma or not, and then based on that we will uh see if she needs any puffers. Um that can help relieve some of her symptoms. Uh and lastly, since she's having a cough, we'll also do a like a Covid test just in case as well.

P: OK, yeah that that sounds good. Thank you.

D: Yeah, and no worries, and then we'll also do like a full physical examination.

D: Yeah for sure. We will definitely um, take a swab from you today and we'll see um, what the results are. You should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours, but in the meantime you should self isolate for 14 days um, and if it's not COVID, if that comes back negative, and um yeah, some of your symptoms also sound like other typical viral symptoms, so you could have one of the common strains that's going around this time of year. So for that just, it's um, you should just um, do some supportive care, you know, staying hydrated, eating well. And if your symptoms become worse, uh, you're running a really high fever, you have any neurological symptoms like weakness or seizures, then you should seek help from the ER. How does that sound?

P: No.

D: No?

P: I was, I guess I was just worried about the cough um, it's just, I was worried that it could be COVID.

D: Yeah, so definitely right now, any of these symptoms, like COVID can have a lot of different symptoms um, so we should definitely make sure that we, to check if you have COVID or not and we'll get a COVID swab test done for you today, and the results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. Uh, and in that time, you will need to isolate even in your own home. Try to wear a mask around your family members, um, trying to eat separately and use all those methods, and, and then after the test comes back you may, you'll be contacted by public health if it's positive and kind of given more instruction on what to do. And it doesn't necessarily have to be COVID either, it can be just another virus uh, like it can be just your common cold that's been going on. So it does seem that your symptoms have gotten better. Oftentimes uh, a cough can be the last thing to go, it can take up to two weeks or more for the cough to get relieved, but it seems that you're not having any systemic symptoms like no fevers or anything else right now, so it's, it's uh, that's, that's pretty good.

D: OK, and any new carpets or any dust running or mold or anything like that in the house?

P: That there is a carpet and in the basement that, he uses that as his playroom, sometimes 

D: OK. OK. Yeah, so those are all the questions I had. Do you have any questions at all?

P: Yeah, I was just wondering like if this could be maybe asthma as well?

D: Yeah, so definitely. That's something that's at the top of our head right now, especially due to his age and the symptoms that he's been having after exertion in particular. And the family history of asthma as well. So definitely that's something that we want to investigate. So what we'll do for him is first, we'll do like a full physical examination. Listen to his alongs. And just assess his breathing and then afterwards we will order some tests for him, so he's six years old, right?

P: He is yes.


D: OK, so we'll see if we can do something called a pulmonary function test. Sometimes it depends on the child 
if they're able to follow instructions, and so that test requires a completely breathing out and following some instructions during the test. So since he's six, he might be able to do that. We we can try that. And then afterwards we'll see if he requires anything like an allergy testing or we will we might need to help manage his symptoms with a puffer, for example, like Ventilin and an  inhaled Cortico steroid, but those are just some discussions will have in the near future after we've done all these investigations.

P: OK. 

D: Well, you will be in the hospital, so yes you do.

P: I think so. I'm just uh, waiting to follow up with my family doctor about that.

D: Okay, well that, that's a good idea for sure. So it's great that you have a plan for that, um, for that. Yeah, it can be really helpful for preventing cervical cancer, as, as I'm sure you'll talk to the, with the family doctor about. Yeah, and have you had any hospitalizations or any surgeries?

P: Uh no.

D: Okay, um, where about are you living right now, and who are living with?

P: I live uh, with my parents um, and my two younger siblings. We live in a house.

D: Has anybody else been sick or have similar symptoms?

P: Uh no, no one at home's been sick.

D: Okay, and uh, how about anybody at school or, or work, or anything like that that you've been around who's been sick?

P: So one of my friends actually had like a runny nose and a cough as well a couple of days ago, but uh, she seems to be better now and her voice is okay. 

D: Okay, and um, have you traveled anywhere outside of the city or province?

P: No, no, not recently.

D: Okay um, and then, um, anybody in the family uh, have any heart or lung conditions? 

P: Heart or lung? I know, um, like, heart disease, runs on my father's side of the family. I'm not really sure like exactly what, what kind of diseases though.

D: Okay, um, and I, sometimes people that, kind of in this age group, might experience with either drugs or alcohol. Have any of your friends done that or, or yourself?

P: I know like some of my friends have uh, tried alcohol and try marijuana, but I haven't experimented yet.

D: Okay, that's good and um, I, that's all I wanted to ask today on history. Was there anything else that you wanted to add?

P: Oh, nothing that I want to add. I just, what do you, how do you think I can make this, make my voice better? And how long will I have, have this horse voice?

D: Yeah, so uh, right now it's sounding like um, a viral type illness where there's inflammation of the vocal cords, uh, with having the cough and the runny nose a couple of days ago. Actually, this reminds me that. Have you, I'm not sure if I asked about fevers or chills, if you have any?

P: Uh no, I haven't.

D: Okay, um, and so for, if it is a viral infection then, um, it's just supportive kind of management. So that will mean trying to stay as hydrated as you possibly can over these next um, next few days and then also you can use things like, if they help, like lozenges or something along those lines. Um, but it will, it will just take some time for it to come back on its own, a few days to a couple of weeks sometimes. And the cough could possibly last for um, two to four weeks after um, after having a viral type illness.

P: Okay.

D: Yeah, so it could be quite a few weeks that the symptoms last for. But since you're having a cough, and these symptoms could overlap with COVID we'll want to get a COVID swab today as well um, and kind of go from there.

P: Okay. Okay, that sounds good, thank you.",665.2296875,us_medical

P: I do have some chest pressure for sure. I just feels like I can't, can't ah, catch my breath.

D: OK, so is it mostly related to your breathing or do you have it at rest? Or do you have it with any exertion?

P: Yeah, I think it, it's there kind of most of the time, like the chest pressure. I kind of feel it throughout my chest when when I'm breathing but, but also just kind of sitting here I can kind of feel it.

D: OK I see. And are all of your symptoms constant? Or do they come and go?

P: They've been constant and they've got been getting worse since since last night.

P: No, I was told I didn't need any any yet, but if I didn't quit smoking I might in the future. 

D: OK, and are you using any kind of puffers at all?

P: Yeah, I I do I I use I think it's called like Spiriva or something like that. I use that every day and there's another one that I'll use like if my symptoms are getting bad. My blue one. I did try that actually last night and it didn't, it helped a little bit, but, not not enough.

D: OK, so have you just tried like tried it one time last night? Have you tried it after that?

P: Yeah, we just tried it last night.

D: OK, so nothing today right?

P: No, I just had that, had that happen, the one time, last year.

D: OK. And do you feel that your symptoms are similar, worse, or how do they compare to last time, if you remember?

P: Pretty similar. I think last time I was worse, but I waited longer last time and so that's why I was concerned and and wanted to come in early.

D: OK. OK, uh, alright, so uh, have you had any fevers at all or chills?

P: Yeah, I've I've had some chills last night like I just couldn't get warm. I was loading up on blankets and it didn't seem to help.

P: Uh, not necessarily it, just it just harder to to, feel like I can't catch my breath.

D: OK, do you feel fatigued at all?

P: Ah yeah, I I have a, I mean I have been feeling just tired this morning, but I think that's more to do with the fact that I just can't really do a whole lot of exertion because as soon as I move around I'm, I can't breathe.

D: I see. Uhm OK, and are you having any kind of diarrhea, constipation, or any urinary troubles at all?

P: Um she didn't have any like complications during the pregnancy. Uh they did have to, um I forgot what it's called, but uh he was like a difficult baby coming out. Um and he was at term though, he wasn't premature, but they had to use just um some tools to get him out.

D: OK, OK. Um so it was a vaginal delivery, but they used some tools like forceps maybe or vacuum?

P: Yeah, yeah it was forceps, yeah.

D: OK, OK. Um and he's, you mentioned he was full term?

P: Yeah, he was born at uh 40 weeks.

D: OK, perfect. Did he need to be hospitalized for any reason after that?

P: No, he wasn't hospitalized. Uh we stayed there maybe one day extra just because um there was some just kind of misshaping of his head.

D: OK.

P: That kind of went away. 

D: OK, OK, good. And is he on any medications? 

P: Uh no, no medications.

D: No medications, up to date with his immunizations?

P: Yeah, he's all up to date.

D: OK, any allergies?

P: Um not that we know of.

D: OK, how about family history of lung conditions, heart conditions?

P: Um no, we've been pretty healthy as parents. Um and I think my my father has like high blood pressure, diabetes, and all those types of things.

D: OK, OK, any um ear issues like congenital ear, sorry um, genetic hearing issues or ear issues? 

P: No, nothing like that.

D: OK, um does anyone at home smoke?

P: No, no one smokes.

D: OK. Um and who does he live with?

P: So he lives with um me, his father, and his mother as well. 

D: OK. Uhm, any siblings?

P: No siblings, he's an only child.

D: OK, and how are things at home, um is like, are things financially stable? Any relationship issues?

P: No, we've been pretty uh fortunate like it it's, no financial issues uh and we have a lot of support from our parents as well. Uh the relationship is great, so no, no issues.

D: OK, good good. Um has he had any sick contacts recently?

P: Um I don't think so. He's, we've been at home so I don't know. We we did have like, with our with my brother's uh kids like uh they came to see us once um but that was like, that was, I think at like three weeks ago.

D: OK, OK, three weeks ago. Alright, um travel to anywhere recently?

P: No.

D: No, OK. Alright, those were all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions that you wanted to ask me today before we end the interview?

P: Uh no, not really. Just wanted to know if, like I remember he did need antibiotics before so I was just wondering if he needs them now.

D: Yeah, um so, well first, because some of his symptoms overlap with Covid, like the fever especially, we'll do a swab on him anyways um and you should hear those results in about 24 to 48 hours. Um and then it, this picture sounds like acute otitis media, so like an ear infection. And um it's especially likely because he's had them in the past, so I'm gonna have to take a look into his ears first before like um coming up with a management plan. But I'll kind of walk you through what we look at. So if I take a look and I see like a perforated tympanic membrane with like pus, we'd prescribe like 10 days of um antibiotics. If he has some like middle ear effusion, so like some fluids with like a bulging tympanic membrane and he appears to be really ill, uh which from the sounds of it, he sounds ill, he's had this fever for more than two days, we'll also prescribe antibiotics for 10 days. And then, if it's just some middle ear effusion, so just that clear fluid um or just the bulging tympanic membrane, we can just um reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see how he's doing. And if he's worse, again, we'll prescribing prescribe him some antibiotics. Um the antibiotics that we usually prescribe are amoxicillin, and because he doesn't have a penicillin allergy, that should work.

P: OK.

D: Yeah, how does that sound?

P: That sounds good. Thank you so much.

D: OK, great, thank you.",711.765625,us_medical
RES0014,data/final_audio/RES0014.mp3,"D: What brings you in today?

P: This afternoon, I'm just here because I've been experiencing some breathlessness as well as a bit of cough.

D: OK, when did it start?

P: So I think it's a it started around three months ago and I believe it's just been getting worse.

D: OK. Um, how often are you experiencing the shortness of breath?

P: I feel it like a lot of the time, especially outside when I'm in the cold or at at night when I go outside at night, my chest feels a little tight too at the same time.

D: OK, and how long does it last?

P: I would say it lasts up to an hour every time I'm out in the cold and then once I come back in. So I'd say it lasts at least one hour. 

D: OK, does anything else make it worse, like dust? You know, laying down anything like that? 

P: Sometimes when I'm near dust, sometimes when I'm running during gym class, increased activity does make it worse. 

D: OK, OK. And if you were to describe the quality of your breathing difficulties, is it more like a burning kind of feeling? Is it like you can't catch your breath? What does it feel like?

P: I think it's more just a I can't catch my breath and it feels like my my throat is just kind of like closing off and I can't take deep breaths.

D: OK, yeah, that's scary. And one to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is your shortness of breath?

P: It can get up to I would say like an 8 at times. It can get pretty scary. And sometimes, like I feel like heaviness in my chest too when it happens. 

D: Yeah, and the coughing, has it been going on for as long as your breathlessness?

P: I would say around the same same time frame like 3 months, but I'm not always coughing. It comes and goes. 

D: OK, and for your coughing, is it kind of like the same triggers, the cold, dust, things like that? 

P: Yeah, I would say so.

D: And do you ever have do you ever cough up blood?

P: No, I don't. It's mostly just a dry cough. I don't cough up anything. 

D: OK so no sputum or phlegm, no? OK, do you ever feel wheezy?

P: I I I do hear like a like a weird sound when I breathe out sometimes, I I think it might be wheeziness.

D: OK, OK. Do you have a sore throat?

P: Uh, no I don't have a sore throat, no. 

D: No? Um, how about a runny nose or stuffy nose?

P: No, nothing like that.

D: OK, so you woke up feeling chilly, any night sweats? 

P: Uh no.

D: OK and any chest pain at all?

P: No, just sometimes when I I'm coughing a lot I feel a little bit of just tension and heaviness in there. But that's just when I'm like really coughing a lot. 

D: Yeah OK, and any any feelings like your heart's racing?

P: Nope.

D: No? OK. And how about swelling? Have you noticed swelling anywhere in your body?

P: No, nothing like that. 

D: No? OK um, OK, how about um, does your shortness of breath get worse when you're falling asleep?

P: No, nothing like that. I think it's mainly just worse if I go out in the cold or I'm like running around, doing more activities. 

D: Does it ever wake you up at night?

P: No never. 

D: OK and any nausea or vomiting?

P: No, no nausea or vomitting.

D: Confusion, memory loss?

P: No, nothing like that. 

D: OK, good are you otherwise healthy?

P: Yeah, I don't have any other condition, I I do remember my doctors saying I have hay fever before, but that's about it.

D: When was that? 

P: I think that was like more than three years ago.

D: OK, um, any recent surgeries?

P: No. 

D: No? Are you on any medications?

P: I just take some Tylenol sometimes for the like Tylenol cold, sometimes for the symptoms. I don't think it has really helped.

D: No? OK, do you have any allergies? Not just to medications, but to anything else?

P: Uh just like hay fever but nothing, nothing else that I can think of, no.

D: OK. Um, are you up to date with all your immunizations?

P: As far as I know, yeah everything's up to date.

D: OK, any family history of lung conditions?

P: Uh, don't think so. My sister, I think she they were saying she might have asthma and she also has eczema. No one else in the family has any other conditions. 

D: Not not even like heart conditions, cancer?

P: No, uh no, not that I know. 

D: OK, OK, have you been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently? 

P: No.

D: No, OK, and any travel recently?

P: No, I've been here in Ontario. 

D: OK, and where do you live?

P: So I currently live in London, but I just recently moved into a new flat around two months ago.

D: Two months ago, OK. Um, is it more is it an older flat?

P: Uh, no, it's fairly new. But one thing I did notice, I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but my flatmate actually smokes. Sometimes that can really irritate and make me cough more sometimes at night. 

D: Yeah, any any pets?

P: Oh no, I don't have any pets.

D: OK and and do you smoke?

P: No, I don't smoke, no.

D: OK. And do you smoke marijuana?

P: No, I don't smoke marijuana or cigarettes.

D: OK, how about alcohol? Do you drink alcohol?

P: Um, just like, maybe sometimes at parties, but very rarely. Maybe I would say once a month.

D: OK, OK. Um, and is there anything that you wanted to discuss today that I missed?

P: Uh, so no, I think that that was all like just the shortness of breath was scaring me a lot. But yeah, just the coughing, but other than that I just want to know what's going on. 

D: OK, yeah, and you mentioned you are otherwise healthy so you don't have any history of asthma or anything like that, right? 

P: No, no ones ever told me that, but my sister has asthma, so I was wondering, maybe? 

D: Um, have you ever experienced shortness of breath when you were younger with like exercise?

P: Uh, not really. Just maybe like the normal amount. Like if I'm running around too much, I feel shortness of breath, but I think it just got worse over the last few months. 

D: OK and then have you ever had any imaging done in the past like a chest X-Ray or investigations like a pulmonary function test?

P: No, I don't recall having any of that done. 

D: OK alright well those are all the questions I had for you. If you didn't have anything else to add, I guess we will conclude by saying that what you have, we have a differential diagnosis for this. Um, it sounds like what you have is asthma. Since your symptoms started three months ago when you moved into a flat with your friends, and it seems like this smoking and cold is triggering that and so we'll work you up with a pulmonary function test to start and we'll see if bronchodilators will help with your symptoms. And if it doesn't, we'll also rule out other things like pneumonia or like allergic rhinitis. How does that sound?

P: Yeah, that sounds good. 

D: OK, sounds great. Well, we'll see you soon then.

P: Alright, thank you.

D: Take care.

P: No, that was, uh, about it I was uh I was wondering if you think I I have an infection or is this uh COPD acting up, or what's going on?

D: Yeah, so definitely with your history of COPD and um these symptoms, it can just be an exacerbation of your COPD and that can happen sometimes when you have COPD and then you get a either viral or bacterial infection and that makes your symptoms worse, and you've also had a fever, so we'll do like a full physical examination, get your vitals, everything, but uh and then we'll give you some uh like nebulized like um for your home puffers too, but all just in the hospital and monitor your response to them. Uh and then we'll also get like your, some of your blood work and chest X-ray just to see if there's any like pneumonia. And lastly we'll just get like a Covid swab done since some of these symptoms also overlap with Covid symptoms. Um and yeah so we'll, so that's what we'll do um and I'll let the emergency department know that you're on your way. I think you'll need to get all those tests there, and then they'll decide whether or not you need any kind of admission or you can just go home on antibiotics um from there, OK?

D: Well, it is sounding like it could be most likely an infectious type of process going on with the possibility of having a fever with a cough and sore throat. So we'll do a physical exam and also some investigations which will include a covid test today. Because some of these symptoms do overlap, but it could be something like the common cold. I don't know the virus that's bringing this on but it's not necessarily covid. But because we're doing the test, it will require 14 days of self isolation. We'll get back to you with the results as quickly as we can.

P: So I so I have COPD and it's usually like pretty manageable with my puffers and that. But just in the last like 3 days I feel like it's gotten a lot worse. You know, I, I feel like I'm coughing more often and I'm now, uh, kind of producing more sputum. Kind of like a green yellowy sputum uhm. I even notice that there is like a little bit of blood a couple times when I was like, really coughing hard. I’ve been finding it like harder to breathe than usual. I don’t have home oxygen or anything, and I'm not. I didn't think I was quite there yet, but this these last few days it's been. It's been really hard to breathe. 

D: I see OK, so this is happened in the past three days. Have your symptoms gotten better or worse over this time?

P: I feel like they've been get maybe maybe getting a little worse. They definitely haven't gotten better, 

D: OK, and has this ever happened to you before?

P: I’ve had I had some troubles like when I've been sick before where the cough is gotten pretty bad. This is probably this is probably the worst that I've had, but I have like I have had in my COPD been made worse by being sick.

D: I see OK. Well, I guess the first thing we're going. So how's tbad, how bad is your shortness of breath?

P: Like I I walked here fine, but I normally like can walk around the block and I go for a walk, usually a couple times a day to walk my dog and it's been just it's been a little bit trickier to do that.

D: I see OK. And uh have you ever had any hospitalizations in the past specifically for COPD exacerbations?

P: Um I haven't. Uhm, like stayed over in the hospital. I like come to emerge a couple times.

D: Alright um. How many times?

P: I think twice maybe over the last like three years.

D: Sure. And. Have you had any other symptoms? So have you had like a runny nose or stuffy nose? Any pain in your sinus?

P: Um. Let me think I I meet my I meet a couple of friends to walk our dogs together outside and one of them was a bit sick for a bit. We try not to get too close, but maybe I don't know. Maybe sometimes we walk a little too close. We feel too safe 'cause we're like outside. 

D: OK, OK um. And did your friend get a covid test done?

P: Uhm? I don’t know.

D: That's OK. OK, and you mentioned that you had COPD that was diagnosed four or five years ago. Any other medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?

P: Um. Yeah I have a high blood pressure.

D: OK, and are you taking any medications?

P: I’m not, I'm not I we talked about it, but I decided to try to change my lifestyle as much as I could 1st and I've also done that for the COPD. It's generally pretty like I've been really trying to take care of it, but um I feel like I maybe got sick or something this time, yeah, so my blood pressure is like OK right now.

D: OK, OK.

P: My pressure and then I lost weight and started this walking more.

D: That's great. That's really, really good that you're taking better care of yourself. Should definitely continue doing that.

P: Right?

D: And you've mentioned that you have some puffers. How often do you use those?

P: Oh like I have the one that I use every day. That I'm supposed to just use no matter what, and then the one that I use when kind of just when I need it. I probably use it like once every two weeks.

D: OK. OK. Uhm? And you mentioned that your COPD’s are getting better. Do you find that it's affecting your life in any way affecting the way that you're doing your daily activities at at home or at work, if you are working?

D: OK, uh, alright, well I guess one more question, are there any lung diseases or heart conditions or cancers that run in the family?

P: No, nothing that I can think of.

D: Alright, well that's those are all the questions I had for you. I will now do it physical exam and look at your vitals and listen to your chest. It's likely that what you have right now is COPD exacerbation, maybe just a like an infection that you got, which worsened some of your COPD symptoms. We would also have to rule out covid, so we'll be doing a covid swab and will decide based on the on your labs in your vital signs. It's instead of other things whether you need to stay in the ER and be admitted, or if you are good to go home, I will also talk to my attending and will make those decisions together and come back and talk to you. Does that sound good to you?

P: Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.

RES0188,data/final_audio/RES0188.mp3,"D: What brings you in?

P: Hi, I was just really worried. My son just yesterday night I noticed that he was making these grunting noises and I did notice that he was a bit warm yesterday as well, and today I, he just hasn't been himself, just very, very irritable, crying a lot. Yeah, I just got bit worried.

D: Yeah, for sure. What started first?

P: I would say the there was a little bit of coughing earlier, like yesterday. But then later on during the night, it kind of turned into this grunting noise, and he's kind of like his chest is moving a lot more when he's taking a breath in and all that.

D: OK. Uhm did you measure his temperature at home?

P: Yeah, so I think it was 38.5 degrees Celsius.

D: OK, and did you do that orally or rectal or under armpit?

P: I did it under the armpit. 

D: OK. OK, uhm so you mentioned that he's had a fever, he's been grunting and he just seems a little bit more fussy. Is that right?

P: Yeah.

D: OK is he coughing at all?

P: He was yesterday but not really now. 

D: OK and was it a dry cough? 

P: I think so. I mean, not-nothing really came out.

D: OK, that's good. So no blood, no sputum?

P: No. 

D: OK, and did he seem wheezy?

P: Uh, no. 

D: No, OK. So there's no wheezing with the grunting?

P: Maybe a little bit like that, just a little bit of a noise, but it's mostly the grunting. 

D: OK. Has he had any weight loss?

P: No, not that I really, we haven't really weighed him now since his last appointment. 

D: OK. Does he seem excessively tired or fatigued?

P: Uhm, moreso today I would say he's like earlier, he was very fussy, but now he seems a bit more tired.

D: OK. Any rashes that you've noticed?

P: No.

D: No, OK. Uhm any changes in his vision or hearing?

P: Uh, no, not that I can tell.

D: No, OK. So he's responding to like sounds and he's still looking at you and things like that?

P: Yeah.

D: OK. Have you noticed a runny nose or stuffy nose?

P: Uhm, no, nothing like that.

D: No, OK. And he said he hasn't had any like fainting spells?

P: Uh, no, I don't think so.

D: No, OK. And how many wet diapers is he producing in a day now? 

P: Probably 5 or 6.

D: 5 or 6 OK. Has that changed from before?

P: No, it's pretty much the same.

D: OK, and uhm any changes to his bowel movements?

P: No.

D: No. How about his urine?

P: No.

D: No, OK. OK. And then you said he was fussy, is he still eating and drinking OK?

P: Uh no, today he's not really taking anything in, like very fussy, very hard to feed him today.

D: OK, is he crying a lot?

P: Earlier today was crying a lot, but now has calm down and just I guess tired himself out.

D: Yeah, OK. Alright, and is he an otherwise healthy child?

P: Yeah he was, he was premature by three weeks so, Other than that like I remember when he was born they did have earlier some issues with his oxygen not being high enough and they had to like keeping, keep us in the hospital for a bit longer.

D: OK.

P: But yeah, after that, like there haven't really been too many concerns.

D: OK, so he's hitting all the developmental milestones like in terms of motor movements, ah speech, behaviour, all of that?

P: Yeah, no issues there so far.

D: OK, and how about medications? Is he on any?

P: No.

D: No medications, OK. And is up to date with all his immunizations?

P: Yeah, oh he had all his immunizations so far. 

D: OK. How about allergies? Does he have any?

P: Not that I know of. 

D: No, OK. Any family history of lung or heart conditions?

P: No.

D: OK, and does anyone at home smoke?

P: No, no one smokes. 

D: OK. Has he been in contact with anyone sick recently?

D: OK, how old is she? 

P: She's six years old.

D: Six, OK. And is she healthy or is she having similar symptoms?

P: No, she's healthy. No, no symptoms.

D: OK. Any travel recently? 

P: No. 

D: No, OK. And who does he live with at home?

P: Uh, so his older sister, me and his mother.

D: OK, any reasons to believe like you have old carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, pets, anything like that that could worsen his symptoms?

P: Uh, no nothing like that.

D: OK, so I think those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or any concerns? Anything that I missed that you wanted to add?

P: No, I think that was all.

D: OK, uhm so for him we'll do a Covid swab just to rule that out because some of his symptoms do overlap with that. But it it's really sounding like a picture of like community acquired pneumonia, so we'll do a couple of things for him. Uhm, we can get his temperature, get his oxygen oxygen saturation right away we'll get a chest x-ray. We'll do some blood work as well and uhm, he might need to be admitted depending on uhm, the oxygen, oxygen saturation and the fact that he's grunting. So if he's admitted will give him some extra oxygen and keep monitoring him and keep him hydrated. Uhm we'll also give him some antibiotics if, if it turns out he has pneumonia. Yeah, does that sound OK?

P: That sounds good. Thank you.

P: Yeah, so it's been about forty, Yeah, forty-ish years at least.

D: And have you thought of quitting at all?

P: Yeah, I've been trying. I was thinking of maybe talking about a prescription for helping quit or something like that today. I was feeling like this is causing some of my symptoms like my cough, shortness of breath.

D: Yeah, well, it's really great that you're thinking about quitting. We can definitely help you with some resources, and some medications. Have you tried anything before that I should know of, to help you quit?

P: I've tried nicotine patches and gum, but that's it. 

D: OK, so yeah, there's uh, like other options as well that you can take. Have you heard of Champix?

P: Uh, I did hear of it actually. Yeah, so one of my friends tried it and it worked well for them so, Yeah. 

D: OK, yeah, so we can, if you're wondering about that, I can give you some information on that medication, like a whole package for you and then we can discuss if that could work for you.

D: OK, sweet. And other than smoking, do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana? 

P: No, I don't.

D: OK, and do you drink alcohol?

P: Well I'll have one or two beers on the weekend.

D: OK. Alright, so yeah, that's pretty much all the questions I had right now. It seems that your symptoms, You do have that cough and the shortness of breath and it's been chronic, but now you're coughing up some blood as well, so that is definitely something that's concerning and we want to make sure there is nothing going on so we will get a chest X-ray for you and see if we can find anything there. Are still producing the bloody sputum?

P: Yeah, that's been coming up a daily still.

D: OK, so if you think you can produce that, we can even take a sample of that as well and see if there is any presence. The one thing that we are concerned about with some of your symptoms and a long history of smoking as well is lung cancer. So yeah, we will do a chest X-ray, get some cytology done as well and then once we have that in the future we may need to maybe do a biopsy but right now we'll do a few of the first things that I mentioned and then go from there.

P: That sounds good. Thank you.

D: Yeah, for sure, so that's kind of top on my list right now to rule out, so we will do a Covid swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results. In the meantime, you should isolate for for about 14 days and if your symptoms get worse, go to the ER and if you're experiencing things like weakness, seizures like, and you're not getting any better in a couple of weeks, or you feel dehydrated. Otherwise, supportive care at home, keeping yourself hydrated, eating well, sleeping well, all of those will definitely help as well. Does that sound OK?

P: OK, I'm so I have been coughing a lot over the past week or so. And it's been pretty dry, but I've been coughing like almost nonstop throughout the day, and I'm feeling very short of breath, and my bronchodilator helps, but I found I'm using it a lot now.

D: OK, how long have you know that you have asthma for?

P: I was diagnosed when I was eight. 

D: You're 10 now.

P: That's right. 

D: So you're using your bronchodilator more. This is the one that you use, kind of as needed?

P: Yeah. 

D: OK and then do you have one that you take every day no matter what?

P: Uhm? No, I don't have that one.

D: OK. You just have the one that you take is needed. Do you take any other medications?

P: Uh no I don't take anything else.

D: Just the one is it a it's a puffer? 

P: Yes. 

D: OK, and you're using it more than normal, so how often were you normally using it?

P: Um I was only using it like I don't know. Maybe once every two weeks or so. Not very often. But now I'm using it like almost everyday like five six times a week.

D: OK, any are you? Does it usually turned out that you need it like during certain times like say when you're exercising or when it's cold?

P: Um I find I use it more, both like when it when it's right after I like, run around after gym during recess. Um and yeah, the cold also makes it worse.

D: OK, any other triggers that you can think of?

P: No, no other triggers. 

D: Normally get more in certain seasons? 

P: I. I guess no, no big changes there. I find the cold air makes it worse like winter makes it worse or like. Yeah, maybe also the spring spring with like pollen and stuff like that. 

D: OK, so you have allergies too?

P: I think, so I haven't ever been like formally diagnosed. 

D: OK, I see I see. Yeah, that would make sense. No. OK, uh, so you say you've had more coughing lately, is that right? You said the last two weeks.

P: Yeah.

D: OK, so you're getting Wheezy even more times than then you're having to use your bronchodilator.

P: Yes, that's right. 

D: OK. Are you having any symptoms at night time?

We probably will do a covid swab just because of the times that we're living in right now, but I just want to ask you a few more questions before I go talk to the doctor.

P: Oh no, no no.

P: Oh I'm I like playing games online with my friends and and before covid we used to get together and have movie nights and play sports together.

D: It sounds really cool. Hopefully we can get this figured out for you so you don't have any, you don't have to use your your medications every time you play sports 'cause that's no fun. And 

P: No. 

D: You should be able to enjoy that. So, so we're going to try to get this sorted out for you. I'm gonna go talk to the doctor and tell him everything or her everything that you said and yeah we’ll come back and see you shortly, hopefully maybe all you need is a little change to your medications and maybe it will be better be able to better control your asthma.

P: Uh I just came in today I think I broke my leg or something, it's something that was, I heard a snap, I was in um just a dance class um and we have like these long uh dresses, it it was a traditional dance class and my foot uh slipped right onto, it got caught in my dress and it just kind of slipped and I I felt right on my, my leg kind of twisted and I fell down and I just stayed down. I knew something was not right and something was broken.

D: When did this happen?

P: Just uh I would say like an hour ago 

D: Hour ago, OK. Are you able to bear any weight on it at all?

P: No, not really. I I had to come in the ambulance.

D: OK, OK, and um if you were to localize this pain, where exactly is it?

P: It's pretty much my whole lower leg is painful, but I think where it looks like it broke is like the middle part of my lower leg.

D: The middle part, OK middle part of your lower leg, so kind of where your shins are?

P: Mhmm.  

D: OK, so in the shin area, OK. Um have you tried anything for it? I know it's only been an hour.

P: Uh no nothing. I just like I just want to make sure I keep it as still as possible um I didn't wanna even try anything.

D: OK yeah, that makes sense, if you were to describe this pain, would you say it's um sharp, dull, achy throbbing?

P: It's like sharp and throbbing. It's like probably one of the worst pains that I've felt in my life.

P: At 10 for sure.

D: Ten, OK, have you, so you said you've never experienced this before, um do you feel like it's getting worse, the pain, or has it been pretty much the same since it started, or is it getting better?

P: Uh I would say it's the same, it's like I'm in as much pain as I was earlier.

D: OK. OK and um so yeah, OK, um do you know how you felt like on the floor? Like did you uh go like leg first or was it, did your um, kind of like the mechanism of your fall, did you break the fall at all with your arms?

P: Uh no, I didn't break, it kind of, so I was kind of uh, I feel like when I was slipping it was at first my leg was hyper extended but it kind of just felt like it snapped and it went straight down, so there was some kind of twisting as well as some hyperextension. Um but it just kind of slipping on my dress and then just straight down.

D: OK, OK. Um otherwise, do you have any pain elsewhere in your body?

P: No.

D: How about any numbness or tingling in the area?

P: Um I do feel some numbness, tingling just below where it happened, um but it like comes and goes.

D: OK um and then how about how about any um like feelings of like losing sensation or feeling cold in that area? 

P: Um no, I I can feel everything in that area.

D: OK.

P: But it's hard to tell like it's just very painful right now.

D: OK, that's good. Um do you have any allergies?

P: No, not that I know of. 

D: OK, um and then is there any family history of like musculoskeletal issues?

P: Um so my mother has something called osteoporosis.

P: Um but that's that's all that I can think of.

D: How old was she when she was diagnosed with that?

P: Um probably in her fifties.

D: In her fifties, OK. 

P: Late fifties I would say.

D: Um have you been, have you ever like been tested for that?

P: No, I've never, I've never had testing.

D: OK, all right. Um and then any family history of lung or heart conditions?

P: No.

D: Uh how about autoimmune conditions?

P: Uh no, not that I know of.

D: Any cancers?

P: Uh, I think one of my aunts has uh ovarian cancer. 

D: OK, OK, um how old was she when she was diagnosed with that?

P: Um like pretty uh recently, so probably like in her sixties.

D: OK, OK, um and then have you been in touch with anyone sick recently?

P: No. 

D: No, OK, have you done any travel recently?

P: No. 

D: OK. Um those are all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own or anything you wanted to add before we move to the physical exam component?

P: No, I just want to get this fixed as soon as possible.

D: OK, that sounds good, yeah we'll, we'll try our best.

P: Thank you.

D: Um OK, so now looking at your legs like side by side, do you notice any uh redness or swelling in your right leg compared to your left?

P: Yeah, it's all, it's all swollen and red and just looks so much different than my other leg.

D: OK, yeah, um do you notice any obvious like breaks in the skin?

P: No, there's no breaks in the skin but like when I fell like I, I can definitely see like the bend, there is like a bend in the bone, so I definitely do think it's broken.

D: OK, and do you notice any like bony pieces that are pushing on the skin?

P: No.

D: No, OK. Uh any bruises in the area?

P: Yeah, the whole area seems bruised up and angry.

D: OK. Um does uh, besides the bruising and the misalignment, do you notice any other obvious deformities, any muscle atrophy in the area?

P: No.

D: No, OK, and then uh placing your hand on one leg compared to the other, does it seem warmer?

P: Yeah, I feel like it's it's warmer.

D: OK um and then I'm gonna try to get you to do some movements, um can you move your right leg at all, like can you flex and extend your knees?

P: No, not not at all like I I'm I'm too scared to try.

D: OK, and how about weight bearing, are you able to stand up at all on that leg?

P: No, I just I just got time to call the ambulance, I knew I knew it was just not possible.

D: OK, alright, um I guess those were all the questions that I had for you. Um I think you may have a tibial fracture. So we'll start with some X Rays um to be sure and to try to take a look at like where the fracture is and how we can approach that. Um because everything is swollen and angry down there, we'll probably try and um apply a splint um until the swelling goes down. And then um we can uh refer you to an orthopaedic surgeon for a surgic, for the surgery itself. So that could um involve, like uh  you know them doing like and intramedullary nail, plates and screws, and um like some sort of fixation. Um but after the surgery, your fracture will probably take about four to six months to heal completely, uh so in that period um we can talk about like pain management and physiotherapy as well, just to keep the muscles in that area strong and to increase your range of motion. Does that sound OK?

P: That sounds good. Alright, thank you so much.

D: OK. Do you take any regular medications?

P: Uh no, I don't even take vitamins.

D: OK. Any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?

P: I had an arm fracture when I was younger, but that's it.

D: OK, but other than that, nothing else?

P: No.

D: OK. And currently right now, do you smoke cigarettes at all? 

P: No.

D: Have you smoked in the past? 

P: No.

D: Any recreational drugs like marijuana?

P: No. 

D: OK. And do you drink alcohol?

P: Once in a while I'll have like a glass of wine every week.

D: OK. And yeah, those are pretty much all the questions I have right now. Do you have any questions?

P: Uh, no, what can I do about this runny nose?

D: Yeah, so it seems like it's been going on for more than one and a half week. What, what is reassuring is that you're not having any other symptoms that are concerning, like you're not having any cough, you're not having any green or yellow sputum, you're not having any fevers, so it seems that you might just be having a cold, which can be caused by just a viral, uh, infection, but it should go away on its own. Just make sure that you're getting some rest, you're hydrating well, uhm, you can get some over the counter medications like Tylenol cold for example, but for now I would say we should just wait and watch. But just in case, also, since it is one of the symptoms that's for covid as well, in this time period we will just get a covid swab just in case, but most likely it's nothing to be worried about. Until you get your test, I would recommend staying isolated. And then we can go on from there, is that, does that sound good to you?

P: Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you so much. 

D: You're welcome, take care.

P: You too.

P: Not so well I I feel like I've been having just worsening breathlessness and a cough for it's been going on for two years now and I just can't seem to get rid of it. 

D: OK, the cough and breathlessness both started two years ago?

P: Yeah, I would say approximately around the same time. 

D: OK, OK. Um, do you always have the breathlessness, or does it come and go?

P: Um, I think it's, I feel short of breath most of the times, but it's mainly just gets worse when I'm exerting myself when I'm walking more than usual or just working in the garden.

D: OK, OK, um and same thing with the cough? It gets worse when you're walking around?

P: Yeah, I would say so.

D: OK. And was there any sort of trigger for this two years ago? Anything that you remember?

P: Um, no, it kind of just started gradually on its own. No, no real triggers that I can remember. 

D: OK, and, does anything make it worse or better besides the exertion?

P: Uh, no, I think that's pretty much the only thing that really makes it worse. 

D: OK, and how would you describe your breathlessness? Is it that you're breathing too fast or you can't catch your breath?

P: It's I think it's more so just I can't catch my breath and sometimes I just have trouble being able to take like a full breath. 

D: OK, OK. Um, and out of 1 to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is your breathlessness?

P: No, not that I know.

D: No um, and have you traveled anywhere recently?

P: No, I've never really had this issue before, so no investigations. 

D: OK, OK, well those were all the questions that I had. Did you have anything that you wanted to add that I maybe missed?

P: Uh, no, I just it's been going on for two years and I feel like it's getting worse and worse. And yeah, I'm just scared of having to, you know, go on oxygen or like just not being able to breathe at one point.

D: Yeah, for sure. So we will try to do a good job working you up for everything that we think it may be. And right now, it sounds like it could be pulmonary fibrosis either like you know an autoimmune process or triggered after like an infection that you may have had in the past. We will definitely also look into see if it's perhaps a lung cancer, asthma and you mentioned you don't smoke so we don't think it could be COPD but we'll also test for that in case all everything else comes back negative.

P: OK, sounds good. Thank you so much.

P: No, no one has been sick recently, at least in my house, but uh, just two weeks ago I did attend a family event, and just last week I found out, uhm, someone was having symptoms. They just got tested two days ago and their test result hasn't come back.

P: Yeah, I was just wondering, I don't know the results of the contact that I had, uh, so should I also get tested today?

D: Yeah, certainly with nonspecific symptoms such as what you've been experiencing, we will do a test for covid today. However, we will do some lab investigations as well, because it could be something else, so we'll wait for some of those results to come back, and it's great that you've already taken the initiative to isolate from family members and whatnot. And so I ask you to continue doing so, and we will get back to you when the results are in.

That was around like 5 days ago and then it turned into just a lot of congestion, like around my nose and like my throat.

D: OK, uhm, and what was done at that time?

P: At that time it kind of just went away on it's own. It got better. I feel it's definitely worse this time. But at that time I didn't even go to the doctor, it kind of just went away.

P: No,  I think that's all. I just didn't know if I needed any, like, medications or if I needed to get tested. I just wanted to make sure.

D: Yeah, so well, certainly check your temperature to see if you have a fever. And if you do and it's high enough, that will increase the chance that you have a bacterial sinusitis,  and if so, with some of your symptoms, including the discharge, obstruction, loss of smell, and facial pain, that all fits the picture for it and also you had a period where you felt a little bit better and then worse again. So that might require antibiotics, but we will check your temperature and go from there.

P: No.

D: No, OK. How about immunizations? Are you up to date? 

P: Yeah I am.

D: OK. Um any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?

P: Uh, no. 

D: How about cancers?

P: Nothing like that.

D: OK, and do you smoke?

P: No. 

D: Um how about marijuana?

P: Uh sometimes I'll have a joint with friends or something like that on the weekend, but um yeah, so maybe once a week.

D: Once a week, OK. Um, how about alcohol, do you drink any alcohol? 

P: Uh, no

D: No, OK. Um and where do you live right now?

P: Um possibly, um I mean, I'm in sales, so meeting with clients all day, um maybe one of them were sick.

D: Yeah, yeah for sure. Um, any travel recently?

P: Uh no travel, all the meetings have been in the city.

D: OK, OK good. So those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own or anything that you wanted to discuss today that I missed? 

P: Um no, that, I was just worried about uh Covid. 

D: Yeah, so that's definitely top on the list right now for things that we have to rule you out for. Um so we'll take a swab today, we'll send it off um for those PCR results, you should hear back in 24 to 48 hours. Uh in the meantime, you should isolate for 14 days, and that includes from family members when possible, and public health will get in touch with you if those results are positive and so they can they can do some contact tracing. If it's not Covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around, and I guess the best therapy for that is staying hydrated, um getting good sleep, and eating nutritious foods. Uh but if your symptoms get worse, like you're running a really high fever, um you're having neurological symptoms like you know seizures or fainting spells, um or if you're having difficulty breathing, um you should come back to the ER. So how does that sound?

P: Yeah, it's really informative. Thank you.

D: Alright, take care.

P: Thank you.",659.8326875,us_medical
RES0168,data/final_audio/RES0168.mp3,"D: What brings you in? 

P: So I've just I had some sinus problems in the past. I've had some sinus infections and I just feel like I have one right now and I know that like I know that you know, a lot of the time I I've done all the things that I've been told to do in the past like I've been doing, like Saline rinses and just doesn't feel like it's helping very much right now. When I rinse, I'm getting like this greenie gross kind of mucus coming out. And it's just like giving me this like headache. It just feels crappy.

D: Yeah, I'm sorry you're feeling that way. So this runny nose, OK, do you have a cough at all?

P: Uh, no I don't have a cough.

D: Any shortness of breath?

P: Uhm, I don't have a real like shortness of breath, but it does feel congested.

D: OK, how about wheeziness?

P: Uh, no wheeziness. 

D: No wheeziness, OK. And how about, how about like sore throat or loss of taste?

P: Uhm, uh so my throat not sore in like the way that you get catch a sore throat but I get a lot of post nasal drip and it makes it like stingy. So it's like it's sore in that way, but it's not like you know if you have like strep throat or something. 

D: OK. How about changes in your vision or hearing?

P: No, nothing like that.

D: Weight loss?

P: No.

D: Ah, OK.

P: So my thermometer said that's high, I don't, I don't really know, but yeah.

D: OK and how about like, facial pain or pressure or feeling like it's full?

P: Oh yeah, I have that. It's like yeah, all on the front part of my face.

D: OK. And then you mentioned some nasal obstruction, some discharge and you said no loss of smell, right?

P: No, I didn't lose any smell. Like sometimes it's kind of hard to smell because it's so plugged up.

D: Right. 

P: I still have like I'm able to smell like, especially after I do the rinses. It helps a little bit.

D: OK, how about like a chest pain?

P: Uhm, no, I haven't had any chest pain.

D: No, OK. Any issues with bowel movements or have those been normal? 

P: Those have been normal.

D: OK. Any changes in your urine?

P: No.

D: No, OK. Any headaches? 

P: Yeah, like I get that like sinusy headache that you know, it's pretty common for me, like kind of just all in like the front of my face and sometimes it kind of feels like it goes all over.

D: How about umm, how about like dizziness or fainting?

P: No.

D: No, OK. Are you otherwise healthy or do you have any longstanding medical conditions?

P: No, this is pretty well, pretty well the only thing. I had some problems with my knee like I had some problems with the ACL, so like I see like an orthopaedic person for that, but otherwise, otherwise I'm healthy.

D: OK. OK, uhm, and are you on any medications?

P: No, like I I sometimes like I used this saline rinse.

D: OK.

P: For a bit. I used to use the nasal steroid spray and I I hadn't had an infection for awhile and things were feeling OK, so I haven't been using it recently. Umm, and then I occasionally will use like, like an Advil if my knees sore. 

D: OK. OK, and no hospitalizations or surgeries?

P: Uh, so I had an ACL repair surgery.

D: Oh right, yeah, OK.

P: And like I went to the emergency department once when I had a bad sinus infection, but I didn't like stay over at the hospital.

D: OK, OK. How about immunizations? Are you up to date?

P: I think so. I never really didn't get any.

D: OK. Any allergies?

P: Uh, like a little bit to cats but nothing else.

D: OK. Any family history of lung or heart conditions?

P: No, not that I know of. 

D: OK. How about smoking, do you smoke? 

P: No, no.

D: No, OK. Do you drink alcohol?

P: I drink a few beers on the weekend.

D: OK. 

P: You know five or six per weekend.

D: OK. And then, five or six for weekend. OK and any recreational drugs?

P: I will occasionally take like a cannabis, like a capsule like the oil in the capsule.

D: OK, and what is that for?

P: Just like recreational. Also like I mean my knee, my knee pain. Sometimes it helps. 

D: Mhmm, OK.

P: But essentially that that might be like once like per month or something.

D: OK. OK. Alright, and, any sick contacts recently?

P: No, no. I've been working from home.

D: OK. OK, and any travel recently?

P: No.

D: No, OK. And where do you live?

P: I live here in town with my wife and our teenage son.

D: OK. Is anyone at home sick?

P: No, they're fine.

D: They're fine. OK, and what about.. Sorry?

P: They're both working from home like doing school from home too. So we rarely don't go anywhere like my wife goes to get groceries and that's about it.

D: OK, I see. And any old carpets, smoke, asbestos, mold anything like that at home?

P: No, no, it's a pretty new house.

D: OK, alright, any pets at home?

P: We have a dog. It's a labradoodle. 

D: OK, yeah.

P: And that's it, yeah.

D: How long have you had him? 

P: Oh, like, he's like 3 now. Like my sinus infections and that have been going on for longer than we've had him.

D: OK, alright. Those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for me? 

P: I don't think so. I just I hope you know, we can do something about this. Because you know, I tried all this stuff that is supposed to be like, you know, conservative like the first steps and it just doesn't seem like it's getting better. It's been like few weeks. So, I thought it was probably time to come see you. 

D: Yeah, sorry. What have you tried at home again?

P: So I use the, the rinses the saline rinses. I used a little bit of nasal decongestant but I know like I know I've been told I'm not supposed to do that for more than a few days, so I don't. Yeah, that's, I think that's pretty well it 'cause they said there's not much we can really do.

D: OK, yeah. So your symptoms, OK because some some of these things overlap with Covid, we're going to have to swab you and they'll notify you of your results in like 24 to 48 hours. But what it sounds like is something called Sinu, Sinusitis and it sounds like acute bacterial rhinosinusitis because of some f the symptoms that you have, and it's been going on for more than a week and it's, it's not going away with the rinse, saline rinses and these decongestants. So we will prescribe some antibiotics for you. Probably amoxicillin. Take those for five to seven days and see if some of your symptoms clear up. If they continue to be severe, umm, actually, at this will also prescribe you some inhaled corticosteroids because I think those can help as well, so will give you both of those for now and then just follow up with us in a week after you've tried both things and we'll see how your symptoms are holding up at that point. Does that sound like a good plan to you?

P: Yeah, I think that sounds that sounds fair. Yeah, thank you. 

D: OK, yeah no problem.",653.0739375,us_medical
RES0009,data/final_audio/RES0009.mp3,"D: To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brought you in today?

P: Really I just don't I I don't feel quite right like I've had this pain in my chest for five days now and I've been just feeling kind of out of breath.

D: Oh OK, um where are you feeling this pain?

P: Um, it's it's kind of um. On the left side of my chest and it's just like a tiny. It's like a lingering sharp pain. I don't really feel it anywhere else. It's just kind of there all the time right now. I I've never had anything like this before.

D: OK, so you're not feeling the pain radiate any to any other locations. You're just feeling it sort of in the one spot on the left side?

P: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

D: OK, and since this pain started 5 days ago, has it gotten any better, any worse, or stayed the same?

P: Like when I when it started I was just I was just like sitting on my couch. Um and now it's harder if I'm, it's worse if I'm walking around, like if I walk just down the street to get the mail. But otherwise it's kind of kind of just there, like I took some Tylenol and Advil, and they maybe take the edge off a little bit, but it's always there. And it's worse when I, when I take a deep breath then I really feel it.

D: OK, so it's worse. Is the pain worse when you're walking as well? Like out to get the mail?

P: It's I don't the the pain is, but I I'm not I can't catch my breath when I'm doing that.

D: OK, and how far could you usually walk, or um? 

P: Oh yeah, usually walk before I go for long walks like every day, like probably like 5 kilometers or something.

D: OK, so prior to this happening you were feeling well?

P: Yeah, totally. I've not ever had any problems with my heart or lungs or anything. I thought it was maybe just like a chest infection. But I I don't know anymore. 

D: OK, so you've had that, the difficulties breathing and the pain. And have you had any other symptoms?

P: Mmm I think it's just those those, the two things that I said.

D: OK, so have you been experiencing any fevers or chills?

P: No. Nothing like that.

D: OK, how about any nausea or vomiting?

P: No.

D: OK, and um, how is your energy been? Have you experienced any like significant fatigue?

P: Um. Not. Well, I mean, I've been doing less stuff because it's harder to breathe like I'm getting kind of like I can't catch my breath. So I guess maybe maybe a little bit like fatigue.

D: I see OK, but feeling fine energy-wise prior to the two 5 days ago?

P: Yeah, totally. 

D: OK, uh and, have you been having any night sweats?

P: Uh, no, no I haven't.

D: OK, how about any unusual headaches?

P: No.

D: Alright, and have you felt as though your heart is racing or beating out of your chest at all?

P: No, no, it's just that like sharp that sharp pain.

D: OK, have you had any episodes of lightheadedness or feeling like you, you might might faint?

P: No, no, just the difficulty breathing that scares to me, but it hasn't been like that.

D: OK, have you had a cough?

P: No, no, that's the thing, that it seems weird, right?

D: OK, um sometimes things can be associated with a cough so we'll absolutely look into what the causes of your symptoms are today. But you haven't brought up any any blood or any sputum?

P: No no. 

D: OK, and have you had any wheezing with your with your breath?

P: I don't know. I don't think so.

D: Alright, and how about any abdominal pain?

P: No, I mean the pain is like, yeah, it's in my chest. Yeah, that's not in my it's not in my belly at all. 

D: OK, and have you had any urinary problems?

P: No, I mean so I had. I had a I had a hysterectomy. Weeks ago, maybe like maybe like a month ago now, um? So after that it was, you know, feeling a little. Like I was kind of not drinking as much and that so I wasn't peeing as much then, but I think it's normal now.

D: OK um. And how have you recovered since the hysterectomy? Were you like bedbound for quite awhile afterwards or were you up an active?

P: Really, it was not really long that I may be a few days, I wasn't. I wasn't walking as much, but I thought it was like back to my normal self. 

D: OK, well that's good. I'm glad that you recovered from that surgery quickly. And what was the surgery for?

P: Uh, I uh. I mean I, I'm done having kids and I, uh, I had. I was just having really heavy periods still so, uh, and you know a lot of pain there, so hat's why I had hysterectomy.

D: OK, um, and have you had any bowel problems?

P: No no.

D: OK, how about any skin changes or or rashes?

P: No. 

D: OK, how about any joint pains or or leg pains or muscle pains?

P: Uh, no, I don't think so.

D: OK. Um, so in regards to past health, any previous medical diagnosis?

P: Uh, no. Just like I had the hysterectomy but I I don't like take any medications I don't have like high blood pressure or anything.

D: OK so no prescription medications or over the counter medications you take regularly like supplements or?

P: No, just just to those like the Advil and the Tylenol I was taking for the pain.

D: OK. And any other surgeries besides the hysterectomy?

P: Uh, like I have my wisdom teeth out when I was like a teenager. That's it though.

D: OK, then, how about any allergies?

P: None.

D: OK, and are your immunizations up to date?

P: I think so, um. Yeah, yeah I don't. Yeah, I don't think, I didn't get anything that was supposed to.

D: OK, well, that's good. And, uh, has anybody in your family experienced anything like this before?

P: My mom had a heart attack when she was like in her 70s. Uh. Other than that, I don't. I don't know. I don't think so.

D: OK, any, um, cancers in the family or or bleeding disorders or coagulations disorders?

P: Um, no, I don't think so.

D: OK, so I haven't heard of anybody in the family having like a blood clot, or or a thrombosis anywhere?

P: I think my mom's like cousin, but not no one like not like my parents or anything.

D: OK, um, so the next few questions I just wanted to ask about your personal and kind of lifestyle habits a little bit. But first, could you tell me about your living situation?

P: Uh, yeah I live. Um, like I said like I'm done having kids but I have 2 two kids. They're teenagers. I live um, with them and my husband and, uh. We live not far from here.

D: OK, and what do you do for work?

P: Um, Im an accountant.

D: OK, and do you drink alcohol?

P: Um maybe a glass of wine on like the weekends but? Not other than no.

D: OK and do you smoke cigarettes?

P: I do, I'm trying to stop. I smoke maybe like. I don't know like 5 per day or something at this point.

D: OK, but it sounds like you've been working on cutting down which is great. Um and have you used any other recreational drugs?

P: Um, no, no. I mean, when I was like younger I sometimes like would use marijuana, but I haven't really recently. 

D: OK, and have you been any been on any like long trips recently?

P: No I wish.

D: Fair enough, vacation would be great. Um, OK so. But that was all the questions that I wanted to ask on on history, were going to run some investigations. I am concerned that you might have a pulmonary embolism, and so we're going to do some lab work and imaging to investigate that.

P: OK I yeah. Is that scary? Is that bad?

D: It can vary from being mild to severe, and so that's what we want to get. Some of the imaging and lab work to see well to first confirm if that's what you actually have, and if so, offer the right treatment.

P: OK thanks doctor.

D: Welcome will get that started.",768.31325,us_medical
RES0098,data/final_audio/RES0098.mp3,"D: How may I help you?

P: So, I just came in here because for the last day I've been just getting shortness of breath. I recently, yesterday actually, was just busy at home, cleaning out my basement. And, like that was yesterday afternoon, I did that for a couple hours and then at night I just started to get the shortness of breath. It's continued until today. I'm also getting some wheezing and tightness in my chest as well as some cough. So yeah, that's all just been happening over the last day.

D: OK, and uh, is the shortness of breath here now? is it, is at rest? Or are you having that when you're exerting yourself?

p: More so when I'm like exerting myself, if I'm sitting down it's better, but I still have, I would say, like my breathing is not normal right now, like it's, I still have to take deeper breaths. And I do have that chest tightness when I take those deep breaths.

D: OK, do you have any chest pain?

P: No, it's more so just the tightness. I wouldn't call it pain, but I do still have a little bit of wheezing.

D: OK.

P: So yeah, that's, that's that.

D: And you mentioned a cough as well. With the cough is it, has it been dry, or have you been bringing up sputum?

P: Uhm, it was, it was mainly dry yesterday, like, like the cough has kind of gone away, but yesterday night I was coughing a lot and it was mostly dry.

D: OK, have you brought up any blood?

P: No. 

D: OK, and have you had any infectious symptoms like, eye tearing or red eyes, maybe a runny nose or sore throat?

P: Uhm, not a sore throat, but it does feel like it, it's kind of like just constricted in there like, uhm, I don't know if it's relevant, but I, I do have asthma. Uh, like I was diagnosed ten years ago, but it's been pretty stable, like it's, like just right now. I haven't had shortness of breath for a pretty long time. 

D: OK, uh, and, uh, we'll get back to the past medical history shortly, I just wanted to ask a few more symptoms, but certainly could be relevant today. Uhm, so uhm, so you mentioned that you have had some throat tightness. Have you had any loss of smell or, or loss of taste? 

P: No, nothing like that.

D: OK, and have you had any fevers or chills?

P: No.

D: OK, have you had any nausea or vomiting?

P: No, no nausea or vomitting.

D: How about, any diarrhea or Constipation?

P: No.

D: And have you had any urinary problems like painful or frequency?

P: No.

D: OK and have you had any night sweats over the last several weeks to months?

P: No, nothing like that.

D: And, uhm, have you had any weight changes over the last little while?

P: No.

D: OK. And have you noticed any skin changes or rashes?

P: Uh, no, I, I do have just like the general, like, eczema, that I use a cream for, but that's just normal for me. 

D: OK. And any muscle aches or, or joint pains?

P: No. 

D: Have you had any fatigue? 

P: No.

D: OK, alright you mentioned asthma as part of your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions?

P: No, it's just asthma and it was diagnosed, I think when I was like, probably 11 or 12 years old.

D: OK, and do you use inhalers for that?

P: Yeah, I have two inhalers, uh, like one, one is like a blue one, one is like an, like an orange one, uh, it's, so I think it's one of them is just like, I take whenever I really need to and the other one I take every day. Uhm, and I haven't been taking the one, uh, I think it's called Ventolin. But I took it like, uh, had to take it like three or four times last night and like, throughout the day yesterday. And it, it did help, but it didn't really relieve some of my symptoms.

D: OK, and prior to that, how often have you been using, uhm, the blue one. 

P: The blue one before yesterday, probably the last time I used it was probably like a month ago. 

D: OK, so you don't need it that that often then?

P: No.

D: Do you have any triggers for asthma that you're aware of, like exercising or going out into the cold or even like allergies like dust or, or, or pollen?

P: Uhm, I do have allergies in the spring. I think it's to pollen and in the winter, it does, like my symptoms do get a bit worse and I have to use the ventil more. But recently for the last few months at least, it's been pretty stable. I haven't really had to use, use it too much.

D: OK, and, and do you use any other medications?

P: Uh, just when I have allergies. I, I just use over the counter allergy meds.

D: OK, and you use a cream for, for your skin too like, yeah?

P: Yeah, I use, like it's, it's, I think it's like a mixture of like a steroid cream. 

D: OK, and do you have any allergies to medications?

P: Not that I know of.

D: OK, and are your immunizations up to date?

P: Yeah.

D: Alright, and right now, who are you living with, and whereabouts are you living?

P: Yeah, so I'm just living with a couple roommates. I just go to college and I'm living with three other roommates.

D: OK, and has anybody been sick?

p: No, everyone's been fine.

D: And have you traveled anywhere?

P: Uhm, I decided, like, I, yesterday I went home like, to my parents house and helped my dad, that's where I was cleaning the basement. But besides that, that was, that was uh, that was it?

D: OK, and  sorry, just had to backtrack a little bit. Have you had any hospitalizations, either due to asthma or for any other reason?

P: Uhm, I think when I was 15, I, I had to go to the emergency department, but I, I wasn't hospitalized.

D: OK, and was this, uh, did you have similar symptoms at that time?

P: Yeah, it was, uh, it was for asthma and like, uh, that time it was definitely much much worse and I remember like I was breathing a lot, uh, the shortness of breath was really bad and the ventolin like puffers weren't even helping me at that time.

D: OK yeah, OK, and have you had any surgeries before?

P: No.

D: Alright, so yeah, you mentioned that you're, you're cleaning up the basement yesterday? Was there a lot of dust down there or anything like that, that might have triggered it?

P: Yeah, we were like just moving boxes. There were books here and there that definitely there would have been dust. I should have been more careful, like wore a mask, but I didn't think about it at that time.

D: OK yeah for sure, uh, and do you smoke cigarettes?

P: No, like I can't even stand cigarette smoke.

D: OK, that's good. And do you smoke marijuana or use any cannabis products?

P: Uh, no if I, if I really want marijuana, I would have to go with edibles, I, I can't take the smoke.

D: OK, I see and, do you drink alcohol?

P: Uh just, I would say probably on the weekends I might have four or five beers.

D: OK, and, anybody else in the family have asthma or skin irritation like, like you have?

P: Yeah so my, my older sister actually also was diagnosed with asthma. She also has the eczema that I have and my mom was also diagnosed with asthma when she was a child, but she's been completely fine since then.

D: OK, well that's good that, that she's been OK. Does anybody in the family have any heart or, or lung conditions or any cancers that run in the family?

P: My grandfather died of lung cancer, but he was just, just smoked all throughout his life. 

D: OK, uhm, alright, so that was all of the questions that I wanted to ask today. So the next part we'll go on to do a physical exam, but did you have any thing else that maybe I forgot to ask about today?

P: Uh, no, I, I, I think I know what this was caused by, but yeah, let's, let's see. Thanks for your help.

D: Oh you're welcome, so yeah, we'll, we'll, uhm,trial some more puffers and see what we could do, cause certainly it's sounding like an asthma exacerbation, and so definitely let somebody know if your, your breathing is getting more difficult.

P: Yep, sounds good.",680.1289375,us_medical
RES0081,data/final_audio/RES0081.mp3,"D: How can I help you?

P: Hi, my son Dave who's 5 years old, who comes to the clinic quite often, has uh, his asthma has been really bad over the past few days. I've tried his puffers, but they're not really helping much, and I'm just worried about him.

D: So what symptom is he experiencing now?

P: Uhm so, he's just having this wheezing that just doesn't go away, like, I can actually hear it, it's frightening, he's having like he's having difficulties falling asleep, he's just been very irritable, uhm, he didn't go to school yesterday. It's just, yeah, it's just, it seems like, it's just, he's not eating well either.

D: OK, so yeah, it's been affecting, uh, sleep, appetite, his mood, has he been short of breath?

P: If he was like, he said that he was having some difficulty breathing, yeah. 

D: OK, has he, uh, able to talk like in full sentences, like, how is he right now?

P: Yeah, he's  able to talk in full sentences but he just gets a little bit breathless when he's eating, which I think is probably why he's not eating much. But yeah, he's able to talk, he's not talking much either, just been like, just been in a mood, you know, he gets a little bit breathless when he's crying.

D: OK, I see, and, has he had a cough?

D: OK, and two days ago, can you think of any triggers like, was there any exposure to dust or smoke or maybe even pets that could have brought this on?

P: Yeah, you know, if I think about it, he did go outside to play with his brother and, I don't know he might have got something out there maybe.

D: Yeah, uh, certainly possible and was it like a particularly cold day?

D: OK, and do you use a spacer?

P: I would love that.

D: That's great, and has he been using any other medications to help over these last couple of days besides the inhalers?

P: No, just the inhalers, we've also kept it the usual one, the one that he takes, the other inhaler.

D: OK, and have you had any concerns with growth or developmental milestones?

P: No, no, the doc was pretty happy when he did the regular, the checkup and yeah things are good with him, he's a good kid.

D: Awesome, OK, and could you tell me a little bit about the living situation, like who's the main caregiver and who he's living with?

P: Yeah, so he lives with me, his dad and his brother who is 2 years older and he's not going to school right now. We're just keeping him at home due to Covid and trying to do some home schooling. I'm a homemaker, so I do have enough time to spend time with him and his older brother and, yeah.

D: OK, has anybody in the home been sick, either his brother, yourself, or father?

P: Uh, no.

D: OK, and anybody, at work or any other places that you maybe traveled to, that, uh, been around anybody who's been sick?

D: OK, and are there any pets in the home?

P: No.

D: Alright, any carpets or like, uh, curtains or anything like that, covering the windows?

P: No 

D: Cystic fibrosis or anything like that?

P: No no, no.

D: OK, uhm, so was there any other, anything else that maybe I forgot to ask about or I'm missing that you'd like to add today?

P: No, I'm just worried that he's going to have a big asthma attack like last year, I just also want to make sure nothing else is going on and if he can be taken care of and he's just, he's feeling awful.

D: For sure, yeah, we'll, uh, check his his vital signs and do a physical exam. And it does sound like it could be an asthma exacerbation, and so we can trial some inhaler medications, a little bit different than what you use at home. But also using Ventolin as well and we'll assess the need for potential, uh, antibiotics and also steroid if necessary and if his breathing gets worse or you're starting to hear that the wheezing is getting worse or his work of breathing is becoming more intense then certainly we'll need to add on some oxygen and possibly, some other therapies.

D: OK, OK, well those were the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for me?

P: No, I I was just wondering what this can be.

D: Um yeah, so the first thing we want to rule out as covid because a lot of your symptoms overlap with those of covid, so we'll take a swab and you should get those results in about 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, you should isolate for 14 days. And if your results are positive, public health will be in touch with you to do some contact tracing. But if it's not covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around this time of year that could be causing similar symptoms as well, but either way the management kind of is supportive, so making sure you're well hydrated, eating nutritious food, sleeping well, taking antipyretics like Tylenol for fever's if you get any. And you can also take Tylenol or anseads for muscle ache, joint pains, anything like that. Does that sound OK?

P: Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you.

P: She has this pink eye and she has a cough.

D: Yeah, right, that could be conjunctivitis. OK, so at this point we will certainly run some investigations to look into what this could be. It sounds like a viral infectious type of process, especially if it's involving the eyes, nose, and and with a cough. And so we will test with a swab for covid for sure. But it could be something more common, like the common cold. We just need to make sure that we're comprehensive in that with the testing.

P: That sounds great, thank you.",588.6968125,us_medical
