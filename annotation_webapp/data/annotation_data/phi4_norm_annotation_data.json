PATIENT: <UNSURE>Yeah. Yeah</UNSURE>, I am. PATIENT: Yes, yes I am. DOCTOR: Great. So, how can I help? PATIENT: Yeah, so, <UNSURE>have a</UNSURE> <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. I've been having a cough and a sore throat, for about a week, and, it's been causing me problems. I've had to stay away from work, for about three or four of those days, because of how bad <UNSURE>is</UNSURE>. DOCTOR: OK, I'm sorry to hear that. So, you've had a cough, and a sore throat, for about a week? DOCTOR: And what came, what, what came first? PATIENT: Yes. PATIENT: Uh, the, sore throat came first, and then, after a day or two, the cough. DOCTOR: OK, OK. And, uh, are you <UNSURE>coughing</UNSURE> up anything? PATIENT: No, it's very dry. DOCTOR: OK, So I'm, I'm just gonna ask a few questions about the, uh, your current symptoms. And a little bit about your background. DOCTOR: Um, and, something else about what we can do, a little bit later on in the consultation, to help you. So, before we go on. <UNIN/> anything you're particularly concerned about? Um, or have any ideas, what might be going on? You said that you had a cold. PATIENT: <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE>. PATIENT: <UNIN/>, well. PATIENT: I mean, you <UNIN/>, you know how, we all are. Once this happens, you Google it and, there seems to be, all kinds of bad things it could be. It could be, could be a cold or, flu obviously, but it could also be tuberculosis. It <UNSURE>could</UNSURE> be, cancer always comes up so. PATIENT: <UNSURE>It'll</UNSURE> be good if, none of those. DOCTOR: Great, so, so yeah. I can provide a bit of reassurance, um, and uh, we can talk about those a little bit, as well. And was <UNSURE>there anything</UNSURE> you were particularly expecting, or hoping to get out of this consultation? Um. PATIENT: OK. PATIENT: Uh. <UNSURE>Uh</UNSURE>, well, uh yeah, so reassurance. So like, hopefully some sense that it's not anything too serious. But also, <UNSURE>is there</UNSURE> anything you can prescribe me to make it better? Or any advice? PATIENT: Or maybe even a sick note. So that, if I need to stay away from work for a bit longer, I can get one. DOCTOR: Sure, sure, OK. All right, so, we'll talk a little bit about the symptoms, and I'm sure we can <UNIN/>, get a, um, those things, uh, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> and some reassurance, um, about your concerns. PATIENT: <UNSURE>OK</UNSURE>. DOCTOR: So, um, you mentioned that you started with sore throat about a week ago, developed into bit of a dry cough. Um, <UNIN/>, I'll just ask a few questions around those. So, um, do you have any shortness of breath? PATIENT: <UNSURE>No</UNSURE>. PATIENT: Yes, yes, I've been having shortness of, <UNIN/>. Yeah, I've been having shortness of breath, yeah. DOCTOR: You are short of breath. And, uh, do you have any wheeze? Or chest pain? PATIENT: <UNSURE>Uh</UNSURE>, yeah, a bit of both <UNIN/>. DOCTOR: You're, you're feeling a bit wheezy, with some chest pain as well. PATIENT: Yes. DOCTOR: OK. And, how, ah, when did you start to develop the shortness of breath? PATIENT: <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. So, so the sore throat, so today's <UNSURE>Friday</UNSURE>, sore throat was about, last week, Friday or Thursday. PATIENT: Cough was Saturday or Sunday. So the, so the, shortness of breath was I think, shortly after the cough. So maybe a day or two later. So, three, four days ago. DOCTOR: Three or four days ago, you started develop <UNIN/>. And is the cough worse at night-time? PATIENT: No, no, it's the same throughout the <UNSURE>whole</UNSURE> day. DOCTOR: Same throughout the day. Um, and, uh, when you say you're short of breath. DOCTOR: Just need to try and get an idea about how short of breath you are. So, are you able to, <UNSURE>so</UNSURE> <UNIN/>, um, so, uh, like walk up a flight of stairs, for example? Um, or, or, are you short of breath at rest? PATIENT: Ohh yeah, it's, it's like, <UNSURE>so</UNSURE> when I'm doing <UNSURE>walking</UNSURE>. Um, and I do exercises <UNSURE>now and then</UNSURE>. So it, it hasn't been . PATIENT: Superbad like, hasn't stopped me from doing any of those things, but it's been pretty unusual, and a little bit worrying. DOCTOR: And you're a bit concerned about that, OK. DOCTOR: So, I just need to ask a few, uh, things about your background as well. So, um, do you have any other medical conditions, or medical history? PATIENT: No, just, no, no <UNIN/>, past medical history, no. DOCTOR: No <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. No history of asthma? PATIENT: No. DOCTOR: Um, and any, uh, uh, history of, uh, clots on your legs, or your lungs? DOCTOR: <UNSURE>So these</UNSURE> <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. Uh, no one in your family's had those? Clots on the legs, or the lungs? PATIENT: <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> PATIENT: Well, my mother had lung cancer. DOCTOR: Your mother had lung cancer. Do you smoke? PATIENT: No. DOCTOR: You ever smoked? Or been exposed to asbestos? That you know of? PATIENT: Don't know with asbestos. Ever smoked, <UNIN/>. I mean, once or twice in Amsterdam, if that counts, but, not really. DOCTOR: OK. Um, and, uh, this, so just going back to the, your symptoms of shortness of breath, with the cough. It's a dry cough, no, you're not coughing up any flem? DOCTOR: Um, do, do you have, uh, and you don't, you say you don't have any chest pain, as such? DOCTOR: Um. Uh, are you taking any medications, currently, at the moment? PATIENT: Uh. No, no. DOCTOR: OK. Are you allergic to any medications? PATIENT: Not to any medication, but I'm allergic to peanuts. DOCTOR: Peanuts. OK. Um, and, uh. DOCTOR: You mentioned that your mother had, uh, lung cancer. Um, any other, family history of any significant illnesses, uh, run, running in your family? PATIENT: No, no, that's the only one. Just lung cancer, from my mother. DOCTOR: Just lung cancer. OK. DOCTOR: And you say you have a cold. So, do you have <UNIN/>, sinus congestion? Or, um. PATIENT: No, it seems to be <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, <UNIN/> entirely with just my throat. So like, my nose is <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> like, <UNIN/>. DOCTOR: So, <UNIN/>, just your, just your throat. And, any recent travel? Or have you always lived in the UK? PATIENT: Uh, no, so <UNSURE>I, I</UNSURE>, I haven't always lived in the UK. Like, so I was born in the US, and moved over. PATIENT: Well, it was twelve years ago, but, in terms of recent travel. Just to Europe, nowhere too exotic. DOCTOR: OK, so no, so no recent travel, no significant recent travel any, anywhere. Um, OK. DOCTOR: And, are you coughing up anything other than, <UNIN/>. Um, uh, so you, you're not coughing up blood, or anything like that? No, no. DOCTOR: Um, good. And, uh, are you feeling feverish, hot, cold, sweaty? PATIENT: Yeah, so, a little bit feverish, uh, um, at first. So the first three or so days of this, but then it, the fever's gone away. DOCTOR: OK. And in general, do you <UNIN/>. Sorry? Yeah. PATIENT: <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> PATIENT: Yeah, I was just gonna say, also had a bit of a headache. But like, headaches that come and go rather, but like, right now it's fine. DOCTOR: <UNSURE>Uh</UNSURE>. DOCTOR: OK. And in general, would you say you're feeling, you're, you're beginning to, to feel better? Worse? Or, or sort of, um, staying the same? PATIENT: <UNIN/>, so it's like, it's up and down. So, so let's see, so I, <UNIN/>, it started last week, and I stayed home from work two days this week. PATIENT: I think it was maybe, Tuesday and then Thursday. So like, I felt better and then worse again, and then better and then worse again. So it's been, yeah, a kind of constant, but constant and being, variable, if that makes <UNIN/>. DOCTOR: OK. DOCTOR: And I just <UNIN/>, need to ask any, other sort of risk factors. Um. DOCTOR: That you may have. So, <UNIN/>, um, no sort of significant weight loss? Um, or unexplained weight loss? Any <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>? PATIENT: So no weight loss, but I have been, have been losing my appetite recently. And I mean, I usually eat a lot so, and I, and I enjoy eating as well, but like, so that's been a bit concerning. DOCTOR: You've been losing your appetite recently? PATIENT: Yes. DOCTOR: And you're a little bit concerned about that? But you haven't, you haven't lost any weight, that you think of? PATIENT: Yes. PATIENT: No. Not that <UNIN/>. DOCTOR: And any, um, sort of rashes or anything? <UNSURE>Or</UNSURE>, uh, <UNIN/>, and you. PATIENT: No. Not <UNIN/>. DOCTOR: <UNSURE>Not that</UNSURE>, not that you can think of. OK. DOCTOR: Um. So, I would ask to examine you now, but um, I, I don't know if I could sort of look inside your throat, at least. To see if there's a, probably, <UNSURE>there's</UNSURE>. PATIENT: Ohh, we can try <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. DOCTOR: Ohh no, well, no, it's OK, I <UNIN/>, might think about doing <UNSURE>a</UNSURE>. Have you got any lumps or bumps around your neck? That you can feel? PATIENT: <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> PATIENT: Uh. PATIENT: No. DOCTOR: No that you, no, OK. DOCTOR: Um. And, so finally, you, you were talking about, uh, <UNIN/>. I mean, it sounds to me that, um, you've been a little bit up and down. Sore throat. Developed a dry cough. DOCTOR: Um, you are slightly short of breath, but not too overly concerningly short of breath. What I would say, we're just coming to the end of consultation now, <UNIN/>. If you feel significantly worse . PATIENT: <UNSURE>Mm-hmm</UNSURE>. DOCTOR: Um. Uh, if you get more short of breath, or sudden change in your breathlessness. Um, or breathlessness that you are concerned about. Then I would advise you to <UNSURE>see, no</UNSURE> <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, go and see a GP. Um, and actually see somebody physically. DOCTOR: Um, uh, but I think, for now I can sort of, uh, try and reassure you that, um, if this clears up, as I expect it would. So, I expect this to sort of be getting better in the next, four or five days. Um, if it's not, please get in touch with a medical professional again. DOCTOR: Um, and, uh, I would expect it to, and so therefore, I wouldn't be concerned about tuberculosis DOCTOR: Um, your concerns about lung cancer, are. And, was that the other thing <UNSURE>you're</UNSURE> concerned about? PATIENT: Ohh yeah, yeah. Yeah. DOCTOR: Yeah. So, so, um, again, if you're not getting better, please see somebody again. DOCTOR: Um, I've just got four seconds now. So, nice talking to you. And, have we gotta? We gotta, tidy up, yeah. OK, so, uh. PATIENT: <UNSURE>All right</UNSURE>. DOCTOR: Uh, and I'll provide you with a sick note, just to give you a few more days off work. DOCTOR: Um, and paracetemol. Lots of fluids. Um, and, uh, rest up. And, as I say, if you're not feeling better, please get in touch. OK? PATIENT: <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> PATIENT: Have a good day. DOCTOR: <UNIN/>. Thank you. PATIENT: Bye.",

    "human_transcript": "D: Would you mind by starting with what brought you in?\n\nP: Yeah, so over the last week I've just been feeling some symptoms. It kind of first started with, like a runny nose. That was around like 5 days ago and then it turned into just a lot of congestion, like around my nose and like my throat. And now over the last two days I've been just feeling so much pressure around my nose and around my jaw so I've been getting a lot of pain there as well.\n\nD: OK, is your nose still running?\n\nP: Yeah, I'm still getting some discharge and I also feel like I'm getting some dripping at the back of my throat too, especially when I wake up.\n\nD: OK, and could you describe the discharge? Is it clear, yellow, greenish?\n\nP: Uh, it's fairly clear and sometimes, like a bit white, but like, it's not like green or yellow.\n\nD: OK, uh, and have you felt that it's difficult to breathe in through either of your nostrils, like it's obstructed?\n\nP: Yeah, so at night sometimes I have to like turn because one side of my nose gets difficult to breathe from and then it kind of balances out on the other side. So yeah, I do have some obstruction.\n\nD: OK, and have you had any changes to your sense of smell?\n\nP: Yeah, so just in the last three days when the congestion got really bad I started losing the ability to smell.\n\nD: OK, have you had any changes to your sense of taste?\n\nP: No, taste is fine. \n\nD: OK, and have you had any cough or sore throat?\n\nP: Uh, no. No cough or sore throat.\n\nD: OK, and the symptoms have gone on for five days. Have you had a period of time where you got better and then got sick again? \n\nP: I did kind of have a runny nose last week as well, so probably like 8 days ago but then the runny nose discontinued a little bit but really got worse 5 days ago, but all these other symptoms just happened in the last few days.\n\nD: OK, and you have pain. Do you feel it in your jaw or do you feel it in the in the front of your nose?\n\nP: Yes, I would say mainly over the cheeks. It can kind of go near the front of my teeth as well, so like I would say like mostly around the cheeks, jaws and up to the front of my teeth. \n\nD: OK, And do you grind your teeth at all at night? or have you had, TMJ issues before?\n\nP: No nothing like that. I think it's not so much on and around my teeth, it's more so just to right below my nose, above my teeth and just around my cheeks.\n\nD: OK, so no pain in your mouth or anything like that?\n\nP: No, not inside my mouth.\n\nD: OK, have you had any fevers or chills?\n\nP: Uhm, I Don't think I've had a fever. I did feel some chills over the last few days, but just very brief episodes.\n\nD: OK, and over the last few weeks have you had any weight loss? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, and you said you didn't have a cough or a sore throat, but have you had any wheezing?\n\nP: No wheezing.\n\nD: How about any shortness of breath?\n\nP: Uh, not shortness of breath. Just sometimes when my nose gets like really congested, I just turn into like a mouth breather, but that's about it.\n\nD: I see, OK, and have you had any chest pain?\n\nP: No, no chest pain. \n\nD: Alright, and any lightheadedness or feeling dizzy?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, have you had any nausea or vomiting?\n\nP: Nope. \n\nD: Any abdominal pain? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: Have you had any diarrhea?\n\nP: Sorry, what was that?\n\nD: Have you had any diarrhea?\n\nP: No diarrhea. \n\nD: OK, and have you had any urinary problems?\n\nP: Uh, no.\n\nD: And have you had any rashes or skin changes?\n\nP: No, not that I know.\n\nD: OK, then how about any muscle aches or joint aches? \n\nP: Uh, no.\n\nD: OK, and have you had any muscle weakness?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: And how has your energy been? Any fatigue?\n\nP: Uhm, it's been mainly OK, just maybe sometimes difficult to get to sleep with all the all the congestion, but I don't think my energy has been affected too much, no.\n\nD: OK, and, uh, sorry to go back to this, I don't think I asked. Did you notice any discharge from your eyes or any eye redness?\n\nP: Not discharge, but yeah, maybe a little bit of redness.\n\nD: OK, have your eyes been itchy?\n\nP: Uhm Yeah, a little bit. I would say they have been a bit itchy.\n\nD: OK, alright then, do you have any medical conditions that you see a physician for regularly? \n\nP: Uh, just uhm, its called dyslipidemia. \n\nD: OK, I see, and any medications you take for that?\n\nP: Just like a Statin medication.\n\nD: OK, do you take any other medications? over the counter? prescribed?\n\nP: No, other than that I take multivitamins.\n\nD: OK, and do you have any allergies to medications or like environmental allergies that might be getting worse?\n\nP: Uh, no, not that I know.\n\nD: OK, so you don't experience any symptoms like this when the seasons change?\n\nP: I don't think so. I have had this happen to me, Uh, I would say like once before. It happened like two years ago. It was pretty similar. \n\nD: OK, uhm, and what was done at that time?\n\nP: At that time it kind of just went away on it's own. It got better. I feel it's definitely worse this time. But at that time I didn't even go to the doctor, it kind of just went away.\n\nD: OK, I see. Any recent hospitalizations?\n\nP: No hospitalizations.\n\nD: Any surgeries?\n\nP: Nope. \n\nD: Alright, and could you tell me where abouts you're living currently and who you're living with?\n\nP: Yeah, so I'm currently living in an apartment by myself, just outside of London.\n\nD: OK, and anybody that you've been around who's had any symptoms?\n\nP: Uh, no, not that I know of.\n\nD: OK, so no sick Contacts. And have you traveled anywhere out of the city or province?\n\nP: No, I've tried to stay home, besides going to work. I just work at the grocery store. Besides that, no, nowhere else.\n\nD: OK, and any of your coworkers have any symptoms? Or any coworkers being off sick?\n\nP: No, we're pretty careful right now with the pandemic.\n\nD: I see, yeah, that's great. OK, and do you smoke cigarettes?\n\nP: No, I quit just a couple of years ago.\n\nD: Oh, that's great. It's not easy to quit, so that's awesome. And do you drink alcohol?\n\nP: Just maybe like red wine a couple of times a week.\n\nD: I see, OK, and do you use any recreational drugs? \n\nP: Uh, just, in a month, maybe once or twice, I smoke a joint.\n\nD: OK, uh, and anybody in the family have any lung or heart conditions?\n\nP: No, not that I know of.\n\nD: Alright, and how about any cancer in the family?\n\nP: Uh, no, no cancers.\n\nD: OK, I think I that was everything I wanted to ask about today. Was there any other symptoms or anything else that you wanted to make sure I knew about today?\n\nP: No,  I think that's all. I just didn't know if I needed any, like, medications or if I needed to get tested. I just wanted to make sure.\n\nD: Yeah, so well, certainly check your temperature to see if you have a fever. And if you do and it's high enough, that will increase the chance that you have a bacterial sinusitis,  and if so, with some of your symptoms, including the discharge, obstruction, loss of smell, and facial pain, that all fits the picture for it and also you had a period where you felt a little bit better and then worse again. So that might require antibiotics, but we will check your temperature and go from there. \n\nP: Alright, sounds good, thank you so much.\n\nD: Thank you.",
