    "human_transcript": "Good afternoon, Sir. I am Doctor Sadeko. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Doctor. How are you doing today, Sir? Doctor, I'm not… I'm not too fine… not too fine, that's why I came to the hospital today. What was the complaints? So, Doctor, I've been coughing for about a week now and I've been also.. also have… you also have what? So, and I also have erm… I've also been running temperature for about 5 days. So, you have running temperature for five days. Yes, Yes. For about a week now. A week? Yes. OK all right. So, the cough, did it start suddenly or gradually? The cough started suddenly, just started like that, I just… just woke up more morning and started coughing, about a week ago, yes. Was there Was there any symptoms like Catarrh or erm… any, erm… any difficulty in swallowing before the cough started? No, none like that. I had nothing like that. Nothing like that. You had nothing like that. Yes. OK, so now the cough, how does it sound? Does it sound like barking? Does it sound like it's comes in bouts and then you have to take a deep breath? When… when you say barking, do you… are you… do you mean like a dog or what do you mean by barking? Yes, yes, sounds like a dog barking. No, no, no, no, no, no, Mine is not that. I did not... I didn't experience anything like that. OK. So, is the cough productive of phlegm? Yes. Yes. It's productive when I, Yes… When I cough, I bring out some, some substance from my mouth, yes. So, what's the colour of the substance? Err, it's about, erm, it's clear. It's whitish, It's not, it's just normal. It's looking like saliva, but it's very thick. It's very thick. Was there blood in it, at any point? No, there was no blood in it. There was no blood in it. There was no blood in it at any point. Yes. And after you cough, do you feel like vomiting, or do you vomit? No, I don't. I don't. I don't feel like vomiting. I don't vomit at all. OK And you did not have catarrh or difficulty in swallowing prior to onset of the cough? No, no. There was nothing. I was not, I had nothing. My… my… even when I was coughing, my chest was not paining me nothing it was just the cough then I… I discovered after a few days after that I just started running temperature too. My body was very, very hot. It was very hot that I was shivering. So, you're telling me there is no, there is no cough, there is no chest pain. No, there's… there's no chest pain, my chest was not paining me at all. Your chest was not paining me. Is there anybody coughing around you? No, there nobody. I stay alone right now so I have nobody around me. I don't stay with people, so I don't have anybody around me that's coughing too. And at work too there's nobody coughing around me. So, OK, so you stay alone. You're not here in an overcrowded place. Yes, but yes. But Doctor, I noticed. What actually prompted me to come is the fact that about two days ago I noticed that the cough became worsened, and I was… I started to have some difficulty in breathing. So, like that got me really scared, like I was, I was, I was just feeling breathless for a moment. Comes and goes then, and since that, since then, the breathlessness has become more worsened. So that's what exactly prompted me to completely to see you. You're finding it difficult to breathe, Yes, Yes When you sleep at night, you sweat excessively. No, at all. I don't, I don't slept… I don't sweat when I sleep at night? OK, so what's what relieves the breathlessness? Any change in position that relieves the breathlessness or it’s constant? No, it's not associated with erm, any… any position, nothing. I just… it just comes and goes, like I just feel breathless for a while, then it relieves me. Then it comes again, especially when I'm especially when I'm coughing. OK. Has this worsened progressively? Yes, Yes… It has gotten very bad, doctor, that's why I came to the hospital. Does it affect, does it affect your daily activities? Yes, it does, doctor. I've not been able to work for the past two days because of the cough and the fact that I have, I've not been feeling well, generally in my body, so that's so, Now this fever that you were having, was it… did it start suddenly or gradually? It started. It started gradually, then became I became very hot and it has been like that, it has been like that. So, the fever is high grade, You're very hot? Yes… Yes, it's high. Did you at any point? Yes. Check by yourself at home your temperature? Yes, I did… I did, I have a thermometer, it was about was about 38.9. 38.9 OK and what does… what do you do that relieves the fever. I took some, I took some paracetamol. It relieved a bit, then but it did… didn't last long. I just I I became hot again and it has been like that ever since. So I just want to ask you some questions. Has anything happened before in the past? OK, Has it happened in the past? No, no, no, no. This is the first time I'm experiencing, that's why I'm… this is the first time I'm experiencing this kind of thing. OK, this is the first time. Are you.. do you have any medical condition? Like, are you asthmatic during your blood group and genotype? No, I'm not doctor, I'm fine. No, I have nothing. And that’s why this is Surprising. Are you hypertensive? What did you say? I can't hear you properly, Sir. Are you hypertensive or diabetic? None. None. None. None No, no. I have none of them… I have none of them. So, what have you... what have you done to care for yourself so far? I just… I just… I just tried to get some cough syrup, but they didn't… They didn't seem to work properly. They didn't seem to work and since the difficulty breathing started, I knew, I knew, I know I needed to like, come to speak to someone, to a doctor. So, that's why I came today, for you to like, for me to like, know what's wrong with me and treat myself, basically. Have you been, have you been admitted before? No, not, not, not that I can remember. Have you done any surgical procedure before? No, No. OK. So, I'm just going to ask you some other questions just to know what exactly could be related to your, to the symptoms you're having. So, do you have headache? Headache just comes once in a while, maybe 'cause the cough. I've not been able to sleep really. So, kind of, yeah, kind of, yes. OK. So, any loss of consciousness? No. No. No, No. OK, OK. Do you have Catarrh? No, at all. OK. Do you have any abdominal pain? No. No, I don't have any. Diarrhea or vomiting? No, I've not vomited at all. You have any bone pain? Yes. No, the no, the most. It's just, it's just the shortest of breath I've been having. The difficulty in breathing I've been having. That's just, that's just… So, in summary you're telling me, in summary you're telling me you had, you… you've had cough, fever and difficulty in breathing. Yes. Right and your cough is productive. Yes. All right, So I'm going to have to have to examine you, right. I'm going to have to examine you and I'm going to have to listen to your chest to know if, to know whatever is going on in your chest, whether there's a chest infection that is causing you to have a fever and the and the cough. Do you understand? And then we are going to have you do some investigations like a chest X-ray, a complete blood count, a full blood count which will tell us whether there's an infection going on, depending on the parameters that are elevated or reduced, do you understand? We are going to do you know, electrocyte segmentation rates to know whether there's an inflammatory process going on. Do you understand? And then we're also going to take your sputum, your… the phlegm and we're going to send it for culture, sensitivity to know what bacteria is, is being cultured. Erm, please, I just want to ask you, do you smoke? No. No, I don't, doctor, I'm a good Christian. I don’t smoke. I don't drink. You don't… You don't drink alcohol either. I don't, I don't do any of those, I don't do drugs, I don't do any of that. I'm going to ask you some other questions. Do you have… their kind of personal questions? Can I go ahead? Yeah. I just want to know, doctor, I just want to… I just want to be fine. I just want to know how soon you can start treating me and what I’ll need to take basically. I just want to ask if…I just want to ask if you have multiple sexual partners and then your sexual practices. No, no. You have oral sex? I'm married. No, not at all. Not at all. I'm married. So, we are going to start you, from the history and the examination we have done and then we're going to ask you to do some investigations. However, we have some differentials like diagnosis, the cause, the cause of what is causing the cough and the fever. We have some, this thing at the back of our mind, which could be the cause. Do you understand? We think you have a pneumonia, pneumonia, a chest infection. So, we're going to start you on a broad spectrum antibiotics, right? And then we're going to start you on the cough syrup, right, to treat the cough while we wait for the results of our investigations. Do you understand? OK And then since there's no history of asthma by the time you'll start treatment with the antibiotics and… and the cough syrup there will be… the breathlessness is going to reduce. But we… your... we would have checked your… your oxygen saturation and we'll see that it is fine. So, there'll be no need to place you on… on oxygen. So, you're going to have you do a full blood count in sputum and microscopy culture sensitivity. You're going to have you do any Erythrocyte segmentation rate and you're going to do a chest X-ray. So, let's see if it's a structural problem or a functional problem. Do you understand? OK, doctor. So doctor, do I.. Do you want to ask the question if you have any questions, Yes, I was going to ask that are you going to keep me in the hospital or do I… that… can I… can I be treated from home? Because I don't know. We, we, we are going to admit you for some time to evaluate you and because of the breathlessness you are having, right. And then we'll start you on on intravenous, intravenous… erm That's OK. That's cool. Culture and sensitivity could take about 72 hours to.. to five days before it will be ready. Do you understand? Yeah, no problem, Doctor. Thank you. No problem, Doctor. Thank you very much. I think that's fine. I will just, yeah, I'll just do the labs and wait for just for you to start the treatment. Thank you.",

[DEL:you] [DEL:you] have had cough fever and difficulty in breathing yes right and your cough is productive yes all right so i am going to have to [DEL:have] [DEL:to] examine you right i am going to have to examine you and i am going to have to listen to your chest to know [DEL:if] [DEL:to] [DEL:know] whatever is going on in your chest whether [SUB:there->it] is a chest infection that is causing you to have a fever and [SUB:the->a] [DEL:and] [DEL:the] cough do you understand and then we are going to have you do some investigations like a chest xray a complete blood count a full blood count which will tell us whether there is an infection going on depending on the parameters that are elevated or reduced do you understand we are going to do [SUB:you->ifide] [DEL:know] [DEL:electrocyte] segmentation rates to know whether there is an inflammatory process going on do you understand and then we are also going to take your sputum your [SUB:the->deflame] [DEL:phlegm] and we are going to send it for culture sensitivity to know what bacteria is [DEL:is] being cultured please i just want to ask you do you smoke no no i do not [DEL:doctor] i am a good christian i do not smoke i do not drink you do not [DEL:you] [DEL:do] [DEL:not] drink alcohol either i do not [SUB:i->drink] [DEL:do] [DEL:not] [DEL:do] any of those i do not do drugs i do not [SUB:do->drink] any of that i am going to

[SUB:married->free] so we are going to start you from the history and the examination [SUB:we->you] have done and then [SUB:we->i] [SUB:are->am] going to ask you to do some investigations however we have some [INS:different] [SUB:differentials->house] like diagnosis [SUB:the->because] [SUB:because->what] the [SUB:because->cost] of what is causing the cough and the fever we have some [SUB:this->just] [SUB:thing->in] [DEL:at] the back of our mind which could be the because [DEL:do] you understand [SUB:we->you] think you have a pneumonia pneumonia [DEL:a] chest infection so we are going to start you on [SUB:a->the] [SUB:broad->blood] spectrum antibiotics right and then we are going to start [SUB:you->your] [DEL:on] [DEL:the] cough [SUB:syrup->serum] right to treat the cough while we wait for the results of our investigations do you understand okay and then since there is no history of asthma by the time you [SUB:will->start] start treatment with the antibiotics and [DEL:and] the cough syrup [DEL:there] [DEL:will] [DEL:be] the breathlessness is going to reduce but we [DEL:your] [DEL:we] would have checked your [DEL:your] oxygen saturation and we [DEL:will] see that it is fine so there will be no need to place you on [DEL:on] oxygen so [SUB:you->we] are going to have you do a full blood count [SUB:in->a] sputum and [SUB:microscopy->microscop] [SUB:culture->contrast] sensitivity you are going to have you do [SUB:any->an] [SUB:erythrocyte->ultrasound] segmentation rate and you are going to do a chest xray so let us see if it is a structural problem or a functional problem do you understand okay doctor [SUB:so->okay] [DEL:doctor] [DEL:do] [DEL:i] [DEL:do] you want to ask [INS:me] [SUB:the->a] question [SUB:if->do] you have any

They didn't seem to work and since the difficulty in breathing started, I knew I needed to speak to someone, to a doctor, so that's why I came today. For you to know what's wrong with me and treat myself basically. Have you been admitted before? No, not that I can remember. Have you done any surgical procedure before? No. Okay, so I'm just going to ask you some other questions just to know what exactly could be related to the symptoms you're having. So, do you have a headache? Headache?

So, in summary, you're telling me you've had cough, fever, and difficulty in breathing. Yes. Right. And your cough is productive. Yes. All right. So I'm going to have to examine you. Right. I'm going to have to examine you. And I'm going to have to listen to your chest to know whatever is going on in your chest, whether it's a chest infection that is causing you to have a fever and a cough. Do you understand? And then we are going to have you do some investigations like a chest x-ray, a complete blood count, a full blood count, which will tell us whether there's an infection going on depending on the parameters that are elevated or reduced. Do you understand? We are going to do um, ifide segmentation rates to know whether there's an inflammatory process going on. Do you understand?

But we would have checked your oxygen saturation, and we see that it is fine. So there will be no need to place you on oxygen. So we are going to have you do a full blood count, a sputum, and microscop contrast sensitivity. You are going to have you do an ultrasound segmentation rate, and you are going to do a chest x-ray. So let's see if it is a structural problem or a functional problem. Do you understand? Okay, doctor. Okay. You want to ask me a question? Do you have any question? question yes i was going to ask that i'm able to keep me in your speech or do i can i can i be treated from home because i don't know we we are going to um admit you uh for some time to evaluate you because because of the breathlessness you're having, right?
