    "human_transcript": "D: How can I uh, help you today?\n\nP: Hi, so I just came in today because I've been just been feeling um, like my head's just been hurting for the past three or four days and I also felt really cold throughout the day for the last few days as well, so, um, I did end up checking my temperature just yesterday afternoon and it was um, 38.7 degrees celsius.\n\nD: Okay, um. Tell me about the headache, where exactly is it? \n\nP: Yeah so it's kind of just throughout like the front of my forehead and it kind of goes to the side into my temple. \n\nD: And what does it feel like?\n\nP: It feels like a constant aching. I've had uh, migraines before, but they like, it's not like the pulsating sensation that I usually get with them.\n\nD: I see. Uh, okay, and how severe is the pain, if you had to rate it from 1 to 10?\n\nP: Um, more than like severe. It's definitely less severe than my migraines, but it, it's just constant. It's, it's just been there for the last four days and I would say probably a 6 out of 10.\n\nD: Did you do anything for the pain? Did you take any medications? Anything that makes it better?\n\nP: Yeah, I took a Tylenol, I took um, Advil. It helps for like a few hours and then it just comes back.\n\nD: And anything that makes the pain worse?\n\nP: Um, I definitely think just, if I rest, it's better if, but if I'm like, like I can't, I can't concentrate on work or like anything.\n\nD: Okay. Um, and other than the, um, the fever and headaches, have you um, had any um, cough?\n\nP: No, no cough. \n\nD: Runny nose or congestion?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Sore throat?\n\nP: No, not really.\n\nD: Changes in your sense of smell?\n\nP: Uh, I do actually feel like I, like I am losing my smell today.\n\nD: And sense of taste?\n\nP: I just had breakfast today so um, breakfast was okay. I didn't, uh, but yeah, definitely sense of smell.\n\nD: Okay, and any difficulties breathing?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Okay, any chest pain?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Um, do you feel like your heart is racing?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: Any diarrhea or constipation?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Nausea or vomiting?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Pain in your belly?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: Any muscle aches or joint pains?\n\nP: Uh, no, nothing like that.\n\nD: Okay, um, do you feel like your neck is stiff?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: Any numbness or tingling in your arms or fingers, or toes?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: Any um, night sweats or weight loss, unintentional?\n\nP: No, I've only been gaining weight.\n\nD: Okay. Any fluid in your, any sort of, swelling in your legs?\n\nP: No, nothing like that really.\n\nD: Okay, um, any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?\n\nP: Yes, so I have uh, type 2 diabetes. I was just recently started on metformin medication.\n\nD: When were you started on metformin?\n\nP: So I think around uh, it's been around two months.\n\nD: Okay, how is that going for you? Are you tolerating it okay?\n\nP: Yeah I've, I've been tolerating it well. It's just they, they said like I'm kind of just on the edge of the diabetes, like my level, so they just want to act, um, proactively.\n\nD: Yeah, that's good. Um, any other medical conditions?\n\nP: No, that's, that's all.\n\nD: Any medications other than metformin that you take? Anything over the counter?\n\nP: Um, so I do take, when my migraines get bad, like I do take, I have taken naproxen before. \n\nD: Okay. Surgeries?\n\nP: Uh, no surgeries.\n\nD: Hospitalizations?\n\nP: Uh no.\n\nD: Okay, any allergies to medications, foods, or any environmental allergies?\n\nP: Not to any medications, but I do have an allergy to peanuts.\n\nD: Okay, what happens? \n\nP: I do get like a, an anaphylactic reaction. \n\nD: Okay, okay. Um, and any um, family history of any medical conditions?\n\nP: Uh, so on my dad's side, they like all, like all the men seem to have diabetes, so it's good that I'm starting on the medication. Um on my mom's side, they're pretty healthy. I don't think my mom has any medical conditions.\n\nD: Okay, good. Um, and do you currently live alone or do you live with other people?\n\nP: Yeah, so I live with my wife, I live with my two kids, a son and daughter.\n\nD: And um, have you or any of them had any exposures to anyone who could possibly be sick?\n\nP: Um just, uh, so my wife is a school teacher, um, and they did have in-person. Just uh, she's a high school teacher, and they had some they have in-person classes. So yeah, I don't know, but she's been feeling well. My kids are feeling well too.\n\nD: Okay, and have you traveled anywhere outside the province?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Okay, and do you currently smoke or did you ever smoke in the past?\n\nP: No, I've never smoked. I do smoke marijuana just, maybe once or twice a month with some friends.\n\nD: Okay, any recreational drugs? \n\nP: Sorry, no. \n\nD: Um, any alcohol?\n\nP: Yeah, I probably drink um, a couple of beers during the weekend.\n\nD: Okay, got it. Um, alright. Well, given your symptoms, um, we would like to do a COVID swab, just in, or request a COVID swab to be done through public health, um, just to, just to rule it out. Your symptoms do sound like, or overlap with some of the symptoms that are seen in patients who do have COVID. It could be that you have um, just um, just I guess like your headache and fever. Um, I'll also like do a physical exam to see there's nothing else going on. But in the meantime, I, I'd like you to self isolate and stay away from the rest of your family members as well, um, at least until the results are out. And then when the results are out, if it's positive, you'll receive more guidelines from public health as to what you need to do.\n\nP: Okay, sounds good, um, and I work from home, so I don't need to.\n\nD: Oh that's good. Okay, so you work from home. \n\nP: Alright.\n\nD: Good.\n\nP: Thank you.",

    "human_transcript": "D: What brings you in here today? \n\nP: Yeah hi, I'm I I have a pain in my belly. It started a couple hours ago.\n\nD: OK, and where exactly in your belly do you have this pain?\n\nP: It's mostly up here on the right side.\n\nD: The right side, OK and can you describe what kind of pain is it? Is it like a dull pain or sharp pain, an aching pain? \n\nP: Oh I guess it's a, it's an aching pain I'd say. It kind of just, um, it would initially just come and go, but now it's just it's staying. It's not going away.\n\nD: OK, and so it's in the right area and does it travel anywhere elsewhere besides on from the right side?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK. And on a scale of 1 to 10, one being the least amount of pain you felt in your life, and 10 being the worst, how much would you rate it right now?\n\nP: It's about to a 10, an 8 maybe.\n\nD: An 8, OK and so just to clarify, when did it start?\n\nP: About 8 hours ago.\n\nD: 8 hours ago, OK. And were you doing anything before? Like, did you have a meal or how were you sleeping before it woke you up, what was going on before you had the pain?\n\nP: I was just about to go to sleep. I wasn't doing anything in particular at the time.\n\nD: OK. And has it been getting worse since it first started?\n\nP: Oh yeah, definitely it would come and go, but now for the past I'd say five to six hours, it's been constant, just there all the time. \n\nD: OK. And have you had any similar pain like this in the past?\n\nP: Yeah, uh I I have the same pain that sort of comes and goes after I eat. Usually after I've had something like a something fatty, something from outdoors, maybe like a burger or fries or something. I initially thought it was indigestion, but I don't I don't know what's going on now.\n\nD: OK, and does it, does anything make it better or worse or anything that you've tried?\n\nP: Well, I guess eating sometimes makes it worse, um, but I don't I don't think there's anything that's making it better.\n\nD: OK, have you tried any medications at all?\n\nP: I tried Tylenol but that didn't do anything.\n\nD: OK. And besides, uh, the pain that you're having, do you have any nausea and vomiting?\n\nP: I am a little nauseous, but no, I didn't, haven't had I haven't vomited yet, no.\n\nD: OK, and have you been having any fevers?\n\nP: I don't think so. I haven't checked. I don't feel feverish.\n\nD: Any sweats or like chills?\n\nP: No,  I don't think so.\n\nD: OK, any changes in your bowel movements like constipation, diarrhea?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK. Have you traveled anywhere recently?\n\nP: No, I haven't. \n\nD: Have you been feeling at all, very tired, not your usual self, fatigued?\n\nP: Well the pain is making it difficult for me to do things, um, but I I guess I'm not, uh a little fatigued  maybe.\n\nD: OK. Um, have you been having any changes in your urinary patterns? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: No? Any changes in your skin and you rashes, any yellowing of your skin?\n\nP: Nothing that I've noticed, no, I don't think so. \n\nD: OK. Any changes in your urine color?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK, have you noticed blood in your stools at all?\n\nP: I have not, no.\n\nD: OK, and how about your appetite, has this changed at all?\n\nP: Well, I guess because it's this thing happens usually happens after I eat, I think I've been eating less than usual, just because I don't, I don't want to, you know, I don't like the pain.\n\nD: Any significant weight loss recently?\n\nP: I don't think so.\n\nD: OK, any recent infections recently at all?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: Um, and otherwise are you, do you have any other medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure or anything else?\n\nP: I do have diabetes but that's about it I think.\n\nD: And you take anything for your diabetes?\n\nP: I take metformin.\n\nD: OK, um do you take any other medications at all? \n\nP: No, I don't, sorry, no. \n\nD: No worries. Do you have any allergies to any medications, any environmental allergies?\n\nP: No no, no, I don't. \n\nD: OK. And have you been hospitalized in the past?\n\nP: No, no I haven't ever. I've been very uh healthy. No hospitalizations. \n\nD: Any past surgeries?\n\nP: I got my wisdom teeth removed when I was a teenager. \n\nD: OK. Have you been in contact with anyone who has been ill recently?\n\nP: No, I don't think so. \n\nD: OK. Hmm, and in terms of your family history, has anyone had any cancers or um any err um IBD like Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis?\n\nP: No, not that I know of. \n\nD: OK. And anything that runs in the family at all?\n\nP: My dad had a heart attack when he was in his 60s. But that's it. \n\nD: OK. And um, currently right now do you work?\n\nP: Oh no, I'm I'm laid off because of COVID.\n\nD: OK. And currently, what is your home situation like?\n\nP: What do you mean?\n\nD: So do you live in an apartment, house and do you live with anyone?\n\nP: I I I live in an apartment, I live alone.\n\nD: Um, and in terms of your daily routine, do you feel that you get enough exercise? Do you go outside for walks or runs or anything like that?\n\nP: I usually go out for a run, especially when it's a little bit warmer, which it now is. \n\nD: And do you do you drink alcohol? \n\nP: Uh, sometimes.\n\nD: How much would you say you drink in an average week?\n\nP: One to two drinks a day.\n\nD: OK, and what do you usually drink?\n\nP: I'll just drink a glass of wine at night, just helps me relax. \n\nD: OK. And do you smoke cigarettes?\n\nP: I don't, no. \n\nD: OK. And do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana?\n\nP: No, I don't. \n\nD: OK. Alright, so um, that's all the questions I have and just to clarify, does your pain come and go, or is it constant?\n\nP: Yes, so initially it would come and go, but now, so for the first 2 hours it would come and go. And when I would have this pain when I was eating, it would come and go. But over the past six hours it's just been constant. \n\nD: OK. Alright.",

    "human_transcript": "D: What brings you in today?\n\nP: Yeah, I've had a shortness of breath, and even at at rest. Really, feeling like it's difficult to breathe, and when I take a deep breath I get a chest pain.\n\nD: When did this start?\n\nP: This started yesterday.\n\nD: How bad is your shortness of breath?\n\nP: Like, I don't know. I feel like I'm OK, like n terms of being able to breathe, but I mean if I exert myself at all, there's no way I would be able to. It's, I just feel like even at rest it's hard to breathe.\n\nD: OK, has it gotten worse since yesterday or better, or kind of been the same?\n\nP: It's mostly been that been the same or actually sorry it's got, got a little bit worse at first. It was more more with exertion, and now it's, at rest as well. So yeah, it's got worse. \n\nD: I see, OK. Are you able to talk in full sentences or do you need to take a deep like stop to take a breath?\n\nP: I could talk in full sentences. \n\nD: And the chest pain, does it only occur when you take a deep breath, or are there other times as well?\n\nP: I pretty much yeah only when I'm taking a deep breath and say, I mean, maybe that's why part of the I can't take a deep breath so it's making me feel it's making the breathing more difficult making me feel more short of breath. \n\nD: OK. Any other symptoms that you've had? A fever or headache?\n\nP: No, nothing like that. \n\nD: Any cough? \n\nP: Yeah, I, I've had a cough as well over that the same same time period.\n\nD: Is it a dry cough? Are you bringing something up?\n\nP: It's dry, yeah, I haven't brought up any sputum or any any any blood.\n\nD: OK any other flu like symptoms, runny nose, stuffy nose, sore throat? Anything like that?\n\nP: No, I just had um, yeah, the shortness of breath and chest pain.\n\nD: OK, uhm. And have you, I guess I just invited more general questions about others potential symptoms. Do you feel like your heart is racing or do you feel like you have, uhm, do you have any belly pain or any changes in your bowel movements?\n\nP: No belly pain or changes to bowel movements, but I do feel like my heart is beating really fast really fast though.\n\nD: Yeah, OK. Uhm, you said this started yesterday. Were you like completely fine the day before?\n\nP: Uh I was yeah. \n\nD: Anything that's happened recently that's different or new?\n\nP: I'm well it like uh, about two weeks ago I had a hysterectomy 'cause I, for abnormal bleeding. Yeah I had surgery 2 weeks ago.\n\nD: What have you been doing these past two weeks in terms of sort of physical activity? Have you been moving around or no?\n\nP: It's it's certainly been less I I've been moving a little bit, but I've had a lot of pain so I just haven't been doing as much activity, that's for sure.\n\nD: I I see and have you had any, I guess any pain in your legs. Or swelling in your leg? One or the other?\n\nP: Yeah, I have had actually, yeah my right my right calf is pretty sore. \n\nD: Definitely have a look at that. Have you noticed that it's been bigger or more red or warm? \n\nP: Um, no, I don't notice anything like that, just I, just really hurts. \n\nD: Uh, OK. Any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?\n\nP: Um, yeah, yeah and I have a high BMI. Type 2 diabetes and anxiety.\n\nD: Do you have any bleeding disorders?\n\n\nP: Um other yeah, no. I think you're right. It said fibroids.\n\nD: OK, OK. And do you take any medication?\n\nP: Yeah, so uh insulin, well metformin. And then that's it. \n\nD: OK.\n\nP: I'm sorry and then an SSRI. Like I said, low pram for anxiety. \n\nD: Alright. And do you have any allergies?\n\nP: No, I don't.\n\nD: And, who do you.. do you currently live alone?\n\nP: Uh no, I live with my husband and and our two sons. \n\nD: OK and, do you, have anyone sort of come in to help you out over these past two weeks? Are you getting any outside help from nurses etc. Or are your are your family members being supportive and helpful? \n\nP: Yeah, it's been mostly the the family members. My husband's been working from home and the kids have been helpful as well. They are 10 and 12 so they are able to do some things on their own so yeah they've been supportive.\n\nD: That's great. That's great. OK, and you smoke at all?\n\nP: I do yes I I smoke about a half a pack per day. \n\nD: For how long?\n\nP: Um, yeah, but I I started in my, yeah, after the kids were born actually, uh so like 10 years ago.\n\nD: OK, have you tried cutting it down at all? \n\nP: Yeah, I have. I've kind of gone through spurts of quitting and restarting, quitting and restarting. So yeah, I've tried before.\n\nD: OK, and what about marijuana or recreational drugs?\n\nP: No, don't use anything like that.\n\nD: And alcohol? \n\nP: Yeah I'll have some wine on the on the weekends, but maybe that's like a glass or two.\n\nD: OK, OK uhm, and do you have any medical conditions that long run in the family?\n\nP: Just, uh, yeah, my father actually had a stroke when he was 68, and that's it.\n\nD: OK OK uhm. You haven't ever had one, have you?\n\nP: No, I I haven't had anything like that. \n\nD: OK, alright. So. I guess come to in terms of smoking, you said that you've tried to quit a couple of times in the past. Do you intend on trying again? I know it can be very hard to, to quit smoking.\n\nP: Yeah, it's only something that is always kind of in the back of my mind.\n\nD: OK, if there's I'm happy to assist you and share resources and problems like medications and things like that that could help you if you're interested so we can talk more about that. talking about your I guess you mentioned that your weight is a little higher than or, its outside the normal range, is that something that you would like to cut down?\n\nP: Yeah, I really try to eat more vegetables and have been trying to do that sort of thing. I've lost a few pounds, but not enough, definitely want to keep going.\n\nD: OK, good good, as long as you feel that you what you're currently doing is helping you and is helping you reduce weight. That's great. But also I'm here for you if you need more education or guidance on that. So, given what you've told me so far, it sounds like you might have developed a clot in your leg somewhere, simply because you had a surgery and you were not moving around very much. Sometimes that causes the blood to kind of, not move around your body is as as much as it usually does, and kind of stays in one place and get turned into a clot and that clot can sometimes get dislodged and settle into your lungs, and that can make it difficult for you to breathe. So, we'll do some tests that that's what my understanding is. Given what you've told me so far, but we do have to confirm it using a test. Also, the fact that you smoke and your weight, and your BMI is high, increases your risk of developing a clot, so I would definitely strongly recommend that you continue to try to reduce both and try to quit smoking. And so we'll do an ultrasound of your leg and we'll do a scan of your chest and see what's going on and then decide if we need to give you any medications, like any blood thinning medications.\n\nP: OK, yeah, that sounds really good. Thank you.\n\nD: Welcome.",

Any allergies, either to medications or environmental?\n\nP: Um, I'm allergic to penicillin.\n\nD: To penicillin, okay. And what kind of reaction do you get to penicillin?\n\nP: Um, I was told that I got a rash when I was a child.

Or are they, are they fine?\n\nP: Well, my daughter doesn't have any symptoms anymore. She did as I mentioned, have some flu like symptoms 2 weeks ago. My wife's been healthy.\n\nD: Okay, and uh, does your daughter go to school right now or is she doing school from home?\n\nP: Uh, school from home.\n\nD: School from home, okay. Um, and do you at all smoke? So you mentioned your symptoms get worse with smoking.\n\nP: Yeah. \n\nD: Um, how much would you say you smoke on an average day?\n\nP: Um, I don't, I try, I've been trying to cut down, so I, I smoke about 3 or 4 cigarettes a week. I used to smoke a lot more before.\n\nD: Wow, yeah, that's really good! That's really great progress, um, it's really difficult to quit, but it's great to see that you're trying to quit. Um, so how much would you say you used to smoke?\n\nP: Well, half a pack. Um, half a pack a day, but then over the past three years I've been trying to cut it down. I started smoking when I was 20, so it's been um, 30 years now.\n\nD: Okay, so 30 years, okay. And um, are you just, are you using anything to help you quit smoking or are you doing it without any medications, or um, like, have you used anything in the past that has worked for you?\n\nP: Um, no I, I went to my doc and he said to try on my own first and if I'm struggling with it to come back, but I've been doing it very gradually so it's, it's going well.\n\nD: Okay, and that's really good. And yeah, if you, at all, need any resources to help you quit smoking, it's great that you're doing really well, but if you need to talk more about it or need any more resources we can provide that for you. Um, other than uh, smoking cigarettes, do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana at all?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: No. How about alcohol?\n\nP: Uh, I just drink on the weekends. Maybe a glass or two of wine.\n\nD: Okay, and uh yeah. So those were kind of all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions or concerns?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: No?\n\nP: I was, I guess I was just worried about the cough um, it's just, I was worried that it could be COVID.\n\nD: Yeah, so definitely right now, any of these symptoms, like COVID can have a lot of different symptoms um, so we should definitely make sure that we, to check if you have COVID or not and we'll get a COVID swab test done for you today, and the results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. Uh, and in that time, you will need to isolate even in your own home. Try to wear a mask around your family members, um, trying to eat separately and use all those methods, and, and then after the test comes back you may, you'll be contacted by public health if it's positive and kind of given more instruction on what to do. And it doesn't necessarily have to be COVID either, it can be just another virus uh, like it can be just your common cold that's been going on. So it does seem that your symptoms have gotten better. Oftentimes uh, a cough can be the last thing to go, it can take up to two weeks or more for the cough to get relieved, but it seems that you're not having any systemic symptoms like no fevers or anything else right now, so it's, it's uh, that's, that's pretty good.\n\nP: Great, I'm glad. \n\nD: Alright, yeah.\n\nP: Thank you.\n\nD: You're welcome. Take care.",

    "human_transcript": "D: What brings you in?\n\nP: Yeah, I'm just coming in with my son, he's been having, he's been complaining of just, seems like pain in his right ear for the last I would say three to four days. And it seems like he's just more irritable, just not himself right now.\n\nD: Yeah OK, so, how long did you say he's had this ear pain?\n\nP: I would say four days now. \n\nD: Four days, OK. Have you noticed any hearing loss? \n\nP: Uh, no, he still responds when I call his name.\n\nD: OK and, have you noticed any fluid coming out of his ears?\n\nP: Uh, no, I don't think so.\n\nD: Is it more like one side of his ears or is it both ears?\n\nP: It's just his right ear.\n\nD: Just his right ear, OK. And have you noticed that it's like, swollen, red or warm?\n\nP: Uh, no, I don't see any swelling or redness at all.\n\nD: OK, OK, good, and have you taken a look inside his ears?\n\nP: Yeah, I tried to take a look with a flashlight. I couldn't really see too much.\n\nD: OK, yeah, that's fair. And you mentioned he's had a runny nose too, When did that start?\n\nP: Yeah, so that, kind of like last week he was recovering from, I think it was just a cold and he had a runny nose and just was a bit congested. But then over the last week it kind of just resolved. But then this week he started having just this ear pain.\n\nD: OK. Any fevers? \n\nP: Uh, no, not that I, I haven't measured anything and he hasn't mentioned any, like he hasn't felt cold or anything like that.\n\nD: OK, any weight loss over the past month or so?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: No, any change in his hair or nails, like rashes or, sorry, or skin?\n\nP: Yeah, no, I haven't seen any changes in the skin.\n\nD: OK, any changes in his vision or smell or taste?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: No, OK. His runny nose, what color is it?\n\nP: It was mainly, uh, it seemed to me like it was mainly clear when it was happening, like he wasn't bringing up any yellow or green material.\n\nD: OK, good. Does he have a sore throat at all?\n\nP: No, not that he's told me. He's still eating things and I don't think he's having any trouble with eating anything, so I don't think so.\n\nD: OK, that's good. Has he had a cough?\n\nP: Uhm, actually he did. He did start coughing like yesterday, but just a few times a day. I don't know if it's because of this or like, what else might be going on.\n\nD: OK, and you said for the past few days, he's had the cough?\n\nP: Yeah, I think just maybe started yesterday.\n\nD: Started yesterday, OK. Is it a dry cough or is it, is he bringing up any phlegm?\n\nP: No, it seems to be just dry. I think I just noticed it like three or four times during the day yesterday.\n\nD: OK, so no blood that he's bringing up right?\n\nP: No, no.\n\nD: OK, and does he have any shortness of breath?\n\nP: No, no.\n\nD: No, OK, any wheezing?\n\nP: No, no wheezing. \n\nD: No chest pain?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, uhm, any nausea or vomiting?\n\nP: No nausea or vomiting.\n\nD: Any changes to his bowel movements?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: No, OK and, how about urine, is that normal?\n\nP: Yeah, Uh, no changes at all.\n\nD: Any headaches? \n\nP: Not that he's told me about.\n\nD: OK, dizziness or fainting spells?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Feeling like he's off balance or lost coordination?\n\nP: No, I don't think so.\n\nD: No, OK, no numbness, no tingling?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Has he had any contacts with sick people recently?\n\nP: Uhm, no, I don't think anyone's been sick around him.\n\nD: OK and has he traveled to anywhere recently?\n\nP: Uh, no, like, he's mainly just been inside his home. \n\nD: OK. has he ever had ear pain before?\n\nP: He did have a similar pain, I think when he was like around three years old, but it happened with his left left ear, not the right one.\n\nD: OK, was he prescribed any medications?\n\nP: Uh yeah, he was given a, like a course of antibiotics at that time. I forgot what it was called, but I think at that time it was much worse, like he, I don't know if he was just younger and couldn't tolerate it but I think he also had a fever at that time.\n\nD: OK, OK, and then any other ear infections outside of that one time.\n\nP: No, I think that, only that one I can recall.\n\nD: OK, alright, is he otherwise healthy?\n\nP: Yeah, otherwise he's healthy. No, other conditions or anything like that.\n\nD: No hospitalizations or surgeries? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: And is he on any medications?\n\nP: No medications. \n\nD: OK, is he up to date with all his immunizations?\n\nP: Yeah, all his immunizations are good.\n\nD: OK, any allergies?\n\nP: Not that we know of so far.\n\nD: And any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions.\n\nP: No lung or heart conditions. Just, his father does have like celiac disease, so I don't know if that's related at all.\n\nD: OK, how old was he when was diagnosed with celiac?\n\nP: Fairly young I would say, in his 20s.\n\nD: OK, OK, uhm, alright, we'll keep an eye on it in him, like if he has any changes in his bowel movements or if he's getting severe abdominal pain after eating certain foods with gluten you can get him checked up for that as well.\n\nP: OK. \n\nD: Yeah and then, in terms of where he lives, does he live with you and your partner?\n\nP: Yeah, so it's just, he's an only child, lives with me and my husband, and also we have like a pet dog.\n\nD: OK, do you live in an apartment or in a house?\n\nP: We live in a, it's like a condominium.\n\nD: OK, OK, any old carpet, mold or asbestos in the building?\n\nP: No, no, nothing like that. It's fairly well kept. \n\nD: OK, And is he other-wise like developmental-wise, he's OK? There's no past history of like developmental disorders, anything like that?\n\nP: No, no issues from like when he was younger like no complaints at all. I Think he was doing the same as every other child.\n\nD: OK, no complications during your pregnancy with him, no complications during the actual delivery and then when he was a newborn?\n\nP: Uh no, no complications, it was just a vaginal birth at 39 weeks and we didn't need to stay in the hospital at all afterwards.\n\nD: OK, good. So those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?\n\nP: Yeah, I don't know if, uh, like last time we did get some antibiotics. I don't know if he needs them right now or what would you recommend?\n\nD: Yeah, uhm so I'm gonna have to take a look into his ears first before I can come up with like a management plan for him. So once I do, if I see, uhm, if his tympanic membrane has been perforated or I see pus in there, we'll prescribe him like 10 days of antibiotics. We can give him either Amoxicillin, or if he has bad reactions to penicillins,  we can give him Cefuroxime and then if, uh, it doesn't seem to have any systemic symptoms, so if he has systemic symptoms like fever, which we'll check for today, and if he's like been really ill and he has like a middle ear effusion or bulging tympanic membrane, again we'll give him antibiotics for 10 days. But if his tympanic membrane is just bulging a little bit, or if he has some middle ear effusion but no systemic symptoms, like, no fevers, and he seems to be fine otherwise, we'll reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see if he's better and if he's not, again, will prescribe him antibiotics. How does that sound?\n\nP: Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you.\n\nD: OK yeah, no worries.",

Anything in particular that you're doing that makes it worse?\n\nP: Uhm, not really, it's kind of, I just feel like, it's just more difficult to breathe, uh, most of the time. \n\nD: And, has this happened to you before?\n\nP: Uhm, not like, no, nothing like this has happened before. \n\nD: OK, do you have a history of any lung problems?\n\nP: No, I don't, I've been healthy.\n\nD: So no COPD, no asthma, nothing like that,  right?\n\nP: No, nothing like that.\n\nD: OK, so you're just having difficulties breathing for the past three-four days. Do you have any, uh, do you have a cough?\n\nP: I did have a, uh, yeah, I've had a cough as well, over these last few days.\n\nD: And has it been a dry cough or wet cough?\n\nP: I've been bringing up, some, like, uh, whitish sputum. It's like, yeah, whitish or clear.\n\nD: And you haven't seen blood anytime right? In your sputum?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK, and has the cough gotten any worse overtime?\n\nP: Uh, it's been about the same.\n\nD: And have you had fevers or chills?\n\nP: I have felt hot but no chills.\n\nD: OK. What about, any redness in your eyes or any congestion in your nose?\n\nP: Uh, I haven't noticed anything like that.\n\nD: OK, have you had a sore throat?\n\nP: Uh, it's felt a little itchy I guess but no pain with swallowing.\n\nD: And do you have any chest pain or chest pressure?\n\nP: Yeah, when I like, uh, take a deep breath or after after I cough I've been having some chest pain.\n\nD: To give it a number from one to ten, what would you say in terms of how severe it is with ten being the worst pain ever.\n\nP: I would say, maybe six. It feels pretty sharp when it happens and it goes away after a few minutes.\n\nD: OK, and where exactly is it, is the pain?\n\nP: Uh yeah, I kind of feel it, Yeah, just over on the right side of the sternum. \n\nD: OK. Alright, and does it radiate anywhere? Does it go anywhere other than that one location?\n\nP: No, I feel it just in the one spot.\n\nD: OK, uhm, and has that pain gotten worse overtime?\n\nP: No, that pain started, I guess like two days ago. More recent than the cough or shortness of breath.\n\nD: I see, I see, OK. And so you said that coughing makes it worse and sometimes breathing in. So is it just normal breathing or when you're doing like, deep breathing?\n\nP: Deep breathing. \n\nD: Deep breathing hurts? OK. Alright, and you've never experienced this before, right?\n\nP: No, I haven't had a pain like this before.\n\nD: OK, when you sort of touch that area over your chest, does touching it make it worse?\n\nP: Uhm, no, I haven't noticed that, touching it doesn't make it worse.\n\nD: OK. Uhm, alright, have you had a headache? \n\nP: Uh, no.\n\nD: No, OK. What about fatigue or muscle aches?\n\nP: I've been fatigued.

So sounds like for the past three-four days you've had difficulties breathing and a cough with this whitish sputum, whitish or clear sputum. You've also been feeling a little bit feverish. Have you checked your temperature?\n\nP: No, I haven't. I don't have a thermometer at home.\n\nD: Yeah, no problem and your throat's been a little bit itchy and then two days ago you also started having this pain in your chest. Is there any other symptom that I have not mentioned that you have been experiencing over the past couple of days?\n\nP: No, that's everything. \n\nD: Yeah, OK. And you mentioned that you don't have a history of asthma or COPD. Do you have any other medical conditions?\n\nP: I have high blood pressure. And I take Amlodipine, for that.\n\nD: OK any other over the counter medications or any other medication that you're on?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Any allergies?\n\nP: No allergies.\n\nD: OK, and where do you currently live?\n\nP: In a townhouse just outside of the city here.\n\nD: I see, do you live alone?\n\nP: No, I live with my wife and daughter.\n\nD: And have your wife and daughter been sick recently or have either of you had contact with someone who's been sick?\n\nP: I've been working from home, uhm, but my daughter has recently started going back to high school and she's had a runny nose recently and a sore throat, but that's about it.\n\nD: And what about your wife?\n\nP: She's been fine. Yeah, she's been healthy.\n\nD: OK, good. Other than your daughter, have you been in contact with anyone else who might have, who might be sick or might have symptoms similar to what your daughter has?\n\nP: I don't think so. \n\nD: OK, alright, and do you, have you traveled anywhere recently?\n\nP: No, I've been just, uh, working from home.\n\nD: OK, and do you smoke? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: Ever smoked in the past?\n\nP: No, I've never smoked before.\n\nD: Marijuana?\n\nP: I mean, I'll have a joint sometimes with friends at a party or something, but that's maybe once a month?\n\nD: Sure, and any street drugs?\n\nP: Nope, nothing like that.\n\nD: OK, and do you drink alcohol?\n\nP: I have a beer a couple of times per week.\n\nD: Alright, and you told me about your medical history, but do you have, have you ever had any surgeries or any hospitalizations in the past?\n\nP: Uh, I've had a hernia repair, about seven years ago. I haven't had any issues since.\n\nD: Alright, OK, uhm, and are there any medical conditions that run in your family? \n\nP: Uhm, my grand-father had a heart attack, in his seventies. And, I think my dad has high blood pressure as well, but, I think that's it.\n\nD: Alright, well, so, I think that's all that I wanted to know.

    "human_transcript": "D: So I understand you removed insects from your leg earlier today?\n\nP: Yes I did, it was uh it was behind my left uh knee kind of in like the joint behind where it bends. Um it was stuck pretty good, it's still kind of red and tender there. I noticed it because the back of my knee was starting to just feel a bit sore, um not the joint itself, but just kind of the skin, the whole area back there. Um and I found this tick, I brought I brought it in with me if you wanted to have a look at it, um it's in like this little plastic container, uh and I don't really know when I got it. I was hiking on Friday um and then Saturday I was out in my garden, I hope they're not around my house, I hope that it was from hiking um and not gardening, but uh I did spend a lot of time outside on Saturday as well.\n\nD: OK, so sounds like it's been a little bit of time since you were last outdoors to when you first noticed it?\n\nP: Yeah.\n\nD: OK, so when you picked it off the tick, obviously you have it for me, is it quite swollen or engorged?\n\nP: It's not too bad, um I I have actually had a tick in the past and this is a long time ago and um maybe like 10 years and I actually had that kind of target rash thing that they talk about. And, uh at that time I remember I had to take antibiotics for a bit. Um this um didn't look like that, it was more, it was just kind of sore in one spot, I don't think it um it was as bad as that time and the tick that time, sorry I've kind of gotten off track, that time it was quite swollen, this one was maybe a little bit, but not as much.\n\nD: OK, so just in terms of the tick's size, it doesn't look like it's been feeding for too long, so when ticks uh are feeding they tend to engorge, they tend to swell up, so this looks more like a tiny little bug or does it kind of look like a little grape, almost like it's been swollen up with blood?\n\nP: No, this one, this one's pretty small.\n\nD: This one's pretty small, OK. And I should mention that, well obviously you've had a tick bite in the past, the big concern for us is a disease called Lyme disease, which is spread by bacteria, but in fact only one type of tick predominantly is a transmission transmitory agent for it. It's called a deer tick, and its coloration, it's got a little bit of a brown butt and there's some black legs. Does it look like that at all?\n\nP: I don't think so, uhm, I uh I was looking at the pictures online, I think it looks like the other kind of tick, um but I heard that, yeah, but I heard that lately now they've been considering all ticks in this area as possibly carriers of Lyme um because I think it's kind of become more more of a problem sm so that was making me a bit nervous.\n\nD: OK, absolutely, what we can do is we can send this tick off to the lab and they'll be able to identify the species for it, but for tick bites in general, one of the key considerations is for how long it's been on your body for. So unfortunately, if you're out on Friday and Saturday, that'd mean that this tick has been on you for longer than at least 72 hours. So I think one way or another, we're likely going to have to put you on antibiotics just as kind of a prophylactic at the very least, just want to make sure that um you're not at risk of developing Lyme disease. I'm sure you've heard from the news that Lyme disease can present in a variety of ways, but it's a disease that we try our best to avoid. And just in terms of your symptoms, so you say you've had a bite in the past and you you've got that rash before, that kind of bullseye rash, do you have that rash now?\n\nP: No, I don't uh as far as I know, I mean, you can have a look too. It's behind my knee, so it's not the easiest place to see, but it's uh it looks a little red, it's like tender where the tick was, but I don't see that like larger circle rash.\n\nD: OK, that's reassuring. Now any, it'd be pretty unlikely for you to have other symptoms, but just in case, do you have any other joint pain? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: Have you been feeling ill or have been feverish in the last little while?\n\nP: No, no, I've been fine.\n\nD: OK, and you removed that twit tick once you found it, you presented to me, have you checked your body for any other possible bites?\n\nP: Oh yeah, I looked around and I looked at my husband too 'cause we we were just a little bit, you know, gave us a little bit of a scare, but no, there's been nothing else.\n\nD: That's good. And did you bring a pet with you at all when you were hiking and gardening?\n\nP: Uh no, I didn't, no.\n\nD: OK, good. Any other family members you think might have been exposed?\n\nP: Uh no it was just uh me and my husband.\n\nD: OK, and what geographic area were you in um when you were hiking?\n\nP: We were uh in Strathroy along the creek.\n\nD: OK. I can do, if I remember there's a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario and we can see exactly how that lines up to see if we should be a little bit concerned or not. Looks like Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point, so I think that we will be moving forward with antibiotics, but of course we'll be talking to the physician who'll be having a look at you as well. So it sounds like you haven't been having too much symptoms aside from you've noticed this tick, the skin around it is fairly sore and you've had this in the past, but you were treated with antibiotics in the past and since then you haven't had too many health problems after that?\n\nP: No, no. I've been pretty healthy.\n\nD: OK, and just about your health right now, is there anything that you see the family physician or doctor for in general and regarding your health?\n\nP: Uh just for my cholesterol.\n\nD: OK, are you taking and medications for that?\n\nP: Uh Yeah, I take a uh statin, can't remember which one. \n\nD: OK, got it. And do you have any allergies?\n\nP: Uh no.\n\nD: So no drug allergies?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, now we've already talked about other exposures, so it doesn't sound like anyone else in your family or any pets are around, so it's unlikely that you have ticks coming in and you said you might have gotten this from gardening, but um you're hoping that your area doesn't have ticks. Maybe just take a look, ticks like to live in long grass, kind of on the intersection between woods and fields to see if there's any hovering around that kind of make a waving motion with their legs and they're sometimes easy to spot, you might wanna get some insecticide out there. But it sounds like this is fairly recent, unfortunately just for the length of time this tick might be on you for, it's probably safer than not to start you on some medications, but I'm going to go talk to the doctor after we do a quick physical exam, and we might also send the tick off to a local laboratory so they can identify the species for it definitively, as well as might just send some blood work just to see if there's any titres or any serology that would make us a little bit more concerned for Lyme disease. But aside from that you've been feeling well otherwise?\n\nP: Yeah, totally fine. It was just a little tender there and that's the only reason I looked.\n\nD: OK. So no headaches?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Nothing like that?\n\nP: Nothing like that. \n\nD: OK, excellent, alright. I'm fairly happy with what we talked about today. Do you have any questions for me Jean? \n\nP: No, this is pretty well what I expected today, so thanks for helping me out.\n\nD: No problem. OK, I'll go talk to the doctor, we'll come back and talk to you, OK? \n\nP: Great, thanks.\n\nD: Thanks Jean.",

just for the length of time this tick might be on you for its probably safer than not to start you on some medications but im going to go talk to the doctor after we do a quick physical exam and we might also send the tick off to [SUB:a->uh] local [SUB:laboratory->laboratories] so they can identify the species for it definitively as well as might just send some [INS:uh] blood work just to see if theres any [SUB:titres->titers] or any serology that would make us a little bit more concerned for [SUB:lyme->my] disease but aside from that youve been feeling well otherwise yeah totally fine it was just a little tender there and thats the only reason i looked [SUB:ok->okay] so no headaches no nothing like that [DEL:nothing] like that [SUB:ok->okay] excellent [INS:all] [SUB:alright->right] im fairly happy with what we talked about today do you have any questions for me jean no this is pretty well what i expected today so thanks for helping me out no problem [SUB:ok->okay] ill go talk to

And how would you describe the pain?\n\nP: It's intense, it's sharp.\n\nD: OK, and and has there been anything that you've tried that's made the pain better?\n\nP: Um no I haven't really tried anything. I've I can't seem to move it so every time I move it, it hurts. I'm trying to keep it pretty still and stationary. I took an ibuprofen, that's not, that doesn't seem to help.\n\nD: OK. And so like any movement makes it it worse, is there anything else that makes it worse, like putting socks on or even having I don't know clothing touch it or your shoes touch it?\n\nP: Yeah, I guess yeah, my shoes, my shoes touching it hurts.\n\nD: OK, and are you able to walk?\n\nP: I'm able to walk on it, it's just very painful and I can't you know, I can't bend that toe. I can't flex it or extend it, but my other toes are OK.\n\nD: Alright, and how would you describe the severity of this pain.

Actually sorry I have um high blood pressure as well as diabetes and I am a little overweight. But other than that, nothing else.\n\nD: OK, do you take medications for any of those things?\n\nP: Um I take ramipril for high blood pressure and I'm on insulin for the diabetes. \n\nD: OK, have you had any medication changes recently?\n\nP: Um no, no medication changes.\n\nD: OK. And have you had any prior hospitalizations or surgeries?\n\nP: I was recently hospitalised for kidney stones. But that since has resolved.\n\nD: OK.  Have you had any any surgeries?\n\nP: No surgeries, just the lithotripsy for the kidney stone.\n\nD: OK, and are your immunizations up to date?\n\nP: Yep they are. \n\nD: Excellent, um OK and do you smoke cigarettes? \n\nP: No, I don't.\n\nD: How about marijuana or using other cannabis products?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK and do you use any recreational drugs?\n\nP: Uh no.\n\nD: OK, and how about alcohol, how many drinks per week would you have usually?\n\nP: Um alcohol have about. I usually have about 2 glasses of wine a day.\n\nD: OK, and has that changed recently for you.\n\nP: No, not really. I've just been I've also been start drinking like a beer every day as well recently.\n\nD: OK. Alright, and alright could you tell me a little bit about your living situation right now who you're living with and and where?\n\nP: I live with my son in a house.\n\nD: OK, uh, and have you been around anybody who's been sick? \n\nP: No. \n\nD: Alright, and have you traveled anywhere recently?\n\nP: Um no no travel recently. \n\nD: OK, and and can you tell me a little bit about your diet an and like do you eat a lot of red meat and or a lot of seafood like like shell shellfish?\n\nP: I eat a lot of red meats. But not a lot of um seafood.\n\nD: OK. And. OK, and anybody in the family have a history of musculoskeletal or or neurological conditions?\n\nP: Um so. Who OK, so my my father had like arthritis and I don't remember what kind of arthritis he had but he had severe arthritis. He also had high blood pressure and diabetes, and on my mother's side. Um there is some arthritis there as well and as well as gout and kidney stones.\n\nD: OK.  So that that was everything I wanted to ask all the history. And so, uh, next to ask you to have a look at your feet. And are you seeing any swelling, redness, or discolouration?\n\nP: I see some redness and uh, some swelling in that area.\n\nD: OK, and are you feeling any temperature changes?\n\nP: Yes, and the right one is definitely warmer than the left.\n\nD: OK, then how about any muscle atrophy in the foot or or lower leg or any joint malalignment or deformities?\n\nP: Uh, so in terms of deformity is like it just looks swollen and so there's like a big bump on the right side of my foot, whereas it's completely straight on my left, but other than that, no deformities.\n\nD: OK, and if you were to a palpate or press on areas of your foot or joints of your toes, are you feeling any any pains along the top of your foot or or in any of your other toes?\n\nP: None of my other toes.\n\nD: OK, and how about any pains at the ankle?\n\nP: Um no pain at the ankle.\n\nD: OK, so the metatarsals are not having any pain and then the joints of the 2nd 5th digits are pain free along with the ankle as well. Um and when it comes to range of motion, are you able to flex your toes downwards and extend them upwards towards your nose?\n\nP: Yes, I can do that.\n\nD: OK, and how about your ankle, are you able to um move your ankle on a full range of motion.\n\nP: I can.\n\nD: OK, and are you having a limping with, walking or otherwise called an antalgic gait?\n\nP: Somewhat because I'm trying not to put too much weight on my right big toe.\n\nD: OK. Alright, and so I think that was everything that I wanted to ask and check today. So did you have any other questions or anything that I maybe forgot to ask about you wanted to mention today?\n\nP: Um no just what can I do for my foot how do I make the swelling go down?\n\nD: Yeah, for sure it's so right now with having a like a red, warm and swollen joint that that's extremely tender and has limited range of motion. It's important to rule out a septic arthritis, however. Based on several of the risk factors such as diabetes, and obesity, as well as your family history of arthritis and gout. Taking the most likely thing is that this is a gout flare, and in particular in the toe like that it could be called podagra and so we will need to get a aspiration of the joint fluid just to send it off and make sure that it's not not an infection and that we're treating the right thing. If this is, gout and it comes back that this way it's treated with that high dose, high doses of anti inflammatories. I will start with medication called colchicine to help with this flare, and in the meantime, important things for preventing this in the future are diet and kind of lifestyle related with reducing things like red meats, alcohol, weight loss and um just trying to improve the diabetes management as well.\n\nP: OK, that sounds great. Thank you.\n\nD: Alright, thank you, we will get that started.",

    "human_transcript": "D: What brings you here today?\n\nP: Um so I'm here because my shoulder has been really painful for the past week um and any movement of that shoulder, of my right shoulder, causes a lot of pain.\n\nD: OK, and how long have you been having uh this pain for?\n\nP: For the past week,\n\nD: Past week, OK. Um and did you injure your shoulder at all recently? Any trauma to the area or anything like that?\n\nP: Um so about like, a couple of months ago, I um was do, I I work in construction so um I was moving around some heavy objects and um I guess like the repetitive motions caused some sort of rotator cuff injury. But I had that um, like I got that treated and everything was fine for a couple of months. But this pain just started a week ago.\n\nD: OK, and where is this pain located exactly?\n\nP: Um it's it's just like in my shoulder, like at the joint between my upper arm and um shoulder.\n\nD: OK, and uh is it an aching pain or is it a sharp stabbing pain?\n\nP: So at rest it seems to be like achy and stiff, but um but when I move my shoulder, when I try to move it, it it causes more of a sharp pain.\n\nD: Sharp pain, OK and what kind of movements cause the sharp pain? Or is it just any movement?\n\nP: Uh any movement.\n\nD:  OK. Are there any uh movements that are worse in particular?\n\nP: Um I think um, like no, anything hurts.\n\nD: OK. OK, and how much would you rate this pain out, on a scale of zero to 10, 10 being the worst pain you felt in your life?\n\nP: I'd give it about a 7. \n\nD: Seven, OK.\n\nP: Yeah.\n\nD: And are you having uh, is this pain moving to any other uh joints or any other part of your body?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK, so just just in the area that you described?\n\nP: Yes. \n\nD: OK, and do you notice any kind of um, just looking at your shoulder outside, from the outside, any swelling, redness, any masses or deformities?\n\nP: No, I don't see anything like that.\n\nD: OK, alright and um is there anything that you've tried that has helped with your pain?\n\nP: Um I've tried some ibuprofen, some ice. It seems to help temporarily.\n\nD: OK, and earlier when you had the rotator cuff injury, did you get physiotherapy? \n\nP: Um I did. But not, but I didn't finish the full course. I just went for a week or so and then um I had to go back to work, um so I stopped doing that.\n\nD: I see, um yeah, so that's something definitely uh it's very important and we'll need to consider going forward as well. Other than that, are you having any symptoms of any fevers or chills?\n\nP: Uh no, nothing like that.\n\nD: OK, and have you been sick recently at all or met with someone who was sick?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, any any weight loss um or loss of appetite? Anything like that?\n\nP: Uh no, nothing like that.\n\nD: OK, any numbness or tingling? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: Any weakness in your extremities?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Any um any just symptoms or anything else like diarrhea, constipation, urinary changes? Anything else is going on?\n \nP: No. \n\nD: No, OK. So it's mainly just the shoulder pain?\n\nP: Yes. \n\nD: OK, um alright, and does rest help at all, like when you're lying down, just not moving your shoulder. Does that help with your pain?\n\nP: Uh, yeah I would say so.\n\nD: OK. And is is this stiffness there just throughout the day, or is it there in the morning and then gets better during the day?\n\nP: It's pretty much there all day.\n\nD: OK. Alright um and have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?\n\nP: Uh, I have um, I have diabetes, but that's about it.\n\nD: OK, and do you take any medications?\n\nP: I'm on metformin. \n\nD: OK. Um and do you have any allergies to any medications?\n\nP: No, no allergies to medications.\n\nD: Have you been hospitalized or had any surgeries in the past? \n\nP: No. \n\nD: No, OK. Um any family history of any musculoskeletal or rheumatological conditions?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK, and currently right now, so you said you work as a construction worker, right?\n\nP: Yes.\n\nD: And are you off of work right now, or have you been off work um due to your previous injury and pain, or are you still working?\n\nP: I'm still working, but modified, um so I am not uh lifting any heavy objects or anything like that. I'm just doing some like groundwork.\n\nD: OK, that's good. Yeah, I mean, um we might also need to, if you're doing any kind of overhead like work where you're raising your arms above your shoulders, that might uh, cause further problems as well, so we'll look into some of those modified duties as well.\n\nP: OK.\n\nD: Um yeah, and what is your living situation like right now? Who do you live with?\n\nP: Um I live by myself right now.\n\nD: Do you live in a house or apartment?\n\nP: Um I live in an apartment. \n\nD: And, uh, uh, in terms of your daily life, do you smoke at all?\n\nP: Um I don't smoke. I used to smoke before, but that was like 20 years ago.\n\nD: OK, that's good, and do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana or any other drugs?\n\nP: Uh no, no.\n\nD: How about smoking, you smoke cigarettes? Sorry, you said you you quit. Um do you drink alcohol?\n\nP: I'll drink like a glass of wine here and there.\n\nD: OK. Alright, um yeah, and those were some of the questions I had for you. In terms of just a physical examination, uh when you press on the area that you describe, um when you press around the area, does it hurt?\n\nP: I have to press pretty hard for it to hurt.\n\nD: OK, but otherwise it's not tender?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, and again, no swelling, redness, or anything like that, just it's mainly just on the inside?\n\nP: Yeah.\n\nD: OK, and um and any kind of movement hurts, right? There's no particular movement that, like if you were instead of um trying to raise that shoulder by itself, if you were to just move it with the other arm. Does it hurt?\n\nP: The other arm? The other arm doesn't hurt at all.\n\nD: Or like if you were to use your left arm to to passively move your right arm and shoulder. Does that hurt or is it when you just try to move the right arm by itself?\n\nP: It's, oh, it still hurts, any any moving of the shoulder hurts.\n\nD:  OK, alright, so yeah, so based on what um you've told me so far in your recent shoulder cuff injury, what can sometimes happen is uh with those injuries, you might get some um inflammation and what might happen is something called uh adhesive capsulitis, or just commonly knows as known as a frozen shoulder. And there's different stages, so that might happen, so in the initial stages like freezing um and then there's stiffening in stage two, and then usually after 6 to 12 months it starts uh getting better.\n\nP: OK.\n\nD: Um and it might also affect your other shoulder as well. So what we'll um end up doing today is see if um we can get some um imaging done so we can do an X-Ray of your shoulder. I'm sure you've had X Rays before, so we'll kind of compare them to your shoulder X Rays from before. We, if we need to, we can also get an ultrasound if um we don't, uh we can't really tell from the X Rays. And then from there, um we can get some blood work as well. Um just your normal blood work as well as inflammation markers, and then um from there we'll need to uh, really um discuss some management strategies. So you've already tried some physiotherapy, but now we need to make sure that's uh, it's it's consistent because this is something that has a high recurrence rate and we will definitely need to finish the full course of physiotherapy, whatever it may be, um because if physiotherapy doesn't work, we may have to consider like other options like um corticosteroid injections right into your shoulder.\n\nP: OK. \n\nD: For some relief.  But yeah, so first we'll just try some conservative methods like physiotherapy, pain management, uh and then go from there. How does that sound?\n\nP: That sounds pretty good. Thank you.\n\nD: Welcome, alright, so we'll call you for the X-Rays and then we'll go from there.\n\nP: OK, sounds good.",
    "asr_reconstructed": "what brings you here today um so im here because my shoulder has been really painful for the past week um and any movement of that shoulder of my right shoulder causes a lot of pain [SUB:ok->okay] and how long have you been [INS:uh] having uh this pain for for the past week past week [SUB:ok->okay] um and did you injure your shoulder at all recently any trauma to the area or anything like that um so about [INS:a] [INS:couple] like a couple [DEL:of] months ago i um was do i [INS:um] i work in construction so um i was moving around some heavy objects and um i guess like the repetitive motions caused some sort of rotator cuff injury but i had that um like i [INS:i] got that treated and everything was fine for a couple [DEL:of] months but this pain just started a week ago [INS:okay] [SUB:ok->okay] and where is this pain located exactly [DEL:um] its [DEL:its] just like in my shoulder like at the joint between my upper arm and [DEL:um] shoulder [SUB:ok->okay] and [DEL:uh] is it an aching pain or is it a sharp stabbing pain so at rest it seems to be like achy and stiff but [DEL:um] [DEL:but] when i move my shoulder [INS:or] when i try to move it it [DEL:it] causes more of a sharp pain sharp pain [SUB:ok->okay] and what kind of movements cause the sharp pain or is it just any movement uh any [INS:movements] [INS:any] movement [SUB:ok->okay] are there any uh movements that are worse in particular um i think um like no [INS:it] anything hurts [SUB:ok->okay] [SUB:ok->okay] and [INS:um] how much would you rate this pain out on a scale of zero to [SUB:10->ten] [SUB:10->ten] being the worst pain [SUB:you->youve] felt in your life [DEL:id] give it about a [SUB:7->seven] seven [SUB:ok->okay] yeah and [INS:uh] are you having uh is this pain moving to any other [DEL:uh] joints or any other part of your body no [SUB:ok->okay] so just [DEL:just] in the area that you described yes [SUB:ok->okay] and do you notice any kind of [DEL:um] just looking at your shoulder outside from the outside any swelling redness any masses or deformities no i dont see anything like that [INS:okay] [SUB:ok->all] [SUB:alright->right] and um is there anything that youve tried that has helped with your pain um ive tried some ibuprofen some ice it seems to help temporarily [SUB:ok->okay] and earlier when you had the rotator [SUB:cuff->cross] injury did you get physiotherapy um i did but not but i didnt finish the full course i just went for a week or so and then um i had to go back to work um so i stopped doing that i see um yeah so [INS:that] [INS:so] thats something definitely [SUB:uh->um] its very important and [INS:uh] well need to consider going forward as well [INS:um] other than that are you having any symptoms of any fevers or chills uh no nothing like that [SUB:ok->and] [SUB:and->uh] have you been [DEL:sick] recently at all or met with someone who was sick no [SUB:ok->okay] any [DEL:any] weight loss [DEL:um] or loss [SUB:of->in] appetite anything like that [DEL:uh] no nothing like that [SUB:ok->okay] any numbness or tingling no [INS:no] any weakness in your [SUB:extremities->extremity] no [INS:okay] any um any [INS:of] [SUB:just->the] symptoms [SUB:or->uh] anything else like diarrhea constipation urinary changes anything else [DEL:is] going on no no [SUB:ok->okay] so its mainly just the shoulder pain yes [SUB:ok->okay] um [INS:all] [SUB:alright->right] and does [INS:uh] rest help at all like when youre lying down just not moving your shoulder does that help with your pain uh yeah i would say so [SUB:ok->okay] and is is this stiffness there just throughout the day or is it there in the morning and then gets better during the day its pretty much there all day [INS:okay] [SUB:ok->all] [SUB:alright->right] um [DEL:and] have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past [DEL:uh] i have [DEL:um] [DEL:i] [DEL:have] diabetes but thats about it [SUB:ok->okay] and do you take any medications im on metformin [SUB:ok->okay] [DEL:um] and do you have any allergies to any medications no no allergies to medications [INS:okay] have you been hospitalized or had any surgeries in the past no no [SUB:ok->okay] [DEL:um] any family history of any musculoskeletal or [SUB:rheumatological->rheumatologic] conditions no [INS:no] [SUB:ok->okay] and currently right now so you said you work as a construction worker right yes and are you off of work right now or have you been off [INS:of] work [DEL:um] due to your previous injury and pain or are you still working im still working but modified um so i am not [DEL:uh] lifting any heavy objects or anything like that im just doing some like [INS:ground] [SUB:groundwork->work] [SUB:ok->okay] thats good yeah [SUB:i->and] [DEL:mean] um [SUB:we->you] might also need to if youre doing any kind of overhead like work where youre raising your arms above your shoulders that might [DEL:uh] cause further problems as well so well look into some of those modified duties as well [SUB:ok->okay] [DEL:um] yeah and [INS:uh] what is your living situation like right now who do you live with um i live by myself right now [INS:and] do you live in a house or apartment um i live in an apartment [INS:okay] and [SUB:uh->um] uh in terms of your daily life [INS:uh] do you smoke at all um i dont smoke i used to smoke before but that was like 20 years ago [SUB:ok->okay] thats good [INS:um] and do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana or any other drugs [DEL:uh] no no how about smoking [INS:do] you smoke cigarettes sorry you said you [DEL:you] quit [DEL:um] do you drink alcohol ill drink like a glass of wine here and there [SUB:ok->okay] [DEL:alright] [DEL:um] [DEL:yeah] [DEL:and] [DEL:those] [DEL:were] [DEL:some] [DEL:of] [DEL:the] [DEL:questions] [DEL:i] [DEL:had] [DEL:for] [DEL:you] [DEL:in] [DEL:terms] [DEL:of] [DEL:just] [DEL:a] [DEL:physical] [DEL:examination] [DEL:uh] [DEL:when] [DEL:you] [DEL:press] on the area that you describe um when you press around the area does it hurt i have to press pretty hard for it to hurt [SUB:ok->okay] but otherwise [INS:uh] its not tender no [SUB:ok->okay] and again no swelling redness or anything like that [DEL:just] its mainly just on the inside yeah [SUB:ok->okay] and um and any kind of movement hurts right theres no particular movement [SUB:that->thats] like if you were instead of um trying to raise that shoulder by itself if you were to just move it with the other arm does it hurt the other arm the other arm doesnt hurt at all or [DEL:like] if you were to use your left arm to [DEL:to] passively move your right arm and shoulder does that hurt or is it when you just try to move the right arm by itself its oh it still hurts any [DEL:any] moving of the shoulder hurts [SUB:ok->okay] [SUB:alright->all] [SUB:so->right] [DEL:yeah] so [DEL:based] on what um youve [INS:uh] told me so far [SUB:in->and] your recent [INS:uh] shoulder cuff injury what can sometimes happen is uh with those injuries you might get some um inflammation and what might happen is something called [DEL:uh] adhesive capsulitis or just commonly knows as known as a frozen shoulder and theres different stages so that might happen so [DEL:in] the initial [INS:stage] [SUB:stages->is] like freezing um and then theres stiffening in stage two and then usually after [INS:like] [SUB:6->six] to 12 months it starts uh getting better [SUB:ok->okay] um and it might also affect your other shoulder as well so what well um end up doing today is see if [INS:we] [INS:can] [INS:get] [INS:some] [INS:imaging] [INS:end] [INS:up] [INS:doing] [INS:today] [INS:is] [INS:see] [INS:if] um we can get some um imaging done so we can do [INS:uh] an xray of your shoulder im sure youve had [SUB:x->uh] [SUB:rays->xrays] before so well kind of compare them to your shoulder [SUB:x->xrays] [DEL:rays] from before we if we need to we can also get [INS:um] an ultrasound if um we dont [DEL:uh] we cant really tell from the [SUB:x->xrays] [DEL:rays] and then from there um we can get some blood work as well [DEL:um] just your normal blood work as well as [INS:with] inflammation [DEL:markers] and then [DEL:um] from there well need to [DEL:uh] really [DEL:um] discuss some management strategies so youve already tried some physiotherapy but [DEL:now] we need to make sure [SUB:thats->that]

    "human_transcript": "D: Uh, how can I help you?\n\nP: Uh, I have just been feeling very short of breath recently.\n\nD: OK.\n\nP: And I thought I should come in. I've also had a, I've also had a cough.\n\nD: I see. OK, uhm, and when does this shortness of breath, uhm, come on? How, how much activity are you able to do?\n\nP: Uhm, I can walk a block.\n\nD: OK.\n\nP: Without being short of breath.\n\nD: And prior to this change, how far were you able to walk and and how long ago did you, did you notice this change?\n\nP: Uhm, I, I guess I could walk, uh, I don't know, it's been very, I guess it's, it's been a gradual change. Uhm, maybe a month, a month ago I felt that I couldn't really walk as much as I used to, and then it's only gotten worse. Two or three months ago I could, I could walk a kilometre or two, or more.\n\nD: OK, so quite a significant change over the last little while. Have you had any episodes where you wake up in the middle of the night with, with shortness of breath, and you need to sit up? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, and how many pillows do you sleep with?\n\nP: One.\n\nD: OK and have you noticed any like ankle swelling or or leg swelling?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK. And you mentioned cough. When did that start?\n\nP: I've had a cough for a while, the past five, ten years, but I feel that it's been a little bit more frequent now. It's just, I just get into this coughing fit and I think there was a time when I had a little bit of blood come out as well, once or twice. The coughing also makes it difficult for me to breathe, you know, I feel very short of breath after that.\n\nD: Yeah, certainly, uhm, how much blood have you coughed up?\n\nP: Oh, I don't know. I think it was it was a little bit.\n\nD: Did it happen each time, or has it only been a couple of times?\n\nP: I think maybe, two or three times but then there have also been times when I cough up this, this stuff that I cough up is a little bit pink in color. It's not exactly blood, but it's, it's, you know, pinkish.\n\nD: OK, and are you producing sputum each time you're coughing up?\n\nP: Most of the times, yes.\n\nD: OK, is this a change from previously? Did you have a dry cough before?\n\nP: A bit more of a dry cough before, but I mean, so sometimes it will be a dry cough sometimes, uh, it was more of a wet cough, but it was, it was usually just this white thing coming up. It wasn't like, there was never blood before.\n\nD: OK, and you're coughing more often as well over this last month?\n\nP: Oh yeah, Oh yeah, \n\nD: OK. Have you been experiencing any, any headaches?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK, how about any eye pain or ear pain?\n\nP: No, no, no.\n\nD: How about any eye redness or, or discharge?\n\nP: Nope. \n\nD: Any runny nose or sore throat?\n\nP: no. \n\nD: OK, have you had any fevers or chills?\n\nP: Uhm, I, I checked my fevers, I checked my temperature uh, couple days ago. It's just been this little bit, 30, I think it was 38. \n\nD: OK, so, yeah, that would be a fever.\n\nP: That was I think two weeks ago.\n\nD: OK, do you feel hot now?\n\nP: Not really, no. \n\nD: OK. Have you had any night sweats?\n\nP: Uh, no.\n\nD: And have you had any weight loss over the last several months?\n\nP: Oh, yeah.\n\nD: How much weight?\n\nP: About 20 pounds.\n\nD: OK, and so how, How long was that weight loss over?\n\nP: I'd say about about, uh, three, three-four months?\n\nD: OK and sorry, what was your starting weight, roughly?\n\nP: Yeah, yeah I was, uhm, 210 pounds.\n\nD: OK, uhm, so yeah, about a 10% reduction in your weight over the last couple of months, it sounds like. OK, How is your appetite been?\n\nP: Uh, it's OK. \n\nD: Alright, and have you been having any chest pain?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: Any, any wheeze? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: Have you had any dizziness or lightheadedness? \n\nP: Uhm no, no.\n\nD: OK, how about any nausea or vomiting?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Any diarrhea or constipation?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Any urinary problems?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Any skin rashes or muscle aches. \n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, and, uh, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?\n\nP: Yeah, I've been diagnosed with COPD, with, uh, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.\n\nD: I see, alright and do you take any medications for those? \n\nP: Uh, I take Lipitor.\n\nD: OK.\n\nP And I take some puffers but don't use them very frequently. I forget to use them. And they, I tried them, but they haven't been very helpful these past two months.\n\nD: OK, so yeah, you've tried them, when you were short of breath and they haven't helped?\n\nP: They haven't done much. \n\nD: OK. And are you allergic to any medications or have any allergies?\n\nP: Uhm, no.\n\nD: Alright, and have you been hospitalized for any reason, or like, including COPD exacerbation?\n\nP: Oh yeah, yeah.\n\nD: Or any similar symptoms?\n\nP: It's been, uh, I was, uh, I was actually hospitalized about four or five times last year.\n\nD: And was this for COPD exacerbations?\n\nP: Yeah, yeah. \n\nD: OK, did those each require a stay in the hospital?\n\nP: Two or three of them I did, yeah. \n\nD: OK. And have you had any surgeries? \n\nP: Uh, no.\n\nD: And are you currently smoking? \n\nP: Yeah.\n\nD: OK, how much do you smoke per day?\n\nP: I've got it down quite a bit. I only have two cigarettes a day. I used to have a pack and a half, Uh, but I've got it down a lot. I'm trying to, I'm trying to quit, but it's hard.\n\nD: Yeah, for sure it's great that you're working towards quitting. We can discuss that further and there are several options that might be available to help if it's something you're interested in, because yeah, it's definitely really hard. Are you, do you drink alcohol?\n\nP: Uh, once in a while, on Christmas.\n\nD: OK, and do you use any recreational drugs?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: You smoke marijuana or use marijuana products?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Alright, and who are you living with currently?\n\nP: I live with my wife.\n\nD: OK, and are you, uhm, do you help looking after the home, and uh, like functionally independent right now?\n\nP: Uh, yeah. I use a cane. \n\nD: Mhm, ok.\n\nP: And uh, yeah, my, my son comes over and helps out with groceries and my wife cooks but, I, I help her with cleaning sometimes.\n\nD: OK, great and, so are you retired?\n\nP: yep.\n\nD: OK, uhm, and has anybody in the family had any heart or lung conditions?\n\nP: My dad died of lung cancer. He was a, he was a big smoker as well. And my mom had a heart attack. \n\nD: OK, and how old were your parents approximately?\n\nP: Yeah, my dad was 65 and my mom was, was very young, she was 50.\n\nD: I see. Did your mom survive the heart attack?\n\nP: No, no she did not.\n\nD: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Uhm, and the lung cancer you mention, any other cancers that run in the family?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK, so that was all the questions I wanted to ask on on history. Uhm certainly it sounds like you're bringing up some blood with, with, with the increased cough and with difficulties breathing so we will get a, uhm, a chest x-ray and possibly a CT image of your chest as well to see if there's anything going on in your lungs and we might do some blood work as well to check a few things so uhm, we'll get those ordered and, and see what, see what that shows.\n\nP: Thank you.",

Yeah.\n\nD: OK. Any family history of any lung or heart conditions? Any cancers?\n\nP: Uhm, yeah, my dad had had a heart attack actually, but he was in his 80s when that, when that happened.\n\nD: OK, uhm and currently right now, are you working at all?\n\nP: No, I'm retired. I used to be a teacher for Grade 3, uhm, but yeah, but since retired and my husband and I just moved into a smaller apartment to make it a bit easier on us. It was a lot trying to look after the house.\n\nD: OK, well congratulations on your new home. Are you at all, you or your husband requiring any kind of supports outside of the home at all?\n\nP: No, between us two we managed to get the shopping done, the cooking and and all the cleaning, and that sort of thing.

However, yeah so after that since you're having some symptoms of what might be a pneumonia, it can be a bacterial infection, a viral infection, we will have to get some blood work done as well as a chest x-ray. And right now, with the pandemic going on, we will also do Covid swab test for you as well, just in case. Does that sound good?\n\nP: Yeah, that makes sense, thank you.\n\nD: Alright and, if if you're while you're here, if your shortness of breath gets any worse at all, just let us know and we'll help you out.\n\nP: OK, thank you, will do.\n\nD: Thank you, bye.\n\nP: Bye.",

    "human_transcript": "D: What brings you in?\n\nP: I brought my son in today because he had a fever that started two days ago and, and then since then he he's had a cough that started as well and it it he's been short of breath. It looks like he's like breathing faster and just having a harder time to breathe.\n\nD: OK, uhm, before the fever, did you notice any other symptoms, like a runny nose or a stuffy nose?\n\nP: No, nothing like that. Yeah, the fever kind of came on pretty, pretty suddenly it seemed like.\n\nD: OK, and did you take his temperature at home? \n\nP: I did, yeah. It was like 38.7 and then like two days ago and then it was high again, like yesterday and today.\n\nD: OK, and you mentioned the coughing started soon after the fever, correct?\n\nP: Yeah, yeah kind of like the day after e started having getting this cough.\n\nD: OK and is it a dry cough or is it a productive cough? \n\nP: It's, uh, yeah, he is bringing up a little bit of sputum, yeah he's doing it.\n\nD: OK, what color is the sputum?\n\nP: Uh, it's a maybe like like greenish, greenish, yellow?\n\nD: Greenish yellow, OK. Any blood in there?\n\nP: No, I haven't noticed any any blood.\n\nD: OK, and does he seem short of breath or wheezy? \n\nP: No wheezing, but he does have some shortness of breath.\n\nD: OK. And the service of bread started with a cough?\n\nP: Ii did, yeah.\n\nD: OK. Uhm, how much shortness of breath is he having? Is it just when he's exerting himself or is it at rest as well?\n\nP: I'd say ah, even at rest now he's like breathing faster.\n\nD: OK, umm, and it does anything help with that? So does sitting up help? Or, uh, you know, getting fresh air or anything like that?\n\nP: No. But you'd say, like taking a smaller breaths helps because like if he if he takes a deep breath and he gets, he gets like chest pain. \n\nD: OK, OK, and how about when he's laying down?\n\nP: No, he hasn't said anything like, like that for laying down just I think when he's just taking a deep breath, he said.\n\nD: OK, is it waking him up from sleep?\n\nP: Uh, no.\n\nD: No, OK. How about chest pain?\n\nP: Yeah, so yeah he's had some pain when he, when he just really takes that deep breath in.\n\nD: OK. Does he ever feel like his heart's racing?\n\nP: Uhm, no. \n\nD: No, OK. Uhm how about any dizziness or fainting spells?\n\nP: No, he doesn't have anything like that.\n\nD: OK, has he had a sore throat?\n\nP: No, no.\n\nD: Any changes in vision or hearing?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Uh, smell or taste?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: No. Weight loss?\n\nP: No, he's been gaining weight well.\n\nD: OK, how about any rashes?\n\nP: Nope, I haven't noticed any.\n\nD: OK, uhm, and then any numbness or tingling?\n\nP: No, he hasn't said anything like that.\n\nD: OK, muscle aches or joint aches?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK. Confusion or memory loss?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Changes in his bowel movements?\n\nP: Nope, yeah, that's been been getting out, no diarrhea or anything like that. \n\nD: OK. Changes in his voiding?\n\nP: Nope, he hasn't had any urinary problems.\n\nD: OK. And is he an otherwise healthy child? Umm, does he have any longstanding medical conditions?\n\nP: No, he doesn't. That's uh, this was so surprising, he's been healthy.\n\nD: OK. Has he, so he's never had any hospitalizations or surgeries? \n\nP: No, he hasn't.\n\nD: OK. How about his mother's pregnancy with him? Were there any complications at that point?\n\nP: Nope, everything went went well. No complications and he was like a good birth weight and went home right away. \n\nD: OK. OK, and how about the delivery itself? Any complications during that, that point?\n\nP: Oh no, not it was a vaginal delivery and it was normal.\n\nD: OK. And he didn't need to be hospitalized as a newborn for anything like jaundice or shortness of breath?\n\nP: Uh, nope, he hasn't had any any reason to be hospitalized.\n\nD: OK. Uhm alright. And has he been hitting all his developmental milestones as well as like his height, weight and head circumference milestones?\n\nP: He has, yeah, he's been growing well and reaching the developments stones, milestones.\n\nD: OK, is he on any medications?\n\nP: Uh, no he's not on any medications.\n\nD: OK. Any allergies?\n\nP: No allergies.\n\nD: Uhm, is he up to date with all his immunizations?\n\nP: He is, yeah. \n\nD: OK. Any family history of lung or heart conditions.\n\nP: Uh, no, nothing like that.\n\nD: OK. Have about cancers in the family?\n\nP: No, no cancers luckily.\n\nD: Can you think of anyone he's been in contact with who's also been sick?\n\nP: Yeah, maybe, he has a younger sister that goes to daycare and she was sick last week with like she had a cough and stuff as well.\n\nD: OK. OK, and does she have a fever as well?\n\nP: She did, yeah, she got better. Right uh, last week we we had to take her to to see the doctor and she got antibiotics for that. Actually for, for a few days. \n\nD: OK, OK. And have you traveled anywhere recently?\n\nP: No, we've been at home.\n\nD: OK. Does anyone at home smoke?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: No, OK. And who lives at home with him?\n\nP: So it's me, his mom, and then his younger sister.\n\nD: OK. Any old carpets, mold, dust, asbestos, anything that could exacerbate his condition?\n\nP: No, I don't think so. It's a newer home. \n\nD: OK, good. Umm, so those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own?\n\nP: Uhm, no, I, no that was everything I think. The only I I guess other thing that that I forgot to mention is that just he doesn't really like his appetite's been a little bit lower couple of days as well. But uh, he hasn't had any, like nausea or vomiting though.\n\nD: OK, OK, yeah, that's good to know. Uhm, so because some of his symptoms overlap with those of Covid, we will do a swab on him and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results and he should isolate for 14 days because of those symptoms. And it doesn't, it sounds more in keeping with the picture of community acquired pneumonia, so for that we will get a chest x-ray, we'll check his oxygen and his temperature and if the chest x-ray shows consolidation umm, or some sort of infiltrate, it is likely that he has pneumonia. So, we will start by giving him some amoxicillin populate or cefuroxime for five days, and just keep monitoring his symptoms. They should resolve in about 5 days when the course of antibiotics is complete. If his condition gets worse like he's getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, just take him to the ER. And if symptoms don't resolve in five to seven days, we can do further work up or things like fungal infections or TB, or things like that. How does that sound?\n\nP: That sounds great. Thank you.\n\nD: OK, yeah, no problem.",

Um, is it like a sharp, stabbing pain, or is it an aching pain?\n\nP: It's a, a stabbing pain.\n\nD: Okay, and uh, are you mainly having the pain with movement of your knee, or um, when you're pressing on it?\n\nP: Uh, I would say both, I can't um, I can't really move it, it'll give me pain. And even pressing on it, it's, it's quite painful.\n\nD: Okay. And on a scale of uh, 1 to 10, sorry 0 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you've felt in your life, how much would you rate this pain?\n\nP: Uh, it's a 9.\n\nD: A 9, okay. Um, so it just started a few hours ago. Is there anything that makes the pain better or worse?\n\nP: Um, I mean just trying to stay as still as possible is all I've been been doing so far, uh because, um, like any type of movement is really bad.\n\nD: Okay, and are you able to weight bear, are you able to stand and walk by yourself?\n\nP: Uh, I, I was pretty much like hopping on one leg to, to get in here and as soon as I could, I got in a wheelchair, just because it uh, hurts so bad. \n\nD: Okay, and um, do you have any pain or symptoms in any other joints or muscles of your body?\n\nP: No, just, it's just my left knee.\n\nD: Just your left knee, okay.

I've been just, in well, in the city. I haven't traveled anywhere, and I uh, I haven't been sexually active for, for quite a while now, so. \n\nD: Okay, okay. Uh, have you recently, at all, had um, any procedures done on your knee, like any surgeries or any joint like um, injections or aspirations?\n\nP: No, nothing done to my knee.\n\nD: Okay. Okay, um, so yeah, we'll take a temperature of your uh, fever, and, so are you able to flex or extend your knee at all, or is it very painful?\n\nP: It's really painful. I uh, the movement's really limited.\n\nD: Okay, and has the pain been constant since it started a few hours ago.\n\nP: Yeah, it's gotten uh, like it's, it's gotten slightly worse.\n\nD: Okay, I see. Okay, um, any skin changes or rashes anywhere on your body?\n\nP: No, it's just the red knee.\n\nD: Okay. Um, any changes in your weight or appetite?\n\nP: Uh no, no.

Any diabetes? High blood pressure?\n\nP: Uh, I've been told my, my blood sugar has been like, it hasn't been controlled, so yeah, I think I have diabetes. Um, uh, but that's, that's it.\n\nD: Okay, um, do you take anything for medicate, medication for your diabetes?\n\nP: Uh, yeah, I, I take metformin and um, and uh, yeah, that, that's all I've been taking, but, I mean, it's really hard for me to uh, like get my medication sometimes and so um, I don't always take it. \n\nD: Okay, I see. Um, and do you have any allergies to any medications? \n\nP: Uh, not that I, not that I can think of. And, so something that I forgot to mention is uh, like I've had hepatitis in the past as well um, and uh, yeah. \n\nD: And do you know hepatitis you've had? \n\nP: Um, I've had, it was uh, hepatitis C and uh, I was, um, treated, I was treated for it. \n\nD: Okay. Okay, and how long ago was that?\n\nP: That was about uh, two years ago.\n\nD: Okay, and uh, did they tell you like how it may have been transmitted at all? Was it, uh, sexually? Um, was it through um, use of IV drug use? And did they tell you what the likely cause was?\n\nP; Yeah, the, the likely cause was um, I was told it was through IV uh, drug use. I've been using now for uh, for about 10 years.\n\nD: Okay, and have you um, and what do you usually use? \n\nP: Uh, well like, any, anything that I, that I can usually. But I, I guess like um, various types of opioids are kind of the, the, the main thing that I'll, that I'll use.\n\nD: Okay, and have you um, injected uh, drugs recently at all?\n\nP: Uh, yeah I, about uh, about two days ago was the last time.\n\nD: Okay, okay. And um, do you use any other uh, drugs? Any recreational drugs like marijuana or any, do you inject any other drugs at all?\n\nP: Yeah, I'll smoke, uh, smoke marijuana as well and um, like, I'll sometimes like, I'll take uh, pills too like dilaudid is um, is something that I'll, I'll get my hands on, but it can be expensive so, um, just, just whatever is available.\n\nD: Okay. Um, have you had uh, when was the last time you had cellulitis?\n\nP: Uh, he last time was about six months ago.\n\nD: Okay, and were you admitted at all, or were you treated as an outpatient?\n\nP: Uh, I was treated as an outpatient for that, and it did clear up. It wasn't the first time that I've, I've had cellulitis and, and um, yeah, so it was treated.\n\nD: Okay, have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?\n\nP: Um no, I haven't.\n\nD: Okay. Uh, any family history of any conditions um, musculoskeletal or rheumatologic conditions? Uh, any rheumatoid arthritis, anything like that? \n\nP: Uh, I don't think so.\n\nD: Okay. And currently, right now, um, what is your living situation like?\n\nP: Uh, so um, I just live with uh, two of my, um, or actually sorry no, I live with my uh, with my parents and uh, yeah, so it's just both my parents.\n\nD: Okay. And, um, do you currently work?\n\nP: Uh, I was working until like, I um, yeah about uh, about 15 years ago and now I, like I got injured on the, uh, um at work and I've had like chronic back pain and I don't know, I think that's kind of how this partly all, all started. So I've been at home receiving uh, I'm on disability.\n\nD: Okay. And do you smoke cigarettes?\n\nP: Uh, I do, yeah I, I, I smoke um, about half a pack uh, to a pack a day.\n\nD: Okay, and how long have you been smoking for?\n\nP: Uh, so this has been, uh, about 20 years.\n\nD: 20 years, okay. And do you drink alcohol? \n\nP: Um, sometimes yeah. I'll, I'll have uh, just a few beers, maybe a few beers a week. \n\nD: Okay, and yeah, we were just talking about some of uh, like the movement, but you're saying you have pain with any kind of movement at all, right?\n\nP: Yeah, it, it's really painful, I just, I try not to move it at all. \n\nD: And it's very red and swollen and warm as well?\n\nP: Yeah, all of those. \n\nD: Any symptoms at all in your hips or ankle?\n\nP: No, those feel fine. I can move my hip and ankle okay, and no pain.\n\nD: Okay, alright, so those are all the questions I had for you. We'll do like a full physical examination, take a look at your knee, um, and most likely, what this sounds like, is something called septic arthritis. It's uh, it's when there's like an infection that um, can go into your joints and uh, it is a pretty serious issue that we need to um, assess and treat as soon as possible. So the first thing that we will um, need to do, we'll need to do some blood work just to get some inflammation markers and just your uh, CBC, and see if you have um, an infection. However, we'll also need to do a joint aspiration of your of your um, go your knee, and we'll be taking some fluid within your joint called the synovial fluid and assess for um, we'll send in for um, culture, and look for like these crystals, and count. And then based on that, we'll understand um, the infection you have and what kind of infection you have. We will start you on antibiotics right away um, today, and so you will be um, here for a while until we get all those results back. And you may also require um, an admission today as well.\n\nP: Okay, uh, thank you. Yeah, that, that sounds good.\n\nD: Alright, yeah, so yeah, we'll get all that done for you shortly, and uh, we'll go from there. \n\nP: Right, thank you.\n\nD: And um, we might also need an x-ray, so just sit tight. We'll, we'll come call you.\n\nP: Okay, thank you.\n\nD: Alright, you're welcome.",

    "human_transcript": "D: What brings you here today?\n\nP: Um I'm here because my left hand, kind of just like at the base of my thumb, has been hurting for the past two days and it seems to be getting worse, um and I'm left handed so it's really hard for me to write or do anything um where I have to like, clench or grip things.\n\nD: OK, and how long has this been going on for?\n\nP: Uhm, so for the past two days, but it's got, it got bad yesterday.\n\nD: OK, and have you had any, uh if you were to describe the pain, where is it located exactly?\n\nP: It's just at the base of my thumb. Uh you know where the fleshy part of your hand is?\n\nD: OK yeah yeah.\n\nP: Yeah, so just just over there.\n\nD: OK, and what kind of pain is it? Is it sharp or is it aching?\n\nP: Uhm, it's it's like a um, at baseline it's an achy pain, but if I try to move it or um try to write or you know, use a computer or anything like that, it becomes sharp. \n\nD: OK, Um and on a scale of uh zero to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've felt in your life, how much would you rate it?\n\nP: I'd say like a 6.\n\nD: OK, and does this pain move anywhere else in your hand, or does it just stay where you described?\n\nP: Um it just stays there. \n\nD: OK, and what kind of motions uh cause the most pain?\n\nP: I'd say like um you know, trying to touch my pinky with my thumb, that that hurts. Um just like trying to rotate it hurts.\n\nD: OK, um have you tried anything for the pain that has helped? \n\nP: Uhm, no, I haven't really tried too much. I've just I just tried not to use it as much.\n\nD: I see. OK. And um, has this ever like, have you ever had any injuries to this hand? Any trauma either recently or in the past?\n\nP: No, no, nothing like that.\n\nD: OK. Alright, and is there any, do you do any kind of repetitive work that requires gripping or lifting um with that hand, anything repetitive?\n\nP: So I do a lot of work at the computer. And um I guess I tend to type a lot with my left hand, so maybe that.\n\nD: OK.\n\nP: And sorry I also take lots of notes, like handwritten notes with my left hand.\n\nD: OK, so are you left handed? \n\nP: Yes.\n\nD: OK. Alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: No, so you're healthy?\n\nP: Yes.\n\nD: Um do you take any medications on a regular basis? \n\nP: Uh no, no.\n\nD: No, OK. Any allergies to any medications?\n\nP: Um no allergies.\n\nD: OK, um any previous surgeries or hospitalizations?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: No, any family history of any medical conditions, whether it's musculoskeletal, rheumatological, any conditions?\n\nP: Uh no, nothing like that.\n\nD: OK, um any cancers in the family?\n\nP: Um I know there's, yeah there's a lot of cancer in the family. There's colon cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer. \n\nD: OK. And are they first degree relatives who had those cancers?\n\nP: Uh no first degree relatives, just like aunts and uncles. \n\nD: OK. Uh alright, and currently are you working right now or have you had any time off work or any modified duties?\n\nP: Um so I'm still working online, I've just um haven't been taking notes by hand anymore.\n\nD: I see, and does that help though? \n\nP: Uh yeah it it has helped a little bit because I'm not moving my hand as much so it helps with the pain. \n\nD: OK. Have you taken any uh Tylenol, Advil, anything for the pain? \n\nP: No, I haven't.\n\nD: OK. Alright. And currently right now, what is your living situation like?\n\nP: Uh I live in an apartment by myself.\n\nD: OK, and um, do you currently uh smoke cigarettes? \n\nP: Um I smoke, I used to smoke like five years ago, and I only did that for like a year or two, um and it wasn't very much. But I don't smoke anymore.\n\nD: OK, that's good. Um any alcohol?\n\nP: Um I'll have like a beer on the weekend.\n\nD: OK. Any recreational drugs like marijuana?\n\nP: Um I will take an edible like once a month.\n\nD: OK. Um and yeah, those were just some of the questions I had um and we're just going to do a few things for examining, examining uh that area. So are you able to make a fist?\n\nP: Um I can, but it hurts.\n\nD: OK, it hurts in that location that you mentioned?\n\nP: Yes. \n\nD: How about um if you make a fist without your thumb, does it still hurt or is it just when you are moving the thumb?\n\nP: It's just when I'm moving the thumb.\n\nD: OK. And if you were able to, are you able to uh rotate your wrist?\n\nP: Uh yes, I can rotate my wrist.\n\nD: Does that hurt at all? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, um now I just want you to do this one test. It's called a Finkelstein test. OK so I want you to flex your thumb, press it up down against your palm.\n\nP: OK. \n\nD: And then hold your hand, sorry.\n\nP: No, go ahead.\n\nD: Yeah, and then after you do that, um, bring your fingers above your thumb, so just cover your thumb.\n\nP: OK.\n\nD: Kind of like a fist, but your thumb is on the inside of your fingers.\n\nP: OK.\n\nD: And then bring your uh arm out.\n\nP: OK. \n\nD: And with your other hand, can you, from above push your wrist downwards? So your uh pinky finger is uh pointing to the pointing to the ground.\n\nP: OK, yep.\n\nD: Yeah, and did that hurt at all? Like when you, so this is just called ulnar deviation or your um of your wrist. Does that hurt at all?\n\nP: Yes, that is very painful.\n\nD: That's very painful, OK. Alright, um and then you're also having pain with gripping and, OK, so those are kind of all the things I wanted to ask. Uh it seems that you may be having something called De Quervain's tenosynovitis. Um it's caused by some repetitive motions, uh it can be due to gripping. Sometimes it happens to new mothers who are lifting their children as well as daycare workers. It can also happen in other work environments, and so what we will first just need to do um is mainly to rule out something like osteoarthritis. You are fairly young um but if there was ever an injury in the past, it you can have early osteoarthritis in the area. So we just want to get an X-Ray. And other than that, the way we kind of deal with this issue is usually conservatively and with a splint. \n\nP: OK. \n\nD: And a sling for your thumb that uh helps relieve some of these symptoms, uh restricts some of your movements, reduces some of the swelling, and if it does get really bad and it's affecting your work and conservative management with pain and the splint don't work, and with physiotherapy, we do uh offer injecting corticosteroids into just right like in the area that you mentioned, right below the thumb.\n\nP: OK. \n\nD: Um and that often has some effect as well. Um but at first, yeah, let's just do some conservative management and see if that helps. It's only been a few days, so hopefully um what we try first helps. And then we can go on from there.\n\nP: OK yeah, that sounds great. Thank you. \n\nD: Welcome, take care.\n\nP: You too.",

    "human_transcript": "D: Would you mind by starting with what brought you in?\n\nP: Yeah, so over the last week I've just been feeling some symptoms. It kind of first started with, like a runny nose. That was around like 5 days ago and then it turned into just a lot of congestion, like around my nose and like my throat. And now over the last two days I've been just feeling so much pressure around my nose and around my jaw so I've been getting a lot of pain there as well.\n\nD: OK, is your nose still running?\n\nP: Yeah, I'm still getting some discharge and I also feel like I'm getting some dripping at the back of my throat too, especially when I wake up.\n\nD: OK, and could you describe the discharge? Is it clear, yellow, greenish?\n\nP: Uh, it's fairly clear and sometimes, like a bit white, but like, it's not like green or yellow.\n\nD: OK, uh, and have you felt that it's difficult to breathe in through either of your nostrils, like it's obstructed?\n\nP: Yeah, so at night sometimes I have to like turn because one side of my nose gets difficult to breathe from and then it kind of balances out on the other side. So yeah, I do have some obstruction.\n\nD: OK, and have you had any changes to your sense of smell?\n\nP: Yeah, so just in the last three days when the congestion got really bad I started losing the ability to smell.\n\nD: OK, have you had any changes to your sense of taste?\n\nP: No, taste is fine. \n\nD: OK, and have you had any cough or sore throat?\n\nP: Uh, no. No cough or sore throat.\n\nD: OK, and the symptoms have gone on for five days. Have you had a period of time where you got better and then got sick again? \n\nP: I did kind of have a runny nose last week as well, so probably like 8 days ago but then the runny nose discontinued a little bit but really got worse 5 days ago, but all these other symptoms just happened in the last few days.\n\nD: OK, and you have pain. Do you feel it in your jaw or do you feel it in the in the front of your nose?\n\nP: Yes, I would say mainly over the cheeks. It can kind of go near the front of my teeth as well, so like I would say like mostly around the cheeks, jaws and up to the front of my teeth. \n\nD: OK, And do you grind your teeth at all at night? or have you had, TMJ issues before?\n\nP: No nothing like that. I think it's not so much on and around my teeth, it's more so just to right below my nose, above my teeth and just around my cheeks.\n\nD: OK, so no pain in your mouth or anything like that?\n\nP: No, not inside my mouth.\n\nD: OK, have you had any fevers or chills?\n\nP: Uhm, I Don't think I've had a fever. I did feel some chills over the last few days, but just very brief episodes.\n\nD: OK, and over the last few weeks have you had any weight loss? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, and you said you didn't have a cough or a sore throat, but have you had any wheezing?\n\nP: No wheezing.\n\nD: How about any shortness of breath?\n\nP: Uh, not shortness of breath. Just sometimes when my nose gets like really congested, I just turn into like a mouth breather, but that's about it.\n\nD: I see, OK, and have you had any chest pain?\n\nP: No, no chest pain. \n\nD: Alright, and any lightheadedness or feeling dizzy?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, have you had any nausea or vomiting?\n\nP: Nope. \n\nD: Any abdominal pain? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: Have you had any diarrhea?\n\nP: Sorry, what was that?\n\nD: Have you had any diarrhea?\n\nP: No diarrhea. \n\nD: OK, and have you had any urinary problems?\n\nP: Uh, no.\n\nD: And have you had any rashes or skin changes?\n\nP: No, not that I know.\n\nD: OK, then how about any muscle aches or joint aches? \n\nP: Uh, no.\n\nD: OK, and have you had any muscle weakness?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: And how has your energy been? Any fatigue?\n\nP: Uhm, it's been mainly OK, just maybe sometimes difficult to get to sleep with all the all the congestion, but I don't think my energy has been affected too much, no.\n\nD: OK, and, uh, sorry to go back to this, I don't think I asked. Did you notice any discharge from your eyes or any eye redness?\n\nP: Not discharge, but yeah, maybe a little bit of redness.\n\nD: OK, have your eyes been itchy?\n\nP: Uhm Yeah, a little bit. I would say they have been a bit itchy.\n\nD: OK, alright then, do you have any medical conditions that you see a physician for regularly? \n\nP: Uh, just uhm, its called dyslipidemia. \n\nD: OK, I see, and any medications you take for that?\n\nP: Just like a Statin medication.\n\nD: OK, do you take any other medications? over the counter? prescribed?\n\nP: No, other than that I take multivitamins.\n\nD: OK, and do you have any allergies to medications or like environmental allergies that might be getting worse?\n\nP: Uh, no, not that I know.\n\nD: OK, so you don't experience any symptoms like this when the seasons change?\n\nP: I don't think so. I have had this happen to me, Uh, I would say like once before. It happened like two years ago. It was pretty similar. \n\nD: OK, uhm, and what was done at that time?\n\nP: At that time it kind of just went away on it's own. It got better. I feel it's definitely worse this time. But at that time I didn't even go to the doctor, it kind of just went away.\n\nD: OK, I see. Any recent hospitalizations?\n\nP: No hospitalizations.\n\nD: Any surgeries?\n\nP: Nope. \n\nD: Alright, and could you tell me where abouts you're living currently and who you're living with?\n\nP: Yeah, so I'm currently living in an apartment by myself, just outside of London.\n\nD: OK, and anybody that you've been around who's had any symptoms?\n\nP: Uh, no, not that I know of.\n\nD: OK, so no sick Contacts. And have you traveled anywhere out of the city or province?\n\nP: No, I've tried to stay home, besides going to work. I just work at the grocery store. Besides that, no, nowhere else.\n\nD: OK, and any of your coworkers have any symptoms? Or any coworkers being off sick?\n\nP: No, we're pretty careful right now with the pandemic.\n\nD: I see, yeah, that's great. OK, and do you smoke cigarettes?\n\nP: No, I quit just a couple of years ago.\n\nD: Oh, that's great. It's not easy to quit, so that's awesome. And do you drink alcohol?\n\nP: Just maybe like red wine a couple of times a week.\n\nD: I see, OK, and do you use any recreational drugs? \n\nP: Uh, just, in a month, maybe once or twice, I smoke a joint.\n\nD: OK, uh, and anybody in the family have any lung or heart conditions?\n\nP: No, not that I know of.\n\nD: Alright, and how about any cancer in the family?\n\nP: Uh, no, no cancers.\n\nD: OK, I think I that was everything I wanted to ask about today. Was there any other symptoms or anything else that you wanted to make sure I knew about today?\n\nP: No,  I think that's all. I just didn't know if I needed any, like, medications or if I needed to get tested. I just wanted to make sure.\n\nD: Yeah, so well, certainly check your temperature to see if you have a fever. And if you do and it's high enough, that will increase the chance that you have a bacterial sinusitis,  and if so, with some of your symptoms, including the discharge, obstruction, loss of smell, and facial pain, that all fits the picture for it and also you had a period where you felt a little bit better and then worse again. So that might require antibiotics, but we will check your temperature and go from there. \n\nP: Alright, sounds good, thank you so much.\n\nD: Thank you.",

[INS:uh] and if you do and its high enough that will increase the chance that you have a bacterial sinusitis [INS:with] and if so with some of your symptoms including the discharge obstruction loss of smell and facial pain that all fits the picture for it [INS:um] and also you [INS:you] [INS:felt] [INS:you] had a period where you felt a little bit better and then worse again [INS:um] so that might require antibiotics [INS:um] but [INS:um] we will [INS:um] [INS:yeah] check your temperature and [INS:um] [INS:uh] go from there [INS:all] [SUB:alright->right] sounds good thank you so much thank

    "human_transcript": "D: Would you mind starting with telling me what brought you in?\n\nP: Sure I have had this cough for the past five days and it doesn't seem to be getting any better so I'm just here to ask you what it what it possibly could be.\n\nD: Has the cough been getting any better, staying the same or getting worse over these last five days?\n\nP: I think it's getting worse.\n\nD: Are you bringing up any any phlegm?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Okay, are you bringing up any blood?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK, have you been coughing at night time as well? Is it interfering with your sleep? Or is the cough just during the day?\n\nP: Um, it is mostly during the day and in the evenings, it doesn't wake me up from sleep.\n\nD: OK, and any triggers that you've notice 5 days ago or anything that changed at that time to bring on the cough?\n\nP: No, nothing.\n\nD: OK. And have you been having any other symptoms with the cough?\n\nP: I have a sore throat and I feel like I can't taste things the same.\n\nD: OK, um, are you having any pain with swallowing either liquids or food?\n\nP: Um, mostly with foods.\n\nD: OK, and when did the sore throat start?\n\nP: It started up around the same time as my cough.\n\nD: OK, and you can't taste your food as well, and when did you notice that?\n\nP: That was two days ago.\n\nD: OK, have you noticed any any loss of smell?\n\nP: No, no I don't think so.\n\nD: OK, and have you had any difficulties breathing or short of breath?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK. And have you had any symptoms like this before?\n\nP: No, nothing like this. \n\nD: OK. And how has your energy level been? Have you been fatigued?\n\nP: A little bit, yes. \n\nD: OK. Have you had any changes to your vision or or hearing? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: Any mucous or pain or discharge from either your ears or nose?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, so your nose hasn't been runny, but has it felt congested?\n\nP: umm, no.\n\nD: OK, have you had any fevers or chills?\n\nP: I don't know about fevers. I guess I was feeling a little bit hot last night, but I didn't take my temperature.\n\nD: OK, so possibly a fever. I will certainly check your temperature today to investigate that. Have you had any night sweats?\n\nP: Umm, no night sweats. \n\nD: Alright. And have you had any weight loss in the last few months? \n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK. And have you had any chest pain?\n\nP: No chest pain.\n\nD: Have you noticed any heart palpitations or heart racing? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: Right, OK, have you had any wheezing?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: Alright. And have you had any abdominal pain?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: Any nausea or vomiting?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, how about any urinary problems? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: Problems like diarrhea or constipation?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, and any muscle aches or or body pains?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Have you had any rashes?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, so the cough started 5 days ago, you had a sore throat, you've been feeling a bit more tired and haven't been able to taste your food for the last couple of days.\n\nP: Yes. \n\nD: OK. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?\n\nP: Um, no, I don't think so.\n\nD: OK, nothing you see a physician regularly for?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Alright, do you take any medications?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Alright, do you know if you have any allergies to medications?\n\nP: Umm, possibly penicillin.\n\nD: OK, do you know what the reaction was?\n\nP: I think I had a rash. \n\nD: OK. Are your immunizations up to date?\n\nP: I think, yeah, I think so.\n\nD: Excellent and any surgeries before? \n\nP: Umm, no. \n\nD: And have you been in the hospital for any reason?\n\nP: Umm, no, no. \n\nD: OK. And are you in school now?\n\nP: I'm in grade 6.\n\nD: OK, cool, what's your favorite class?\n\nP: I would say it's math.\n\nD: Awesome and has there been anybody in your class who's been sick?\n\nP: No, everything's virtual right now.\n\nD: OK cool, so have you traveled anywhere?\n\nP: Umm, no.\n\nD: Alright, and who are you living with?\n\nP: I live with two of my younger siblings and my mom and dad.\n\nD: OK, and is there any physical or verbal abuse in the home?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK, so you do feel safe in the home?\n\nP: Yes yes. \n\nD: OK. And do you smoke cigarettes?\n\nP: I don't. \n\nD: OK and I know some people in your age group might even start using other types of substances. Have you noticed anything like that, or have you used anything like that?\n\nP: Umm, no.\n\nD: OK. And so do you drink? do you drink alcohol?\n\nP: I have had a sip of wine, but that's that's about it.\n\nD: OK, great. And has anybody in your family had had similar symptoms?\n\nP: No, I don't think so. \n\nD: OK, um and anybody in the family have asthma or lung conditions?\n\nP: I think my aunt has asthma but I was I was checked for asthma when I was younger and it turns out I don't have it.\n\nD: OK, and any diseases that run in the family like genetic or congenital?\n\nP: I think Crohn's disease.\n\nD: OK, and umm, who in the family has that?\n\nP: My father. \n\nD: OK, so that was everything that I wanted to ask today, was there anything else you wanted to tell me?\n\nP: No, that's it. What do you think I have?\n\nD: Well, it is sounding like it could be most likely an infectious type of process going on with the possibility of having a fever with a cough and sore throat. So we'll do a physical exam and also some investigations which will include a covid test today. Because some of these symptoms do overlap, but it could be something like the common cold. I don't know the virus that's bringing this on but it's not necessarily covid. But because we're doing the test, it will require 14 days of self isolation. We'll get back to you with the results as quickly as we can.\n\nP: OK, sounds great, thank you.",

the possibility of having a fever with a cough and sore throat so well do a physical exam and also some investigations which will include a covid test today because some of these symptoms do overlap but it could be something like the common cold [SUB:i->like] [SUB:dont->adenovirus] [DEL:know] [DEL:the] [DEL:virus] thats bringing this on [SUB:but->so] its not necessarily covid but because were doing the test it will require 14 days of [SUB:self->selfisolation] [SUB:isolation->and] well get back to you with the results as quickly as we can [SUB:ok->okay] sounds great thank you",

    "human_transcript": "D: How may I help you? \n\nP: I just came in because I've been having this just just yesterday it started this sudden just pain over the front of my kind of like a shoulder an also elbow and it was right after doing I was just doing some workout and this pain just started and it's just like a stabbing sharp pain that hasn't really gone away since then.\n\nD: OK, and so what activity were you doing specifically? \n\nP: So I was doing so I was just doing weight training and I was kind of flexing my elbows and I was working on my biceps. I was on that machine where you so know I wasn't using weights or doing curls, but I was working on my biceps and I think I did hear, I don't think I heard like any pop or anything, but right after that I just had this sudden sharp pain in my shoulder as well as my elbow.\n\nD: OK, so you you you think you heard a pop at that time?\n\nP: Um I'm not sure if I heard a pop. Actually, I think I might have though.\n\nD: OK, and did the pain start immediately or or a bit later on?\n\nP: The pain I think it started pretty soon after, like probably within like half an hour of that happening.\n\nD: OK. And where is the pain located now?\n\nP: The pain right now is a. Yeah, just kind of right at the front of my right elbow as well as near my shoulder as well.\n\nD\" OK. And. Um I think you mentioned the pain as as being sharp is that how you would describe the character of the pain?\n\nP: Yeah, it's sharp. Yeah, I just feel like something stabbing in there.\n\nD: OK, and does the pain radiate anywhere else?\n\nP: No, it's kind of in the same area as they described.\n\nD: OK, has there been anything you've tried to make the pain better?\n\nP: No nothings I tried like Advil nothings really worked. \n\nD: OK. And, uh, sorry. How long is how many days is the pain been on going on for just just started yesterday?\n\nP: Yesterday.\n\nD: OK, and since then has the pain getting any better or any worse?\n\nP: I think it's the same, probably a bit worse than so it just happened last evening and I I didn't end up coming last night, but I wanted to make sure. I'm just coming this morning since it's just been a really painful night.\n\nD: OK, have you done anything that's made the pain worse since last night?\n\nP: No I just tried to just rest and I tried to use some ice, but nothing. Nothing's been working and I kind of also have like this. It it's weird, it's just like this mass right where my biceps is. It kind of just makes my biceps look really big.\n\nD: OK, alright, well I skip look at that during the physical exam component thank you and so like are you seeing swell is there like swelling there is as well or is is that part painful?\n\nP: Yeah, it's painful there swelling there as well.\n\nD: OK. And well, how severe is the pain on a scale of 10 to 1, 10 being the worst pain that you've ever experienced and one being the least.\n\nP: Probably at least an 8, maybe a 9.\n\nD: OK, so the pain is pretty severe then it sounds like. Uh, OK. Have you had any fevers or chills? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: Have you had any unexpected weight loss?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, and have you had any appetite loss?\n\nP: Uhm no.\n\nD: OK, and have you had any headaches?\n\nP: Uhm no. \n\nD: How about any sensory changes like changes to vision or hearing?\n\nP: No, nothing like that.\n\nD: Any changes to your sense of smell or sense of taste?\n\nP: Nope.\n\nD: Have you had a runny nose or a sore throat?\n\nP: Uhm no nothing like that.\n\nD: OK, have you had a cough?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Any shortness of breath?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, any wheezing?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Um have you had any chest pain?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: Have you had any heart palpitations or feeling like your heart's racing?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Any lightheadedness or dizziness?\n\nP: Nope.\n\nD: OK, uh, and have you had any abdominal pain?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Any nausea or vomiting?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Any changes to your bowel movements such as diarrhea or constipation or even blood in the stool.\n\nP: No nothing like that.\n\nD: OK, any urination problems such as pain or frequency?\n\nP: Nope.\n\nD: OK and have you noticed any changes to your skin like rashes or changes to your nails or hair?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Alright, and have you had any neurological symptoms such as numbness or tingling?\n\nP: No, I don't think so. \n\nD: OK, and have you had any muscle weakness?\n\nP: Just just in the in that area, I can't really like. I can't really flex an really move my upper upper arm in my elbow. \n\nD: OK. Do you have any pains in any other joints? \n\nP: Um no that's it's only my right upper arm.\n\nD: OK. Um. And. Have you had any confusion or memory loss?\n\nP: No. OK. And in the past, have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?\n\nP: Uhm no I've been pretty healthy, um I they think I do have like pre diabetes but I'm not on any medication.\n\nD: OK, and have you had any issues with your shoulder before like like a subacromial like impingement syndrome or like a rotator cuff pains or problems in the past?\n\nP: A few years ago I did have some pain um with like some, they they told me not to do like overhead work like just things that require like with Physio I need to do some strengthening as well and it was it wasn't the same same shoulder.\n\nD: OK. And do you take any medications regularly?\n\nP: Uh, no.\n\nD: OK, and do you have any allergies?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Have you had any hospitalizations or prior surgeries? \n\nP: I had my tonsils removed when I was probably like 10 or something, but that's about it.\n\nD: OK, and for the shoulder in the past did you have any imaging done like an ultrasound or or MRI maybe to look at the structures?\n\nP: No, it was just a it kind of went away. I just did some physio they didn't really do any imaging.\n\nD: I see OK. And can you tell me a little about your living situation right now, like you're living with and where?\n\nP: Yeah so I'm living with my wife and um daughter and I'm living just in a condominium in the city.\n\nD: OK, and are you working right now?\n\nP: Yeah, so I'm an accountant. I'm working from home, so it's not that bad, but I I might just take a few days off depending on what I have to do with this injury.\n\nD: OK, and um do you and hobby wise you mentioned like weight lifting, are you an active person like bodybuilding and that sort of thing regularly? \n\nP: I I just actually probably started this past year. I used to. I used to workout a lot. In University and in my early 30s but then I stopped and this year I've kind of gone back into it.\n\nD: OK, well it's good that you're staying active. And um do you smoke cigarettes?\n\nP: No, I uh, probably tried a couple times and. High School and University, but just it was never my thing.\n\nD: OK, and how about cannabis, like smoking marijuana or using any of those types of products?\n\nP: No, I I try to stay away from any drugs.\n\nD: OK, uh, including recreational drugs?\n\nP: Yeah.\n\nD: OK and. Uh, are there any musculoskeletal or neurological problems that that run in the family?\n\nP: Not that I know of, no.\n\nD: OK, now how about any autoimmune diseases?\n\nP: Uh, no, I don't think so.\n\nD: OK, so next I just wanted to ask you to have a look at the at the arm. Compared to the other side, are you noticing any swelling, redness, or?\n\nP: Yeah, any swelling or redness, I do see some just like kind of like in the middle of this area, some redness kind of looks like some bruising in in that in that region. Uhm, I also feel like when I like try to flex my biceps kind of have moved upwards.\n\nD: OK, is this the mass or lump that I you were mentioning earlier that you kinda can notice in the in your right arm? \n\nP: Yeah yeah.\n\nD: OK, is there any temperature change, like does it feel warm on that side?\n\nP: Uhm I can't really tell if it's warm or not.\n\nD: OK, and you so you mentioned are you able to bend your elbow all the way up so to flex it all the way up, or is a range of motion limited?\n\nP: It's pretty limited. It's pretty tough to flex. It's really painful and that I also can't like. I can't turn my arm, I can't supinate.\n\nD: OK so yeah, so is that so you have reduced supination as well?\n\nP: Yeah.\n\nD: And how are your shoulder movement, are you able to like if you're lifting your arms straight out in front of you, are you able to to lift them all the way up above your head?\n\nP: Out like at the sides or in front of me?\n\nD: In front of you. \n\nP: Yeah, the shoulder seems to be OK. I am able to lift up, but it's just if I try to move my upper arms at all it hurts a lot.\n\nD: OK, alright so. You'll get some pain at the at the shoulder with the movement.\n\nP: There there is discomfort in the affected side, but I can I can move it much more than I can move my elbows or anything like that. \n\nD: OK, I see. So I think that was everything that I wanted to ask about and and I look for on on the physical today. Was there anything I may be missed or anything like that? \n\nP: Uhm no I think, uh, I don't have any other questions.\n\nD: OK, alright, so based on the history and what you're telling me for the physical as well of having a history of exercising and also shoulder pain with overhead head movements which are risk factors for developing a biceps, tendon tear or biceps tendon injury. And having the swelling and bruising as well as reduced function of biceps or elbow flexion, they all suggests that there is a biceps, tendon tear, or injury there, and so will want to get an ultrasound or MRI to look at will start with the ultrasound, but then possibly get an MRI as well to look at the extent of the tissue damage, but if there is just a long head of biceps tear, it will usually be treated conservatively. And so we'll just need to look to see what the extent of the injury is.\n\nP: OK.",

there any [INS:uh] temperature change like does it feel warm on that side [INS:um] [SUB:uhm->no] i cant really tell if its warm or not [SUB:ok->okay] and [INS:um] you [SUB:so->see] you mentioned are you able to bend your elbow all the way up [SUB:so->um] to [INS:to] flex it all the way up or is [SUB:a->the] range of motion [INS:uh] limited [INS:uh] its pretty limited its pretty tough to flex [INS:um] its really painful and [SUB:that->then] i also cant like i cant turn my arm [INS:um] [INS:uh] i cant [INS:uh] [INS:arm] [INS:i] [INS:cant] supinate [SUB:ok->okay] so yeah [DEL:so] is that so you have reduced supination as well [DEL:yeah] and how are your shoulder movement are you able to like if youre lifting your arms straight out in front of you are you able to to lift them all the way up above your head [SUB:out->um] like at the sides or in front of me [INS:uh] in front of you yeah the shoulder seems [INS:um] to be [INS:okay] [SUB:ok->uh] i am able to lift up [INS:uh] but its just if i try to move my upper arms at all it hurts a lot [INS:okay] [INS:um] [SUB:ok->all] [SUB:alright->right] so [INS:um] youll get some pain [INS:uh] at the at the shoulder [INS:uh] with the movement [INS:um] there there is discomfort in the affected side [INS:um] but i [SUB:can->i] i can move it much more than i can move my elbows or anything like that [SUB:ok->okay] i see [INS:um] so i think that was everything that i wanted to ask about and and [SUB:i->uh] look for on on [SUB:the->a] physical today was there anything i [SUB:may->i] [SUB:be->maybe] missed or [INS:um] anything like that [SUB:uhm->uh] no i think [SUB:uh->um] i dont have any other questions [SUB:ok->okay] [SUB:alright->uh] so based on the history and what youre telling me for the physical as well [INS:um] of having [INS:uh] a history of exercising [INS:um] and also shoulder pain with overhead head movements which are risk factors for developing a biceps tendon tear or biceps tendon injury and having the swelling and bruising as well as reduced function of biceps or elbow flexion [SUB:they->it] all suggests that there is a biceps tendon tear or injury there and so [SUB:will->well] want to get an ultrasound or mri to look at [SUB:will->well] start with the ultrasound but then possibly get an mri as well to look at the extent of the tissue damage but if there is just a long head of biceps tear it will usually be treated conservatively and so well just need to look to see what the extent of the injury is [SUB:ok->okay]",

    "human_transcript": "00:02:02\n[Speaker 1]: So, What brought you here today?\n00:04:99\n\n00:06:100\n[Speaker 2]: Doctor, I have been having shortness of breath, and I have been feeling fatigue for the past two weeks. The pain is just so much; you know how bad it is when you are struggling with your breath. Then another thing is fatigue. The fatigue  is just constant, it never goes, it doesn't want to go.\n00:32:98\n\n\n00:34:99\n[Speaker 1]: Okay, So can you tell me more about it?\n00:37:03\n\n00:37:98\n[Speaker 2]: When it starts, it feels as if I am, I am looking for my breath, as in, as in I am gasping for my breath, like something is choking me, as if I am going to die the next minute and it actually started small gradually.\n00:57:99\n\n00:59:01\n[Speaker 1]: Okay. I will be asking you few more questions about that. You said shortness of breath started gradually. Can you explain on the fatigue, Is there any thing you do that makes it worse?\n01:12:00\n\n01:12:98\n[Speaker 2]: Yes Doctor. The fatigue is just constant. It doesn't go at all and it doesn't matter what I do, it will still be there and it doesn't even have any time that it use to come. I always feel the same way morning, afternoon and night. The thing is just there.\n01:36:02\n\n01:38:99\n[Speaker 1]: Okay, Is there any other symptoms you get, like chest pain, palpitation, dizziness, or fainting?\n01:44:00\n\n\n01:45:02\n[Speaker 2]: No, not at all, just cough.\n01:53:01\n\n01:54:98\n[Speaker 1]: Okay, When the cough comes, How long does it last? Does it come during the day or at night? At what time does it normally come?\n02:02:03\n\n02:04:01\n[Speaker 2]: The truth is that the cough comes, it comes on its own, but mostly, it used to come at night. It used to disturb me well at night.\n02:17:00\n\n02:18:99\n[Speaker 1]: Okay, Is there any other thing that makes the shortness of breath worse? Like standing up, lying flat, exertion? Do you feel relieved by any of those things?\n02:29:98\n\n02:31:04\n[Speaker 2]: Yes, yes it's worse on exertion and even when I'm lying flat. But, but whenever I shift like this and sit down, sit up, I will feel better. The thing will no longer be disturbing me that much again. So I think its better when I'm sitting up.\n02:55:01\n\n02:56:98\n[Speaker 1]: Okay, on a scale of 1-10, Can you describe how bad it is?\n03:01:02\n\n03:02:100\n[Speaker 2]: I would say 10 Doc. 10\n03:06:01\n\n03:07:01\n[Speaker 1]: Okay, What do you think could be causing this?\n03:09:99\n\n03:12:03\n[Speaker 2]: I don't know. I really don't know.\n03:15:02\n\n03:18:01\n[Speaker 1]: Are you worried about it?\n03:19:99\n\n\n03:22:04\n[Speaker 2]: I am really scared, I am afraid because my father died of stroke. I am scared.\n03:29:02\n\n03:30:99\n[Speaker 1]: I am sorry to hear about that. It must have been very difficult.  Is there any thing you think I can help you do today?\n03:40:02\n\n03:42:02\n[Speaker 2]: Doc, You have so many things to for me because I want to feel better. I just want you to tell me that I will be fine and you would do everything in your power to make sure that I am fine.\n03:57:100\n\n03:58:99\n[Speaker 1]: okay, if I heard you correctly, you said you've been having shortness of breath, and you've been feeling fatigued for the past two weeks.

I don't use recreational drugs.\n\n03:06:98\n[Speaker 1]: Okay, So, are you currently taking any medications, either prescribed or over the counter? Are you currently taking any one right now?\n\n03:14:00\n[Speaker 2]: No, I'm not taking any medications.\n\n03:17:00\n[Speaker 1]: Okay, so, Do you have any known allergies to medications or food?\n\n03:21:99\n[Speaker 2]: No, I don't have any known allergies.\n\n03:24:99\n[Speaker 1]: Okay, so As part of our examination, I'll like to ask you some questions about your gynaecological health. Have you noticed any changes in your menstrual cycle recently?\n\n03:39:01\n[Speaker 2]: No, my menstrual cycle has been normal.\n\n03:41:98\n[Speaker 1]: Okay, Have you had any abnormal vaginal discharge, itching or pain?\n\n03:48:01\n[Speaker 2]: No, everything has been normal in that area.\n\n03:50:98\n[Speaker 1]: Okay, Noted. Have you ever been pregnant and if so how many times?\n\n03:57:97\n[Speaker 2]: yes, I have two children\n\n04:00:96\n[Speaker 1]: So, did you have any complications during your pregnancies and deliveries?\n\n04:05:97\n[Speaker 2]: No, they were both normal pregnancies and deliveries.\n\n04:09:96\n[Speaker 1]: So, have you had any recent gynaecological exams or screenings?\n\n04:13:100\n[Speaker 2]: No, I haven't had any recently.\n\n04:16:99\n[Speaker 1]: Okay,Have you ever had any gynaecological surgery, such as a hysterectomy or ovarian surgery?\n\n04:26:01\n[Speaker 2]: No,I haven't had any gynaecological surgeries.\n\n04:30:01\n[Speaker 1]: Okay, okay, have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections?\n\n04:36:98\n[Speaker 2]: no, I've never had any STIs.\n\n04:41:00\n[Speaker 1]: Okay, okay.

Have you had any pelvic pain unrelated to your menstrual cycle?\n\n04:59:96\n[Speaker 2]: No, I haven't had any pelvic pain.\n\n05:02:96\n[Speaker 1]: Okay, so thank you Kemi. Based on your responses, your gynaecological health seems to be normal. now lets continue with the examination of your leg. so based on your on our discussion, i'll like to perform a physical examination to better understand what might be causing your symptoms. we'll start by examining your leg, your left leg and checking your temperature.\n\n05:35:01\n[Speaker 2]: Okay, Doctor\n\n05:38:00\n[Speaker 1]: Okay, so based on your symptoms and examination,it's possible that you have a condition called deep vein thrombosis, which is a blood clot in one of the deep veins in your leg. This can cause pain, swelling and fever especially if the clot breaks loose and travels to your lungs causing a pulmonary embolism. However, we will need to confirm this with some tests, such as an ultrasound of your leg, and we will also check for any signs of infection, such as cellulitis. In the meantime, we are going to prescribe some drugs, some medication to help with the pain and the swelling. so, that's what we're gonna do for now.\n\n06:31:98\n[Speaker 2]: Okay sir. thank you, doctor,\n\n06:33:96\n[Speaker 1]: okay, so is there anything else you'll like to discuss?\n\n06:37:01\n[Speaker 2]: No, Doctor. Thank you for your help.\n\n06:39:98\n[Speaker 1]: you are welcome, Kemi. we'll get to the bottom of this together and make sure you are feeling better soon. take care.",

    "human_transcript": "00:00:00\n[Speaker 2]: Ok. Doctor i have been experiencing rectal bleeding for the past two weeks and it is gotten worse. Starting off as a little bit of blood in my stool but now there's quite alot of bright red blood mixed in. I have also had change of this in my bowel cavity, going from regular to alternating between my constipation and diarrhea and i have lost some weight unintentionally and i have been feeling really tired lately \n\n00:36:03\n[Speaker 1]: Ok. Giving these symptoms. Can i? I want to start by asking you a few more questions to understand your condition better. First is have you notice any blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet room?\n\n01:02:01\n[Speaker 2]: Yes. I definitely notice blood on the toilet paper. Sometimes there's even blood dripping into the toilet after i finished going into the bathroom \n\n01:16:99\n[Speaker 1]: Ok. That a significant amount of bleeding. So i want to investigate on this further. So i want to ask you about your diet. Have you notice any changes in your appetite or the food you're eating? \n\n01:35:03\n[Speaker 2]: To be honest, my appetite has been i little bit up lately. I have been feeling an unusual. I have been having to force myself to eat sometimes. I haven't really made a big changes to my diet though\n\n01:53:02\n[Speaker 1]: Ok. So Thank you for sharing this information. I have a few more questions to ask about your medical history and family history and all. First can you tell me about your past medical history including any surgeries or hospitalizations?\n\n02:21:00\n[Speaker 2]: I haven't really had any major surgeries or hospitalizations in the past. I have high blood pressure but it is well controlled with medication \n\n02:33:98\n[Speaker 1]: Ok. That's good to hear. And regarding your family history can you tell me about your family history either your mom or your dad?\n\n02:54:03\n[Speaker 2]: Regarding my family. My father passed away from colorectal cancer \n\n03:02:02\n[Speaker 1]: Ok\n\n03:04:02\n[Speaker 2]: That's about it and my mother has breast cancer about 10 years ago but she's been in remission for several years now. I think other than that I can't think of any other illness or cancers that run in my family \n\n03:23:98\n[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. So a family history of cancer especially colorectal cancer and breast cancer can increase your risk for developing certain cancers. But now let's talk about your social history. Do you drink or smoke?\n\n03:55:100\n[Speaker 2]: I don't smoke and i quit about 10 years ago but i do drink on occasional events \n\n04:06:02\n[Speaker 1]: That's great. Quiting smoking can be significantly reduce your of developing several types of cancer. Now let's move on to allergies. Do you have known allergies either to medications or other substance?\n\n04:29:99\n[Speaker 2]: No. I don't have any known allergies. I have never had any issues with medication or anything else like that \n\n04:38:01\n[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. Now based on your symptoms and family history and social history there are few possible conditions that could be causing these symptoms. One possibility as you mentioned is colorectal cancer and other possibility include  inflammatory bowel disease, polyps or hemorrhoids and diverticulosis. To confirm all these conditions i would like to have some test including colonoscopy and blood test \n\n05:21:00\n[Speaker 2]: A colonoscopy sounds a bit intimidating. Can you tell me more about what it involves? And what you expect to find? \n\n05:33:98\n[Speaker 1]: I understand your concern and i may know a colonoscopy is a procedure where a flexible tube and a camera is inserted through the rectum and into the colon. You know, to examine of the large intestine. So it is very common and safe procedure that is used to screen for and diagnosed for colon and rectum condition. So i expect to find the cause of your symptoms whether it is cancer, polyps or something else. So you see during the colonoscopy if we find any polyps or areas of concern, we can remove small samples of the tissue for further examination. This is known as biopsy. We can also take biopsies of any abnormal looking areas in the colon lining. So to sample will then be sent to a lab for analysis to determine if they are cancerous or benign \n\n06:44:03\n[Speaker 2]: What will happen if biopsy result shows that i have cancer doctor?\n\n06:52:02\n[Speaker 1]: Ok. Excuse me, if the biopsy results comes back as positive for cancer then we will discuss the best treatment options for you \n\n07:08:98\n[Speaker 2]: Thank you for answering all my questions doctor. I feel a bit more informed now but also more nervous about the possibility of a cancer\n\n07:20:01\n[Speaker 1]: I understand how you feel but remember that catching any potential issues early can make a big difference. I am here to support you through this process and i will schedule the test and i will take one step at a time. So please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns \n\n07:45:02\n[Speaker 2]: Thank you. I will be waiting for the test result and i appreciate your help \n\n07:50:99\n[Speaker 1]: You are very much welcome. \n\nSo based on my findings from the symptoms you shared and the information shared from the patient. There's rectal bleeding for two weeks worsening over time and change in bowel habit. There's no significant past medical history, Family history and there's also family history of colorectal and breast cancer. There's no current smoking but occasional alcohol consumption and there are no allergies. So the possible diagnosis includes colorectal cancer which is the most likely based on the symptom, family history and also social history and also the second diagnosis could be inflammatory bowel disease which is known as the IBD which is less likely due to lack of abdominal pain or diarrhea.\"\n\n-1:28:-1-1:28:-1",

The patient, a 45 year old female complains of frequent urination and excessive thirst which has lasted for 2 weeks, and this frequent urination occurs mostly at night. And the patient complains, says there is no burning sensation or associated pain during urination. My diagnosis is, I suspect the patient has diabetes mellitus specifically type 2 diabetes. The symptoms of frequent urination, excessive thirst, fatigue and unintentional weight loss are classic signs of diabetes. For further diagnosis, I will request a fasting plasma glucose test and a oral glucose tolerance test.\n05:33:98",

She finds it difficult to keep down food or liquid. She started vomiting undigested food recently but is no blood or bile on it. The condition is associated with severe nausea and weight loss. She doesn't have any history of fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain or headache. Her last menstrual period was 8 weeks ago and her pregnancy test read positive. She has no history of similar symptoms in the previous pregnancy, neither does the condition occur when she's not pregnant. She hasn't done any surgery in the past and doesn't have any chronic illness. She also have no family history of similar illness. Mrs. Oge, according to her, does not smoke nor drink. She's not also in any prescription drugs, but she maintained that she started prenatal vitamins after she confirmed pregnant. She doesn't have any known food or drug allergies.\n05:49:96",
